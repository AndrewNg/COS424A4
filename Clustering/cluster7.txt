He has been the best transition defender in the league the last couple of years `\Curry going 1-12 shouldn't be brought up. It happened in the game. The Spurs have a great defense.

And sure, he didn't play, but Duncan only played 8 minutes.

The Spurs can beat the Warriors, healthy or not. This game shouldn't mean less`\They didn't because their game plan was a fast paced, switch everything defense since GS had no C. If they had Bogut or Ezeli their plan for today would have had more difficulty controlling GS. `\Over here in Celtics land bumming about our 14 game home winning streak being snapped when I look up and see the Warriors have won FORTY SEVEN in a row at Oracle??? What?!?!?`\Andy looked like a fool on a couple defensive plays there. Time for Mo to come in.`\Russell shooting 50% from 3 with 3 steals against the best offense/defense combination in decades, that might be more impressive than his 39 point game. First game I missed all season and it's probably our best half. Dammit.`\That's 3 days to party in LA. `\Golden State won a game they definitely didn't deserve to win tonight, and that's coming from a fan.`\Baron was doing great and stephen jackson was fresh off beating up some fans so they were big news when we got them.  But oh man watching Meyers Leonard out there tonight was giving me some serious Troy Murphy flashbacks. DO NOT WANT!`\Finally no one blames Kobe for going 4-14.`\even better! i like him when he's pissed!`\Meeee toooo!!!! Goddamn!`\God, this team and turnovers. `\Keep in mind, the last time these two teams met at Oracle the Spurs got absolutely demolished.

Warriors had a horrible game shooting-wise, 3 major players out and they still kept the game close the entire 4 quarters.

I think you have it backwards, I think the Warriors can steal one in San Antonio but I don't think the Spurs can win at Oracle. `\>except Mo

Those teams don't look better with their new coaches `\How many games`\No worries, Dray can put the skill back in the ball and Curry can get it from there`\Mainly because it's impossible.

The crowd would go nuts if Wilt popped out of his grave, caught an uber to Staples and scored a 100....because that's equally as impossible as Kobe throwing it down. `\No they were down by more with less time left to the Pelicans in Round 1 last year.`\I think the Spurs would be better off with Patty in there instead of Parker.`\Leonard's a future HOFer`\But not falling for Curry.  We need him if we gonna win.`\Blinded by that gleaming bald spot`\Agreed.

No ones saying the Spurs were handed this game--they played well enough to win, and they won. No asterisks. Cleveland fans are welcome to say they're proud of their team extending the champs to six games--and stop there.`\I saw it too.

But you can come down to my Y and find out...`\We need a ref game thread.`\TRAVEL`\I kinda agree with Van Gundy.  He's gonna have to bitch at the refs at some point because he was getting few calls and had two really bad calls against him that game.  He didn't say a word and just walked back down court.  Great to see a player do that but gotta let the refs know when they fucked up sometimes.  `\I CAN'T REMEMBER THE LAST TIME HUERTAS SHOT TWICE`\Klay and Steph 1-18 from three...`\> They played their best defensive half of the season

Maybe that's the reason those guys haven't hit 3s`\"Oh shit"`\this is fucking horseshit. give me a break cause Kawhi sure aint getting any`\Da Fuq who said that ? `\I swear that's some sorta movie`\Curry 6-20, Klay 7-20, combined 1-18 from 3.`\Thank you man`\Refs have been bad both ways, so neither side really has them to blame at this point. They've been evenly terrible.`\try being a rockets fan lol`\He's a Maverick.

Sorry! I'll leave now! `\Holy fuckkkkkkkkkk`\It was the thought that counted. `\Yeah I guess you're right. It's just really cool that you guys get to do that and I'm just jelly`\It's exactly like Oscar said. All you have to do is play defense.

WE GOT THIS!!!`\Can't tell if great defense or poor execution. I'll say the former. `\I don't think so either but it has to have been a while`\Tony Parker answers back. This is fun`\Fuck that `\need bogut/ezeli right now, diaws fatass is too much right now`\Shocker`\It's not the first time he has wasted his last timeout in a close game which ended up backfiring awfully and prevented advancing the ball a few plays later.  He's just a bad head coach.`\http://i.imgur.com/1F4QL1x.gif`\Dammit bring back Nance and Bass `\uh yeah. the amount of phonebanking, donations, canvassing, etc. that the sub has produced for Bernie is insane. it's hilarious seeing people on Reddit do the anti-jerk over and over. we get it, you guys don't like seeing so much Bernie stuff on r/all. Reddit is a site that is used to promote him immensely, get over it. I don't even use the sub or campaign for him as much as so many other people there, but it's pretty disgusting to see people say "I mean I might just have to vote Clinton so this annoying Bernie shit ends"
`\Hmm, idk, I don't think this is a good comparison haha. Don't get me wrong, both teams are on opposite ends of the league table, but I don't think it would cause /r/soccer to explode like this sub has haha.

I thought the Lakers were a good team anyway. Did they just suddenly become shit in the last few years?`\Wait I don't get it.  `\Lmaooo I didn't get to watch the game but what exactly happened out there? `\LOL THE SMILE TO POP`\Enrique you are fucking useless`\Settle down there`\Cavs aren't making it to the Finals, just got their shit packed in by the Heat and it will happen 4 more times in the playoffs.`\Lol Jesus christ`\Iguodala too. He's actually pretty good at tracking down rebounds and we're getting killed on the boards. `\I blame Varejao. I just don't like his body language. Low energy. I hope Ezeli comes back soon.
Edit: I've no legit reason to blame Varejao for this game but  I just don't believe in him. He's not a good fit, will not be a good fit. `\God, i always feel so cringey when mark jackson commentates these games. `\Warrior fans SHOULD NOT have a problem with Barnes walking this summer, he's not worth the max imo. `\wew`\That dude sitting next to Duncan has a HUGE head`\it's been like this all game.

The longest Eastern Conference winning streak has been 2, by the Miami Heat in 2012 and 2013 (this is the only win streak by the East).

That's the way I was thinking he drew that up. I could be wrong of course and it could totally have been stealth tanking. But I'd assume Watson wanted some higher percentage shots, even though Knight was en fuego at the end.

Expect lots of warm and fuzziness in this thread for the Wolves for just being there in the end, but it would have been nice to see a winning play out of one of their guys at the end, and I guess nights like these are the "the point" and Lakers and Magic fans would kill to put their guys in positions like tonight.  `\Mitchell needs to get KAT more involved in crunch time instead of calling Wiggins Iso's all the damn time.`\-32 against Portland so yes`\[Lakers beat Warriors, Dodgers beat Giants in ST](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4UqMyldS7Q)`\JUMP SHOOTIN TEAMS ERNEH`\Shout out to the turd bagel downvoting Dubs flair.`\Turnovers gotta stop`\We need to feed Diaw.`\Is it Jackson I'm at the bar so I can't hear the commentary but he is still bitter we fired him`\2016 NBA championship crowned tonight `\Had to be tiring for the Wolves starters when they came out, I heard they had to stand due to not having a bench.`\I feel like Klay Thompson is kinda under appreciated.

*personal feelings aside. it statistically increases spurs chances of winning`\Can't wait to get an ovo kd jersey `\> There's just nothing you can do to stop this team. If they lose it's because they played poorly.

I wrote this somewhere else:

    To beat GSW you need at least two of the following three:

    1. Near-perfect defence
    2. Near-perfect offence
    3. GSW has an off night


Spurs can mostly always do 1, but they can be iffy on 2. The game where they beat GSW, it was 1 and 3. `\The long con. I love it.`\Kerr didn't know what pop was going to do. He already had the lineup in mind.`\You win young fella.`\1st quarter is usually their best quarter.

Spurs always come in hot in the 3rd though. `\Shaun money shot`\Anyone see that guy in the crowd grab it before Barbosa could? `\I thought the game was at 7:30 pacific time not eastern time. someome tell me it was a boring game and i didnt miss shit.`\whoosh`\Aldridge was a monster! `\what the fuck `\> Dad: hehe nobody would have believed this

That string of comments was actually not that unreasonable.`\Dunn or Bender imo`\Why does klay always kill us.`\Bogut really coming up huge for us. Working both ends of the floor and 4 clutch free throws. `\The game hasn't even started and I feel like it's time for a rebuild. `\Defense does that, hopefully a couple shots go down for Warriors or it might get bad`\Yup! That's the one. `\The takeaway from this game is Curry banking a corner 3. Physics officially broken. `\pretty much no defenders to guard him without Bogut`\I didn't watch. Did they put Leonard on Curry all night?`\Yeah, this applies more to Portland against Aldridge if anything.`\I'm glad the Warriors pulled that one out - if not /u/Rabsho would have jumped off a building.`\his off ball D is lacking imo`\They were partying their asses off thinking they'd have an easy one. `\Andy thank you`\ref didn't signal klay hitting it, so even if he did it's a shitty call`\Peterson is the best local color guy there is`\He was helping out the wolves bigs`\Are you not happy with the Mavs having 12 more FTA than Warriors?`\McAdoo over the back? `\How come warriors  haven't won at spurs since 1997?`\David Lee out hustling the Dubs.`\It looks like an ASG when nobodies want to hurt themselves.`\I still cant decide who i want to win, on the one hand i really want to see my lakers win, on the other hand i really want the warriors to break that record, and we need that draft pick.`\Every flair that isn't GSW and every comment that is anti-GSW was getting downvoted by at least 3 people. Probably just a couple of butthurt fans. It'll go away soon.`\ABC definitely has the audio ahead of the video. Really evident when Klay hit the post jumper over Parker. `\bail out call`\Does anyone really think Anthony Davis is getting his taxes done at H&R Block? `\Man, that was a good one.`\I complimented kawhi, so now let me shit on the one of the Spurs:

wtf is happening with kyle Anderson's hairline???`\AMAZING fucking game! `\Unfortunately, I am.`\Hope Klay can shoot >50% tomorrow... so streaky :/`\Nah we done with OKC we only play them 3x this year`\fuckit, lets win out`\If the Warriors had lost, we'd be hearing about it for the next week.`\We're missing gimmies, GSW lucky`\"I told ya Erneh"`\They take everything from us`\If Steph is human we ar fucked`\Especially if they're playing the front runner for MVP.`\down by 6 only playing like that and missing our three main defenders... i'll take it.`\You know Dirk's going to want revenge for 2007 too `\there were several instances when he was wide open though, something wasnt right today with Curry.`\I meant spurs`\I'm not overlooking Portland, but I'm definitely not concerned, either. Of the four teams fighting for the final three spots, the Dubs are going to annihilate whoever they play. It's just the truth.`\Randle misses a ton of gimmes and makes that dumbass push shot. Ah well. Just scored again. Just had to keep on pushing.`\We have Ron Jacobs`\Holy shit Warriors cannot get anything to fall...`\has david lee lost weight or gained more muscle or something? he looks fucking good. damn. `\Well the refs are fucking over Kawhi. That's not helping.`\He fucked up those two plays, but he defended very well tonight.  Singlehandedly stopped a curry fast break along with tight perimeter defense.  With a bench player, that's all you can ask for.  Whether or not he should be in the game in crunch time is a different story.  CP and Redick not showing up hurt the team wayyyy more than Rivers tonight.  The team lost with bad fouls, poor rebounding, along with good perimeter defense from GS, not because of Austin's defense`\Controversial statement there `\I'm very pleased with the mutual respect being shown between Warriors and Spurs fans this season. Whatever happens tonight, Fuck the Clippers. `\so that's what happens when curry isn't god`\Draymond's been feeling it these past couple of games. Glad he's back to form.`\Christ what a horrible last few minutes to end the Q`\What? You're dominating them. So many wide open missed 3s and you're still up.`\Well Golden State has the 4th quarter to grab a cup of coffee and flush out more of that hang-over`\Danny Green just got Danny Green'd`\Are you really comparing a teams win loss record that began in 1946 to a team who started in 1970 and has been in the shadow of the Lakers for most of it?!?!?!?!?  `\Five minutes is a long time with the Warriors. Hoping the Lakers can pull it off to give the Bulls record a chance, but I'll believe it when the clock hits 0:00.`\That would be more of a miracle than actually winning. `\He isn't hitting shit anyways`\We gonna have a 130 point half? `\WutFace`\It will never top Undercover Boss`\I need the WCF immediately.`\> shit

Lol, they beat us and then fall outside of top 2 (Simmons/Ingram) in the lottery.`\Getting dome from Riri on the night when they win back to back threepeats`\That looked clean...`\Refs`\Dude's get mauled wtf`\Is this the only thing you post?`\Good defensive game from both ends.`\Yeah.

FUCK NO`\29.6% shooting. But ya, like basically shot like 15%.`\89 or 90. They played amazing physical defense. Swept the Lakers and damn near swept the Blazers. `\Okay?`\I understand that Dre and Bogut are both hurt but I actually thought that the other guys were good at defense too. The Warriors are giving up a crazy amount of points lately.`\Oooh, so in order to win lots of games you have to make almost every shot no matter how ridiculous? Oh.`\https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CSN3TMFXAAA_9dF.jpg`\Jump shootin teams Erneh`\We're the Warriors of moral victories.`\you have to make that shot in NBA.

However they only won by 8 with gsw down 3 players and klay and curry playing like shit. Curry will def not play like this in a 7 game series. On the other hand spurs had turnover problems which usually doesnt happen. Therefore in a 7 game series it would be really hard to predict who would win. `\everything's bigger in new york`\Why does it have to be a taco bruh?`\I'm honestly down to keep Huertas.

1.) Manu in my, and many many other peoples opinion is one of, if not THE best 6th man ever.

2.) The Spurs can beat the Warriors in a 7 game series. If I had to put a % on it, I would say 30% chance to the Spurs win it all, and 70% the Warriors do, but I think it more than possible. The Spurs are going to be extremely motivated to get Timmy, Manu, probably West, possibly Parker their last chance at a chip.

I think those odds go up or down dramatically depending on if (as you have annoyingly pointed out through this thread) key players are injured/unhealthy, but that is the nature of the game.`\We be crippled so that when we beat the wins record the haters can't say anything about health like our championship`\**FUCK THE CELTICS**`\I'm getting closer to crying.

Definitely need some improvements but small sample sizes are exactly that. Even worse when you are missing 3 key defenders.

wait that does sound like what I am saying.`\Our body language is so bad right now. We look really flat`\Even the fucking Warriors can't defeat the Spurs at home.`\And here I was hoping this game would be a refreshing change of pace from all the ugly ass college games from today

For real though, gg Spurs`\Might be time to give Steph a day off. Dude seems like he needs a mental break.`\Mo is gonna go drink several Budweisers™ now`\When he was "the man" post all star break he put up 22/5/8. Booker as the man right now is also trending upwards at a crazy rate. But he's also 19, while Steph was 21.`\we can't break the 72 record playing the way we play now`\Maybe then they could finally manage to get DJ to improve `\Dubs sleepwalking through this game, it's frustrating`\Still a rookie dude. He's a beast on rebounds and still trying to find a good jumpshot. Give the guy time, then we'll see if he's a capable starter or not. To us, he seems good enough to be a capable starter, but there's plenty more to see from this guy.`\That was when WUCK FES and Swaggy went off on the 3 pt end.`\Any place to watch the full game ?`\"Warriors fans"`\Bobo is playing well though, and is scoring. I don't know what you mean by "excuse"?`\Klay doin work!`\They don't really need t-shirts to make it a white out. `\I've got a Warriors flair, I try to give everyone the benefit of the doubt since I have no friends ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯`\they are way too full of themselves at the moment `\Un be fucking lievable calls against leonard`\yeah wtf`\Empty beer bottles around?`\I don't know he pretty much matched his league average in stats.  `\Bogut is injured`\As long as you're still excited with each win, you're probably not cocky. `\HERE COMES AUSTIN RIVERSSS`\http://i.imgur.com/1F4QL1x.gif`\Oh really you do? Gosh the Warriors are so unique! `\To be fair though the Warriors could have 30 puts right now, they've missed like 6 wide open 3s`\No I'm pretty sure it's a shooting foul and the person who got fouled shoots the free throw`\That fucking defense`\Anyone know the rules for music during games? Spurs seem to have full volume music going throughout their offensive possessions. `\Can we just get back to the fucking game?`\Now would be a good time for Klay to go for another 37 point quarter.`\What the hell was that call on Kawhi lol

Makeup for the blown continuation?`\wuttt??? r u high??`\MJ would have made that play.`\Curry is human after all.

Can't expect the same thing with a full GSW roster`\Are you from Central Texas? Don't care, upvotes for you all day`\GG, I used to live in Scottsdale (I went to ASU for undergrad), and rooted for the SSOL Suns, attended a handful of games, loved the atmosphere there. Your fans are all hardcore passionate about the Suns, far more than the dbacks or cards, (I was even there for the SB run, fuck the Steelers btw, and I remember thinking, "this is still a Basketball market more than anything," though I know that the Coyotes were crazy popular for a while - I just don't follow hockey).


Hope you guys can get back to the playoffs soon. The Suns, Dubs, and Kings should form a Pacific division alliance called "Operation: Kill L.A." - wherein we curb stomp both LA teams collectively each season to ensure neither of them ever reach the post-season again. Just a thought, send it back if you aren't feeling it...`\The Blazers did in Portland.

But I agree, it's not a viable strategy. `\Giving up on the Black Falcon that easily, eh?`\Best shot at beating them at home the league will have all season.

`\Didn't watch the game. How does one get 1 fast break point?`\Fair enough man. I don't agree with you, but that would be something else if it happened.`\Hibbert what the fuck `\Having second thoughts about wanting to throw 20mil a year at Barnes. Maybe he's still feeling the effects of the injury but damn.`\Hahaha I will considering they're so few `\Yeah definitely looked like he slid under him`\Dray surprises me with his 3`\I think the dubs are gonna take this. Feels like theyre getting ready to really open it up.`\I agree, the burritos are lackluster but that sauce ... mmmmmmm`\Upset about? `\Wan't feeling well and was questionable for the game. `\Already are 8th seed and its not too likely we make playoffs`\there is something about Russel that i dont like but not sure what it is..

probably that he is like so hype for himself `\I can't wait to beat your asses in the Conference finals. Also, are you going through GSW/SA thread from a few days ago and just contacting random Spurs fans to rub their noses in a regular-season loss to a playoff team? Or just the ones the replied to your nonsense in the first place? Either way, not a good look for a true fan.

btw kid, it's "they're"`\Klay is on fire tonight.`\He reminds me of those Bad Boy Pistons or old Celtic team mentality`\Warriors happened.`\#SPURS WIN.

Hopefully we can get some bench players and some draft picks for them. `\I put 25 on the Warriors to win straight up at that point! `\the truth hurts. trade him while his value is high breh`\Yeah, I know, just saying Bogut was generating decent offense for you, would have kept him in over Andy who will kill your pace`\Oh my god what a fucking awful game from the Warriors.`\Only rain for SoCal today boys`\byron benched russell. fuck that piece of shit`\Honestly, my biggest hope is that there are no injuries. To either team.`\gsw saturday jerseys would be way better imo without those fuckin sleeves, but the same could be said about all sleeved jerseys`\A lost art.`\Dlee never killed the glass like that for us haha`\if that's a foul I'm a cows momma`\Aldridge just slammed him hard too, knocked him right off his spot`\Barbosa and Diaw are talking about hanging out with Nash later`\How is that on KAT?`\What's wrong with Steph?`\Oh`\fuck curry was 1-12 from 3pt range`\Based Nance`\Eddie Furs probably works at Burger King`\WTF OFF THE BACKBOARD FROM THAT ANGLE LOLOLOL

It doesn't seem right. `\**WE BELIEVE** `\Do one for our whole team from the 3 point line.`\>SPURS BALL!

Holy shit this is the worst arena in sports`\That light up three line is so distracting. `\I saw that but even then to score 11 points and get 6 more boards in the remaining 10 minutes is efficient as fuck`\Kickball?`\It's not a foul on the guy attempting the layup... it's a foul on the guy who got pushed... so yes? If I foul someone, does the person with the ball just automatically get to have a shooting foul called on him too? `\Harrison drives left ALL the time`\Well, he leads the Association in that category`\GG San Antonio.  Awesome game...  even thought GSW lost.. great game none the less.`\I dunno why are they downvoting you, it was great defense by both teams.

Mavs are the best spoiler team in the league. They'll take anyone to 7 games. This has the making of a spectacular playoff series.`\Shit, I completely forgot about Dre tonight. Crazy how the rest of the team can step up so well and just make it look like he was never there.

That being said, hurry back Dre! Need you for the Spurs and Kawhi. `\That was a 2k shot `\Didn't get to see this

Warriors playing down to lakers?`\Lol.`\As much as I dislike GSW, they really needed their big guys out there. Spurs were bodying em for the boards`\I think I have at least one idea why...`\Warriors starting the game half asleep, as usual.`\Lol wtf`\I don't. It's just nice to see Curry having shitty nights too like a normal person `\How was that not a kicked ball?`\No you are not. Multiple people have said the same thing in previous game threads.`\Flooooooooop`\Steph, if he wasnt curry, is def a chucker.

The shots he has been taking is not of quality and are early in the possession.
`\I'm just waiting for the Spurs or Warriors (or possibly thunder) too be coming in off of 2 nuts 7 game series absolutely gassed and get beaten by an east team coming off a sweep or 5 game series.

That would be too funny (as a neutral).`\NaCl`\Yup. Just have to make Curry/Klay/Barnes/Green collectively shoot 10% from 3. Easy as pie.`\I hope you lose again. Thankfully.`\Could also be that Speights just played himself into shape`\We've had more in a quarter than we now have in a half. Multiple times.`\I've never liked him in the first place, and I am not a fan of either team`\yeah shot them like curry and thompson and we have no problems m8

edit: thomson-->thompson`\Warriors didn't break 80, and we barely won. At home. Where we're on a 44-game win streak. I'm scared guys.

Edit: I'm also excited. I think it's clear GS has the advantage, but how often do you get to see two historically great teams in the same season?`\Okay...`\Usually he is more clutch but that was fucking ugly.`\My heart can't handle games like this. GG Hawks`\Win = we beat this great Warriors team

Lose= the tank

I'm happy either way `\Dirty ass fucking screens`\Lakers are playing pretty good, Clarkson has made some great shots. Curry and Thompson both shooting bad. Warriors had lots of turnovers the first half and the Lakers only had one the first half.`\FUCK THE TANK, WE JUST FUCKED THE PROGRESS OF GS BEATING THE RECORD`\Somebody needs to make a fake Curry retirement letter that would be hilarious`\yeah and playing well too looking at the boxscore`\[Warriors right now](http://i.imgur.com/x1krEEi.jpg)`\what a homer`\Lets just skip to the second round of the playoffs right now`\Not their night`\moral victories dont count in the playoffs, mang`\This is so true. Bandwagoners are only annoying when they pretend to be "true" fans. Otherwise its just fun to talk to new people about Curry doing retarded shit. Literally everyone I know now follows the Warriors to some extent`\Warriors playing like a bunch of scrubs right now!`\What the fuck can I have some context please? Why is Bieber telling Henrik Lundqvist about his jerking habits`\> 24hr

that's a long shot clock...`\I remember when gsw would foul Houston's players so they wouldnt get 3 pointers off.`\Wolves defense is either unstoppable or tissue paper. Sometimes both at once.`\What are you guys drinkin right now?`\And the dumb fuck too`\I'll take it. Just glad it wasn't a blowout and GS remained competitive til the end.`\Cheers
`\The rest of the games got done, so it wasn't just the Warriors with Perennial Sadness Team in the thread.`\"HIs Mama call him Klay, but Imma call him Klay"`\deeper
`\I think that was obvious to Suns fans. All of our most important players sans Booker and Len have been hurt this year. Also there's been a considerable amount of behind the scenes turmoil. Were not as bad as our record indicates at all.`\http://imgur.com/ueA01r1`\>edit: i can't believe i have to mention that this is sarcasm. holy fuck

I know man. After 3 or 4 years on reddit it still amazes me how awful people are at picking up blatant sarcasm.`\Clarkson is legit. But Randle..damn..he really needs to improve.`\I believe he recently celebrated his birthday, probably multiple times and different clubs. `\fucking Green Kobe was going to dunk that`\lmao that pause

Nice...err....to Barbosa.`\LMFAO`\aaannd the spurs`\fuck off`\Believe it or not but Kawhi isn't playing that much better than Curry even though Curry is on a back to back and having one of his worst games of the season.`\Never gonna learn Danny`\Please no.`\Kawhi rattled Barnes `\So what if silicon valley billionaires weren't attending games back in 2012? How does that make our filling the seats any less legitimate? In Texas do they teach you that only the voice of rich folks count? Would explain your voter id laws.`\Bad all around today for sure. Glad it wasn't my team again, I still have nightmares about the Tor vs. Por game.`\Utah Jazz also play less than 12 hours away from Los Angeles`\Wait, are the girls actually in danger?`\What a great defensive performance...`\I agree but we clearly lacked a big inside presence today. Rebounding with a legit 7 footer and rim protecter will help.

 `\wow are they ever gonna call these digusting illegal screens on gsw?`\I really hope byron was not ok with this win.`\Yup, you're right..Harlan and tucker were goat of goats..man I miss those days..`\End of that game looked like warriors were making it personal. `\He regularly goes 0-8 and 1-7 etc so it all balances out.`\What the hell happened to the Hawks to take them from a 60 win season to this?`\Nah, Philips arena IMO`\fucking A this guys is using cheats #30`\to make things worse, with iguodala out and barnes still recovering, they aren't getting any boards from the 3 either. pretty sure steph has been the second best rebounder on the team since the all star break. `\Yes, because they are both being pressured and double-teamed. Actually, Curry usually has a big man on him on the perimeter due to screens and switches.`\12 points in the fourth so far is unacceptable. Too many bad turnovers and dumb shots. `\This is like when the Raps beat the Bulls in '96.  `\Well it's not for a lack of trying. It seems like every free agency period, they go for the top free agents, they just always seem to strike out. Can't blame cubes on that one, he's no penny pincher when it comes to spending.`\Yes, your butthurt Blazers kept lillard in even though we had scrubs in for the 4th.
`\i am excite `\That music/schedule announcement was annoying as fuck.  Thanks ABC.`\BBQ chicken Curreh`\You said lately. That was what my comment was replying to. If we are talking about compared to last season well the defense is just a hair worse but the overall net rating is better so not a lot to complain about.`\Klay holy shit chill lol. Reminds me of the Key and Peele skit of the dude who doesn't laugh. Laron can't laugh I think.`\The missing players I'll give you, but the splash brothers "sucking" is thanks the Spurs defence. It's quite an insult to the Spurs to not give them credit for that.`\I thought Barbosa played?`\Sure, Steph has a pretty good 3-point shot, but he's no Andrew Bogut.`\you guys played great d...but missing bogs mightve had an effect...his passing and screens help them`\Could the Warriors even beat Kentucky?`\THE BRICK BROTHERS`\Tim "you know you weren't going to do shit"

Steve "bruh I would have rekt him but Blur held me back"`\15 TOs. FUCK!`\Yeah I was baffled by that. There's 8 fucking seconds left! That's plenty of time to make two free throws, foul, and take a timeout to advance the ball. `\He's joking`\I thought I'd never say these words, but what the hell, GO LAKERS.`\Jesus did the Dubs go out partying last night? `\That's not exactly true. People find identity in their fandom and find fan polygamy to be a false representation of that identity. Before national tv your team was your team and it represented your city and community. Yes it is a bit stupid but that can be argued for almost anything. I'm not saying right or wrong. I'm just saying what is socially acceptable.`\3 ball, corner pocket.

I don't think Steph goes 1-11 on 3s in big games. People are all pointing out that the Spurs D caused that. Well the Warriors D caused the Spurs to be pretty mediocre offensively. Honestly warriors lost this be Steph sat out all those minutes in the start of the 4th. Yes he does it every game but only bc kerr is trying to prove that he's not just about chasing the record. But I agree with you, if warriors don't shoot they will lose and I've seen that a number of times over the past 2 years. `\Close 2nd`\That's what happens when you get physical with them.

Why did you bring it up though?`\fair enough, to give you perspective, Hawks didn't get a defensive foul called against them for 17 minutes to start the 2nd half (while we were in the bonus in 5 min to start the game). They shot 24 fts to our 15 (if you don't count 2 hack-a-bogut fta), but we attempted over 100 shots compared to their 70 something..we both shot as many 3s so its not like we didn't attack as much (in fact considering those facts we attacked more). That's just to give you an idea, but you can rewatch the game and decide for yourself if interested.`\I mean..imagine if dray had steph's offensive skill set.. that would just be insane, I wouldn't mind if he kept some of the powers`\Clarkson is back from slump`\i hate myself for missing the first half of this glorious game `\Caught in a landslide.`\Gordon was robbed.`\Man the warriors are cold. `\Fitz is fucking insufferable sometimes`\I love Minnesota's made FT sound.`\DPOY draymond totally shutting down Aldridge. Holding him to only 20 on 50 percent `\problem is, that almost never happens`\Painfully obvious the Dubs gave absolutely zero shits about this game and looked waaaayyy past the Lakers`\lmao warriors getting schooled `\This game made this whole trash season OK`\Fucking go J-lin, do it for the bay, and keep those spurs away from the first seed!`\I know you can handle more than like 7 shots. Now if you can last a whole game... that's impressive.`\Lee just wants to look good in front of his Dubbros`\AG with that 20/16 game.`\Great 2 for 1, finish strong`\Casual MMA fans are the most fickle / bandwagon fans I've ever seen, and I watch about any sport there is.

"My absolute favorite fighter lost?!? What a fucking loser, my new favorite is the guy he lost to."

The cycle repeats.`\lol totally thought Curry's buzzer beater would go in`\Some of it just getting experience and depth. Usually those two are necessities for being a good team.`\Block that shit Danny!`\Fitting that it came from Danny, whom everyone has been shitting on all season.`\damn BS call on #2`\I knew that Warriors have a very solid, great bench. But I really thought that the Spurs will be the ones winning by bench and Warriors winning by starters. Eh, life is strange.`\barnes has been absolute ass most of this season. its like he doesn't even exist on the court anymore`\Ahhh shit! A joke. Okay fine, I'll lower my fists. Don't make me like you. And I won't make you like me either.`\Lol both teams would rip yalls ass`\Holy shit the hype is fucking real man! 2 grear clubs in their peak going at it for a good 4 more years? Yes please!!!

Kawhi is a monster! That's my DPOY`\Well, that's typical for him, right?  Can't score when you're benched.`\Damn expected Hubie to say those old guys are off base to criticize but he ended up throwing shade.`\well when u tank all year and then let your best players play you can really sneak up on ppl`\Game needs more Diaw. He must be fed.`\Is it possible the Warriors and Spurs both lose in the same day? Nahhhhh`\Im so tired of fucking mavs basketball....`\2:30 left...`\Danny Green's D was stellar, he can't run the offense, but in the 3 and D way, I thought he did well this game.`\Kush Klay unfazed`\Exactly at this point Steph isos are better than what we're already doing`\I DON'T KNOW TO PROCESS WHATS HAPPENING`\BLOOD STAINS THE ORACLE'S DOORS

BRICKS OFF THE HANDS OF THE CHEF`\I think so. Reactions too quick.`\There's already gonna be almost 1,000 comments on this thread.`\LOL Mcadoo! WTF`\Towns is real, and he's spectacular.`\Yeah, Spurs defence will do that.`\Basically. They're pretty easy to spot.`\jason caffey ahhh bad memories`\Hubie is just throwing shit at the wall hoping something sticks`\error`\Brush taking a quick rest`\Damn, the net didn't move on that midrange Wes make. `\Dallas has 1 FG in the last... 6 minutes? wtf`\This game is giving me anxiety.`\Hahahaha JVG you god
`\This could be the first loss to a good team the warriors have all season. Leave it to the spurs man...`\Still rooting for the warriors against the spurs, I want their home streak to end `\you weirdo, lol`\and hitting 3's dude i was pretty shocked`\that was an absolutely STUPID cupped dunk. my god. anyone have a replay?`\Because they also like the royals and the Broncos `\Don't. We had a stretch of like 5 fouls in 2 minutes called on us on ticky-tack shit.`\Let's take a point to praise that grab of the ball from Kawhi`\Oh, great, here we go...`\It's absurd how cliche those words are becoming on this sub. It's like self-parody.
`\It doesn't need to be said, but the Wolves big 3 are special, loved watching KAT play today. Also the Wolves TV announcers were fantastic, easily were my favorite away broadcast I've watched all year.

On a different note, it's rare to see the warriors be better with Steph off the court but tonight that was definitely the case. Anyway, terrible refereeing but a good game nonetheless`\Ian needs some stoicism for his shoes with those slippings. `\I am not sure if I'm happier because it's the spurs or because this years finals may not be all golden state sweeping teams to the finals.

http://vignette3.wikia.nocookie.net/halofanon/images/f/f9/Son-i-am-proud.jpg/revision/20101224161625`\Ok, seriously, wtf is going on?`\REFBALL FUCK`\1) you have no ability to guarantee anything

And

2) the 22 points means that one game was close and the other was not hence it is meaningful

And

3) I understand it's possible that leaving the starters in the previous game could have affected the final outcome, but the bottom line is that it doesn't matter since the Spurs elected not to do so`\A security guard just told me he thinks the Spurs deserve this adulation! He was so angry haha.

I wanted to tell him that I love Steph like the rest of them here as well. `\Best team in the league my ass. Maybe it was the magical powers of the Kobe inspired socks`\This has got to be our hottest 1Q in weeks `\Nice move by Ian`\troll post everyone ignore`\Did a jock give you weggies in high school? It's ok. And calling a Texan a redneck. Man, that's new territory in the insult game. So clever and unique. How long did you and your dad take to come up with that jewel?

`\Gs really stepped up their D. We aren't getting any penetration off screens anymore.`\Not happening tonight :/`\Tony has never been a bad defender when he's been healthy. `\Its great to hear my armchair coach strategy get validated. Hound curry for 48 minutes and you'll get him frustrated. If you don't pester him he'll just pull up and drain a 3 and get his team going.`\Steph almost always shows up, it's Klay's streakiness that's the problem :/

`\Wooow`\Ah gotcha, wasn't 100% sure`\[LA LA LA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lb2_WeuvYus)`\Would it be weird if I said I would be more concerned about our chances tomorrow if GSW loses tonight?`\Kawhi the Prince That Was Promised`\Anyone know somewhere I can find a mavs stream? I can't stand the Warriors announcers.`\Stop fouling the shit out of us`\Steph getting hounded constantly, finally gets a call. `\Good call, man. But dark blue is not earth tone though?`\Curry is a superstar that never gets superstar treatment.`\[Nice Shootin'](http://i.imgur.com/aqj9sLL.jpg)`\That phantom call that gave Klay fts probably had something to do with it `\Could the Lakers upset the 95-96 Bulls tho?`\This is what we need to do. Just hammer it down low against these little dudes.`\THE SPURS LOSING IS A SIGN, TWOLVES WIN CONFRIMED `\Don't get me wrong, I think Parker is an integral part of the Spurs, and he should continue to be. But right now, he's the achilles heal on defence. I'd love to see Kawhi take up PG duties in the future, similar to what MJ did with the Bulls.`\You're joking right?`\sticks with it out of the timeout?`\Switch Mo back in, he plays surprisingly good defense.`\[he's been watching Naruto and taking notes on a certain someone](http://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/naruto/images/4/4a/Tsunade_decides_to_head_out.png/revision/latest?cb=20130725124129)`\I don't really follow the NBA much, but I just realized that the warriors have not lost consecutive games all year. Holy shit. Has a team ever gone all season like that?`\You know you can just filter all that mess with RES, right? `\time to rest the starters for orlando`\What a crazy year. Trump winning.

Like, right now.`\Curry was left at the end of the game way longer than necessary, damn near had a heart attack at every drive at the rim. `\They wouldn't t up Kobe on national tv, right?`\BOSA!`\Running through the 6 with his woes! `\Kerr switching up the subs. Curry gets the early rest and Klay plays through the first. `\i hate this man Green but damn`\Chill out dude it's just a game`\He's clutch in playoffs and a good defender, just can't shoot consistently at all`\he's not concerned about fame, he's concerned about greatness... i think`\No, you're on reddit, you have to call him satan`\Not really.`\Aka down vote me cuz I'm salty `\AmA request: God

1.What the fuck?
`\Jack`\Typically these stats have an * for 50 or more games played, or something like that.`\Are they playing their bench? where's curry + klay?`\Reminds me of another australian `\I'm surprised they managed to come out of that half only down 6`\Death, taxes, garbage reffing no matter the sport. `\Curry made a three so with no J I think I could guard you.`\I keep noticing that the audio and the visuals are out of sync. "Puts it in" and then the basket goes in a quarter of a second later or so`\70 million down the drain FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK `\now those two men know how to build a house`\Nobody stops Curry but himself, but I'm sure the Spurs had at least something to do with his poor shooting today.`\Next game is against the Clips. No way he rests with Iggy/Bogut out.`\Well if you get eliminated, you don't really deserve to be called the best. `\Klay ain't gonna shoot 20% every night tho.`\I'm totally down--can your Curry lend some of his powers to our Curry for a little bit?`\Lakers held Curry to 10 points, 4-9 and 1-4 from deep.

WTF LAKERS`\Lakers came to play. If Nate can do it, Lakers can too.`\If you have any form of scoreboard app, the times automatically sync to the time zone your phone is in, so it will be your local time.`\When he completely nailed kawhi in the last few minutes which was a hugely obvious foul and then throws up his hands and spins like a little bitch. I hate him`\Ezeli`\If Mitchell is seriously gonna get a long term contract I wouldn't be surprised if him and KAT fight. Ricky too. They just know how bad his plan is at times. Ricky flat out ignores him which is funny to watch.`\I saw Rubio moving the same direction as Draymond, then grab his arm when Dray extends to make it look like a real push.

But I also don't hate Draymond, so you might see it differently.`\People don't realize this basically only the 2nd year of his career that he's been healthy. That's a problem in itself, but I think it partially explains his inconsistency. He's always been a good FT shooter too.`\Does this mean I can finally go to bed?`\gg lakers, this ome just seems like one of those games for us, but good D too`\The 1995-96 Bulls lost by 32 in their 61st game of the season. Today the Warriors played in their 61st game.`\Spurs fans chanting MVP for Kawhi at the line`\showerthought: Duncan and Diaw are on exact opposite sides of the PF/C spectrum`\draymond complains all the time, yet is one of the biggest floppers in the league `\[Pops: "Just who the hell do you think we are?](http://i.imgur.com/bO7YK70.gifv)

EDIT: Let's see you grit those teeth, Warriors fans`\man good fucking game Dray, truly pulling this team together - out here down 3 key players, everyone gassed....Dray out there winning for us all`\Most likely did not. All the other games got done so they all came to watch this game's final minutes and saw that one call and made their minds up without seeing the rest of the game. It's how users on this sub work.`\That's a loser mentality, Dubs win easy.`\Recreational activities `\> The Warriors are a far superior team to the Mavs

That maybe so, but the last two games you had against us weren't decided until literally the last two minutes. We still had decent chances in both, and last night you beat our bench by 8. A W is a W but if you can't even beat a mediocre bench by at least 15, thats a little concerning.

Especially if your 2 best guys combine for 70 and 73 in those games. `\warrior's can spec tank`\Whenever they aren't called, yep. That's every team though. `\LMA is on fire right now. `\How many are you going to miss Barnes?`\Stupid question - are the sideline ads the same for everyone or are they superimposed for different broadcasters? I'm in San Francisco watching on Comcast and saw ones in Chinese a moment ago.`\The switching tonight was unbelievable`\Wiggins channeled his inner Lavine`\If the Spurs defense shows up like it did tonight its definitely a possibility`\I didn't say Dray didn't back it up, just said he talks shit. When they win, when they lose, he always makes a dig about the opposing team. Which I don't mind, I hate when players are too politically correct. Also if the Clippers don't make it out of the first round, they need to break up the core and hire a competent GM. Doc GM has failed. It would be hilarious if Cp3, Melo, Wade and Lebron join forces because that's their grand scheme to beat the Warriors. I think we'll see more future super teams because of how dominant the warriors are. Do you think Durant is going to the Warriors? `\Have the Lakers been watching nothing but Golden State tapes all season just for this game?`\remember when people thought Draymond was better than Durant......`\are the lakers the only california team to beat the warriors?`\lol Curry the Mummer's Dragon`\whats with these loud ass rims?`\Lmao you can't say the refs are biased yall just got so many calls in a row in those last few minutes. `\I believe so. I was about to make the same comment. Fucking impressive D from the Spurs so far.`\that was good D, bad call`\How else am I supposed to know what shampoo to put in this full thick hair? `\the warriors have been hacking a ton and not getting called for it, espeically when the spurs drive...


and then they called a foul on parker when he didnt even touch curry, never mind the fact that the ref who called it was literally less than 5 feet away`\That's a GSW bandwagon I can hop on.`\6 out of 18? So generally ever since he retired. `\Well what is it, is it nice or is it porn? You implied it was extremely pleasurable for you to watch him fail, which is pretty haterrific.`\The '15-'16 Golden State Warriors `\THERE IT IS`\I AM NOT A ROBOT`\But why is Portland the 6th seed?`\"Friends can come and go, but banners hang forever"`\Seems like lately Mitchell has been making sure atleast one of our keys guys are out there. `\wes is losing us this game. fuck him`\Really? That's the first 3 of the day you make?`\Factoid: Greg Smith has bigger hands than Kawhi Leonard`\the clock is winding down, but my heart is winding up `\We need to get the band back together!`\76-6. Shame the Sixers have 6+ wins already, so no 6-76.`\I believe the Lakers can be better than the warrior for 1 game. You can do it!`\Yup Bogut is the go to guy when we are trailing. `\Houston was like 3-35 the other night`\Marcelo went from Shaqtin MVP to the actual mvp in one game`\Story of the season.`\you need to chill`\To be fair most if not all fan bases do that. And it's not necessarily the same people. Although im sure there's some people being hypocrites `\Honest question.. Why not lop off that fucking mole? It's gross. He's got the money.`\That replay was horrific.`\Tough layup is good..easy klayup...miss`\;)`\Dont care.   GO SPURS GO!!!!`\Or have a fucking coach that uses his best player in crunch time. `\What the fuck Rush that was so dumb.`\Wedgie!`\no foul?`\Spurs have to punish this small line up in the post.  Harrison Barnes is a solid defender but they shoul go at him 100% of the time if he's guarding a post player like Diaw or Aldridge.

This game is definitely an outlier, but I'm ready for everyone to overreact `\Damn Zach.`\Mavs point guards are so bad.`\Everyone on the Spurs were locked in tonight. Danny Green was amazing; Aldridge and Parker were really solid as well. Nothing easy. `\No Dirk, No Parsons and we almost upset. `\Welp.`\Barnes is not getting a max contract with the warriors. He'll take less to stay with them.`\we took phil, we're taking walton too. try and stop us.

in 2 years we're gonna be lakers east`\Yup. We owed him a ridiculous amount. Plus Kaun is just a rookie so he has some untapped potential`\I was thinking more like Manu`\Right?`\Kawhi offensive rebounds were a HUGE difference in this game. Holy shit.`\If it bleeds, you can kill it!`\honestly if yall hit your average 3 pointers this is a the Warriors game. It's not like yall aren't getting good shots.`\Wiggins is too athletic for these guys`\This game is getting a playoff-like intro`\Average age of like 33 for the Spurs bench tonight. Duncan, Ginobili, West, Martin, Miller, Patty.`\Bogut out for precautionary reasons?`\I'm not sure what a foul is anymore `\SWEEP THE LEG`\Steph and Klay 16/27 from 3

That's just stupid`\Lost the game? Booker and Len looked good? Brandon Knight throwing in bombs from downtown?

Not too bad of a night`\I gotta say, even with 55 wins the Warriors are looking so vulnerable. I personally think they need to shake out some winning cobwebs. They are getting satisfied and complacent. Complacency is going to be the number one threat to beating the Bulls' record.

The post-game with Tim Roth and Timmy Tolbert talked briefly about the win. Turnovers. Draymond not looking to score and having 7. Bogut and Steph with 5. But these are things that are nit-picky for a 55 win team, which they admitted.

To me they look vulnerable. I really believe they have to beat the Spurs AT San Antonia and exert some dominance. Break the Spurs' home record. Get home court for the playoffs. Revel in the home court advantage. With that intact, no team can beat them in a 7 game series. As long as everyone is marginally healthy (even restricted minutes) this team can dig out a win on the road and dominate at home. `\Tech on Kerr. Get off the court.`\Statistically it's the biggest upset in the NBA's regular season history
`\I like turtles`\ITT: Warriors fans giving no credit to Spurs defense `\Lol Bogut only got hurt because they decided to have him guard Parsons and Barea on purpose. That kind of thing should only happen in an emergency situation. The injury happened on a Barea perimeter iso with Bogut trying to move his feet and stay in front. There's good switching defense and then there's just pure laziness. Bogut should never switch unless it's between two bigs. Curry should never switch unless it's between two guards...`\socks bro `\DANNY!`\Welp at least I can't be accused of being the only homer in this comment chain.`\Curry :(`\Curry is way off today`\In.

Double standards man. `\shh no tears only dreams now`\I actually think he's pretty good on the ball. Off the ball, he gets in trouble being lazy or getting caught peaking pretty frequently still.`\Is there is a required amount of games for that largest win % differential record? because I'm pretty sure a team thats like 1-0 has lost to a team 0-1 before at the beginning of the season = 100% differential`\Accurate, I must concede. `\you guys have that right? tied at least...you shoot a lot of 3s.`\Tristan Thompson tho?`\GSW's rebounding has been fucking atrocious.`\FUCK THIS SHIT`\Wiggins is going to be a legend.`\welp, was a good game`\You know what you did`\Eat it, bitch`\Please, I STILL root for adonal foyle`\Apparently so!`\Kobes last game against the defending champs?`\Omg, Kerr just flashed a smile at Pop while yelling at the ref and getting a tech.`\Gotta cover that -4.5`\Speights vs Lee, as much defense played as in the ASG.`\Nah, I still got your mom.`\Come on guys, we need to give Steph and Klay our energy so they can use the Spirit Splash! `\He's a great all-around player. In college with the San Diego State Aztecs, he was just a true defensive player with raw offensive skills, but with the Spurs he's more refined which includes his passing. `\Curry is about to check in and start chucking bricks`\Great defense`\They should have won by more than single digits. Way more opportunities to score. Not efficient.`\I called curry going for 41! I'm satisfied as fuck with that`\Not to us or GSW. That's the funny part.`\Lol. This really about to happen?`\Unpopular Puffin: Kinda want to see an 18 point comeback? I mean...as a basketball fan.`\Dont know what the scorers were looking at, that was clearly a lob pass`\https://imgur.com/a/GZZDA`\finals quality game`\Yea like taking away that three Draymond made`\hahaha get shit on. it was hilarious seeing curry clank a 3 to end the game `\Basking in this ESPN post game coverage.`\I wouldn't say I'm happy about a loss, but I'm not mad either. The Spurs are very good and deserved the W.`\This was my first ever NBA game and I had a blast. Highlights: Wolves fans howling during opponents free throws and the crowd going apeshit for the chance at free froyo. Also, Lavine and Towns threw down tonight. I can see the Wolves competing for the 8 seed next year.`\What is this thing we're doing when we don't have the ball?`\So if the Spurs win out and the GSW win all but their match ups with the Spurs, does that mean they will both beat the Bull's record!?`\And that is wrong because?`\Oh God...show mercy Steph...please`\Guess they just had to shake off the jitters.`\That's some sportsmanship right there `\Ticky tack both ways`\Good god, he is so based. Hail Threesus!`\But he is not the bench leader.`\We're missing so many open looks`\'Merica`\(╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻`\Tf. He's keeping them with the lead`\Live by the 3, die by the 3  -Stephen Curry `\Warriors play really well, would be surprised if it didn't go to 6 or 7 Spurs-Warriors series`\Not sure which Warriors team you are watching but standard is about 14-15 a night and not 24. Not only that but the best team in the NBA(Mavs)* Only average 3 less per game(which in the grand scheme of things, is not that much of a difference).

*actually its the Hornets`\No not at all since this team is built to win if curry gets doubled or tripled and gets shut down. Either klay goes off or green and curry just feed the ball to the other 5-6 competent scorers to score enough so their defense gives them the win. They can play any style of ball really, but their only downside is that Iggy, bogut, barbosa are getting old, Barnes can be exploited, speights is only as good as Andrew luck, and curry is fragile. At best i see this current team getting a 3 peat. `\He is overdue and  with pops in the building he is going to be extra focused.`\Oh my God Green! His defense is so fucking good!`\he's the alpha of the pack`\Reddit got taken down by that NFL thread a few months ago. Something like 12k`\FUCKING BARNES`\Man. What a game. Great defense by both sides. `\Yeah honestly, Warriors shot terribly (in large part due to the Spurs defense obviously) and still kept it close. Pretty incredible `\and don't get caught for traveling lmao`\The bench was completely lost without Andre. I'm legitimately concerned about that unit whenever he misses time. They go from decent to awful. `\That's a hard no, sorry Seth. You shall remain in the shadows forever throughout your career. Just remember your enemy isn't your family, it's those mofos down in Los Angeles who are responsible for many  egregious affronts on the human race, such as: Most Reality TV shows, shitty unpaved highways where they make no logical sense so it feels like you're navigating through an area where Michael J. Fox personally hand drew up the blueprints, Orange County - both the place, the TV show, and the awful people it generates who eventually find their way into PHX or NorCal and hella bother everyone with their annoying existence, and of course lest we forget all Michael Bay movies where plots and character development where prioritized at the bottom of the list while explosions, CGI, really fucking awful CGI, and running times over 130 minutes were the primary focused of his bastardization that plague American Cinema.

Someone needs to shut these motherfuckers down for good - and I hereby dub our coalition "The Western Conference Pacific Axis Of Awesome." Where the Phoenix Valley, some guys who still live in Sacramento, and the San Francisco Bay Area team together to make sure that Los Angeles never feels happiness again and that they stay in the basement of the Pacific standings for eternity. **IT IS DECIDED.** `\Ice in my veins!!!'`\He's going to get a foul call everytime`\About to bust out my Kobe jersey and pretend I was rooting for the Lakers the entire time `\Both ways for sure.

Being a female on the rag has to suck.`\This is a damn good game, WCF might be the real finals this year.`\Both teams really good defense, although curry  does seem cold`\LETS FUCKING GO. THE STREAK CONTNUES`\Yeah but is how our team is going to look a couple years from now and it just feels good knowing we can compete.`\The Warriors are no longer a likeable team. `\For how many hibbert coins?`\I hope phil is watching `\I like Clark getting getting non garbage time minutes giving Steph extra rest `\I like you, you're cool.`\GSW fans be trying to neg Barnes into signing for less`\FUCK THE WARRIORS! GO SPURS GO`\Switch all the screens!!!!!1!!!1!!`\salty but the truth`\like and because they actually know things about basketball and aren't insufferable twats, etc`\He hit it out of his hands`\Lol Barkley knows all. Sees all.`\Its so unnecessary. `\Spur's turnovers counteract their good defense on the warriors. This has really been an even defensive game so far`\One of the main reasons i love when the Warriors beat the Clippers is seeing how butt hurt marcellus wiley gets. last couple of time they Ws won he was either "sick" or sportsnation didn't air the day after. `\The Warriors realllllly must have been hung over from last night`\SD would be totally fine! I actually only watch the streams in SD since the internet where I work is so bad.

But of course, do your thing man. We all know you have things to do, but as always, we also all appreciate the work you do for us. `\Prolly Danny. I want Kawhi on Draymond `\It's awful.. that must be horrible to play in. Watching must be shit as well, go to watch basketball and get a concert. =/ `\What salt? Haha`\This will be a hella fun game to go back and look at all the adjustments both coaches made.`\I mean we are still top 5 in def efficiency.  It just doesn't seem like it since we play such a fast pace.`\Just like the 49ers-Seahawks NFC Championship game`\It's only fitting.`\LOL`\MVP.`\Former coach Doug Collins and ESPN's Sage Steele. `\Holy fuck

I swear I heard a fucking popping sound on the stream when that happened. Idk if he hit his hand on the floor or something or if it was his body hitting the hardwood but that was terrible to hear.

`\I think both teams have reasons to be happy about this game's outcome. `\Duncan will play more if they play Bogut.`\Also Huertas is the GOAT Defender. If you had a roster of 12 Huertas's, the opponents would never score a field Goal`\They look really comfy lol`\I mean he wasn't gonna get minutes and he wanted to play and the owners didn't wanna pay him 15 mil to sit on the bench. `\Telling golden state not to shoot 3's is like telling a fish not to swim.`\Its like going home with a chick you thought was out of your league.

So psyched for this match-up - too bad iguadala's out. `\Diaw with magic hands`\Their bench is pretty damn good`\That was quick `\Lol 90% of comments are about the ref's calls. `\I swear I love these Spurs threads. I saw so many comments in the first half telling people to stop bitching about the refs. What's the first thing that happens when calls go against the Spurs? Bitching about the refs.`\Soft ass fouls`\SERIES TIED 1-1 out of 11 games. `\It's easy to see why he plays.

Otherwise the clippers GM looks like an idiot. `\This isn't fair`\Mine said the lakers only had 6 points in the first quarter `\the league finally treating mo sp8s as a legit 3 point threat`\I wouldn't say that.

`\I had my fingers crossed `\Except it is`\As Fitz mentioned in the broadcast, maybe about 6 FTs shouldn't have been called, but even then the discrepancy should still be fairly large. `\How is that not a foul lol, this guy has to be the most bullied and never cares about it and just gets on with it elite player ever.`\The other one gets sent to Africa.`\I dunno I think it's entirely possible that its actually spelled Maurice on his birth certificate and the big yam just never bothered to learn how to spell it properly`\In my opinion, current defenses of the NBA are much softer than those in the past.

You heard it here first. `\disagree, we always hear about worse teams bringing their best effort and just out-hustling the warriors.  but at the same time it is a statistically poor game for them`\Don't think Parsons or Batum would match the strength that Barnes has - he can guard a true 4 effectively, honestly, even if they back him down. Deng's just a bit more solid and stronger is why I used him as an example - but yes, if KD would take less than max obviously you'd want him over Barnes, but in terms of underpaying a player who has the potential to overperform and keep chemistry all together? I'd love to stick with HB and everyone we have now. Don't fix what ain't broke.`\I think it's more about going small. `\After watching 60 kings games this season, it is so refreshing to watch 2 teams play great defense `\fuck da refs mane`\Curry 28/9/9`\It hurts me watch Duncan play less than 10 minutes, take only one shot, really, it's like the end of an era, it makes me feel old`\dagger bros happened..`\More like battle of bricks.

I was just saying that there aren't message games for first round matchups of 1v8 seeds.  If the 1 seed needs a regular season statement game to beat the 8 seed in the playoffs, they don't deserve to be a 1 seed.

And honestly, this game wasn't really that much in the balance down the stretch.  It probably dropped to an 80% GSW win down the stretch.  `\always making history`\I don't mind the slight overpay.

The Spurs played incredible defense tonight, and that's one thing that's going to remain a constant in a playoff series.`\> You gotta admit, the Warriors kinda lucked out with an owner who became poor and sold it to the perfect one. Some fans aren't as lucky as they'll be stuck with inept owners who meddle too much or don't give enough of a crap.

I so agree with you.  When I heard Cohan was selling the team I was so overjoyed and filled with hope that things would get better.  Then we hired the Logo as an adviser and I knew we were heading in the right direction towards a championship.`\Annnnnd it's gone!`\Heh. Kinda funny to see a premier "big-bodied WR look that short.

I'm not necessarily any more confident (although I sort of am I guess), but I'm more excited by the possibility that a playoff series between these two is completely unpredictable. Which is both exciting and terrifying. `\I Love This Game!

What game were you watching?`\Amazing game, today we really can see what a great defensive team looks like! These days we focus on cheering on the offense that we overlook what good defense can do for a team. A truly great eye opener, thanks Spurs.`\He got shut down just like tonight. That's the thing with shooters. They are useless when you put a crazy good defender on them or have a lot of other great shooters/players around him to free up space. Problem is, Spurs have the best defensive team in the league and the 2 best perimeter defenders the league. Crazy. Plus Duncan and Aldridge. They are just ridiculously good on defense. Defense always wins best of 7. I don't see the Warriors beating the Spurs unless they shoot lights out or one of Kawhi/Green get injured. Klay is arguably the second best pure 3 point specislist in the history of the game. Problem is, the moment you contest his shot or make him put the ball on the floor, he's done. Probably the most inconsistent shooter too. `\He made some comments against the clippers though :/`\Lens better `\i can dig yammin, but a yam with a three pointer? what the fuck happened?`\What did you think about the Blazers game when the Warriors got blown out then?

This game was not the all-and-everything since Pop still has some stuff up his sleeve (Kerr of course as well) but a 5 game series I cannot imagine currently. I would say at least 6 games since both teams will win 2 games, no necessarily both at home either. The deliberate loss could be a possibility but it didn't look like that to me, at all. Curry shot the last second shot even, despite it not having mattered. He was not uninterested, at all, but disillusioned with all the hype surrounding him and the Warriors' record.

This loss might serve the Warriors well, however, since they will realize that every Championship takes an incredible amount of energy, effort and luck of course and it is very hard to control many things, such as injuries.

I saw the Spurs play pretty good defense. The refs gave the warriors some drastic breaks with offensive foul calls and the Warriors couldn't hit their shots. The defense was very impressive. The Spurs offense was also very subpar imho. West did nothing f.ex.. So I cannot share your clear cut obvious view. Once more, we will see it in the playoffs and the next 2 games towards the end of the season. Words mean nothing, the truth lies on the hardwood.`\Do the warriors know they don't have to shoot 3s? There's 22 feet of space in front of you go get an easy shot`\This is going to be a huge upset.

He gets a wide open 3 just about every possession he's on the floor.`\can you get the kawhi steal that they called a foul on? (it was his second foul of the 3rd quarter if i recall correctly)`\ahaha DAE fuck the clippers!? xDDD`\Already mentioned it at the start of the game, but cough trap game cough. Also LNJ is so fun to watch`\At this point we just have to finish the season with it`\I think when this was posted before someone said he's actually saying something like "I haven't seen her for a while." Or something like that.`\another no emotion dunk by Kawhi `\I'm upvoting as fast as I can. `\Refs gonna take kawhi out of the game lmao`\Nah I bet I hate them more `\In Curry I Trust`\Great D`\Yeah but a lot of it was caused by good defense. `\I wasn't pointing out the FT disparity as some sort of evidence there was a fix or that the Warriors got hosed.  Clearly there are ways a ref can impact a game for one team if he wants to without calling shooting fouls.  I've just always taken issue with the mindset that the refs are out to fuck over one team.  Obviously they're human and during the course of a game they may make mistakes that lean towards one teams side.  I just don't understand the point of being salty about it after watching a game like tonights `\Getting this tattooed on me one day.`\( ͡~ ͜ʖ ͡°)`\Damn, you're a funny guy.`\We normally play like shit in the 1st quarter. I'd say it's changed in the last few stretch of games post Lakers loss`\I hope the send him a box full of snakes`\Alright sit down Clark...`\Yup, spending two nights in Texas is no man's dream, let alone a group of guys who are teammates. Poor Dubs :(`\not overly interested tbh. I just like watching the madness unfold `\OKC game overlapped, didn't see the first half, will do requests though

People love to play the "bbbbut Draymond held him to 5 points" card when if you had actually watched the last game Aldridge got off to a hot start and had to sit out most of the 1st half because he got into quick foul trouble. By the time he was getting back in the game was already basically out of reach and he ended up only logging like 25 minutes total.`\Aint even worried.

OKC didn't really shit the bed. Durant did hit a 3 to put it up 103-99 in regulation. Yeah he had a dumb TO and foul, but it wasn't like ATL shitting the bed tonight with Shroder's missed FT's and all. Both teams played a beautiful game in OKC. But tonight was pretty ugly. `\Alright kid lol. I'm saying your fans bitched when you lost earlier this year saying it was because Duncan wasn't there.

The Spurs had more turnovers then the Warriors and still beat them, or kawhi's amazing rebounding?`\Listen here man. Look at your comment above. It was meant to ridicule Curry like he's so bad on defense with the one boneheaded mistake. Sure he gave up a lot of 40+ against his head to head matchup. But let's take Westbrook for example. If Curry lit up Westbrook for 3 30+ games, does that make Westbrook a inept defender? No, it's because Curry is such a good scorer that fans and pundits say great offense beats a good defense. Lillard lit up Curry for 51? Sure. I'm also sure you know who Lillard is. Are all opposing PGs who guarded Curry and was lit up by him bad defenders? Not all. `\So do you have sources or are you just saying things..? Cause I can do that too.

He's great.`\Lakers deserve a top 10 spot in all power rankings that come out next week `\A lot of laker fans wan't Whiteside. To be honest, I think we do one of two things depending on where the pick lands. If we get #1 or #2, we can either trade it with clarkson or randle for someone like cousins and go hard at KD, or we sign a horford/whiteside in the offseason and keep the pick. If we lose the pick, we'll go hard at harrison barnes/demar derozan and a big. Regardless in my perfect scenario, next years squad is Russell/Clarkson/Ingram/Randle/Whiteside, although a far fetched "best case scenario" would be Russell/Derozan/Durant/Randle/Cousins. Regardless we can't go anywhere but up and that has me excited. `\GO SPURS GO`\Wow. It's tied? Y'all make it seem like it's a blowout`\I hate moral victories.

Like, I can see where the three point line is just fine without your help, thank you very much.`\This no fun, where's our big men?`\How cute, you think the refs are going to call fouls on the Spurs.`\We can all agree on one thing. The WCF with these two teams will be fucking amazing`\I guess he could be regressing to the mean.

Absolutely gutsy performance by the Warriors tonight undermanned and on a b2b. `\Steph sucked tonight. `\Most teams don't have the overall defense to do this they all try it but eventually fail.

Spurs have one of the best defenders and one of the best defenses of all time. Not only that but they have discipline that most teams don't have. They are built to be able to pull this off.


Edit: I'm not surprised you guys are downvoting but am I wrong?`\I'll have to watch that matchup specifically, but I think thats more because LMA is very good at the type of shots the defense wants to give up, contested mid-range jump shots. Dray is incredible at defense and would be able to decent job in spurts on any player from 1-5 and his hands are incredible.  Iggy is extremely good at what he does also, and can control opposing wings. Both are extremely good at their jobs, but Drays positional versatility makes him a much more indispensable part of their defense than Iggy. Dray also does a whole bunch of stuff on offense also, but thats a different discussion.  `\Klay is the definition of streaky `\Small thing in a game that the Dubs are going to lose regardless, but that was one of the worst examples of officiating I've seen in a while. Dude you're standing there watching the guy pick up his dribble, pivot around, then start dribbling again. It's kind of a basic tenant of the game.`\Klurry`\lol our passing is worse than Man Utds.`\What the fuck refs?`\lol that draymond air ball`\I worry about the Warriors next opponent.

What?`\i'll take 7 games of this`\There wasn't great shooting for sure, but Klay hit the good look or two he got.

Basically, Seahawk fans would often go to other teams' subs after games and congratulate them and say the future is bright and they will be scary next year. Obviously, when you say that to Rams fans, a division rival, you're gonna stir up some drama.

The link above is a Rams fan mocking Seahawk fans after the Rams beat the Seahawks.

EDIT: https://www.reddit.com/r/nfl/comments/2jpuzm/post_game_thread_seattle_seahawks_32_at_st_louis_rams_14/cldz9ab

Added link with another explanation.`\Fuck the Lakers and them getting my hopes up.`\in response to kerr going small`\"I hope you brought chipotle"`\I care`\steph!`\SA!`\LETS GOOOOOOOOOOO`\Dude a win is a win but don't make it seem like the Spurs shut the Warriors down when they were not at 100%

Plus the reason Duncan didn't play was because he wouldn't be able to keep up with the smaller line up of the Warriors since Bogut wasn't going to play. It would have been non stop running that Pop didn't want to put Duncan through.

`\Wiggins learned the ball don't lie tonight`\Lakers gonna get some mad ELO from this game.`\So the rumors were true after all:  It IS possible for Curry to have a horrible game.

Interesting.`\Live by the 3, die by the 3`\Are the warrior announcers serious rn? We're not playing 2 guards because other teams have had success against the Warriors with 2 guards.... we're playing with 2 pg's because Carlisle has played 3 pg lineups all fucking year. Seriously the Warriors announcers are so condescending and passive-aggressive. ".... and you're down by 6"`\just wait and see Steph is gonna drop like 40 on us in the 3rd`\HB!`\Curry so strong he knocked Dirk down lol`\Splash Bros bitches `\Ugly win, but I'll take it.`\Best answer I have heard all night. There are no absolutes. `\Losshington Lizards`\trap game for the Lakers`\If the Warriors were shooting 15% from 3 point and the Lakers kept pulling further and further ahead, why didn't they stop shooting 3 and change their style to maybe a more inside game?`\LMA is a god damn monster`\Shouldn't curry get free throws cuz Livingston got pushed into him while he was shooting? `\yup im happily wrong. hopefully we can get 50% more of our shots falling`\shut up`\1-9 from 3, it's been a rough game for Curry. Thank goodness, his team has helped him out. Kinda like a mulligan to this point of the game`\What a fucking flop!`\Warriors with their classic gritty defense - flop and let the refs continue bailing them out. `\did we watch the same game? Curry didn't just have an off game dude he was absolutely shut down from everyone on the spurs. it is hard to make a shot when you have the length of LMA on you `\incorrect.  Both of Clark's travels were two steps before he dribbled.  Rubio gets a step (essentially establishing a pivot foot) and then another one, but can't move his first foot.  He can leave the spot, but can't land with the ball in his hands.  Euro step, etcs.

`\In 2 games

Edit: lol my b`\Klay struggled with his shooting tonight, but he still came up big in the end. Huge win for the Warriors without Curry and Iguodala. `\u salty bro?`\I wasn't prepared for this`\MCADOOO`\Aw man you guys play The Chain at your arena? Mad respect. `\As a neutral observer, this has been pretty well reffed.

Even when the Warriors were playoff teams the previous 2 seasons, and just last year when the Dubs were a title team, the Lakers still blew them out. Yes, you can say the Warriors aren't focused as usual or the night life is why they lose at LA, but seems reoccurring though. But, this Warriors team is on another level, so they'll be motivated and the Lakers are terrible in the 3rd quarter. But, overall it's a big surprise, but if you have watched the previous seasons, even when the Lakers have been bad the past 3 years.`\LMAOO NANCE `\BLOW IT UP. CURRY TO SAN ANTONIO.`\inexplicable. `\That old school Magic logo next to Dennis Scott, that logo was the coolest, the Magic should go back`\not cool.`\Tough game for the Dubs on a back to back.

Bogut is better than Duncan at this point.

Duncan is relevant to the paint dominance. The Spurs will continue to dominate in the pain even with Bogut and Ezeli.

> Both teams played great defense, but Curry got some good looks that just didnt go in. That doesn't happen often. You can play tight defense on him but that doesn't phase him.

Both teams shot statistically out of the norm both from off nights and solid defense.

> Not only that but his is our 3rd game in 4 nights, including back to back.

This is completely valid.


`\Man Wiggins why

I see this as a strong point, trusting your defense to know how to set up to get the ball back and then letting your push tempo offense to play. sadly Sessions was still in game, which I see as the only mistake, because he hasn't done well at end of quarters. `\Million dollar move, 10 cents finish`\

`\So, if a player plays bad against a team, the other team's win should have an asterisk next to it?

The Spurs played lights out defense for 48 minutes. They did that. And they do it almost every night.

Curry and Klay were ice cold the whole game but it was still a 1 possession game with 2 minutes left.

Your statement makes it seem like when Curry doesn't make his 3's we get murdered. But The Warriors have plenty of other ways to beat you.

He's my franchise PG. Mad respect for this dude for showing up this game and playing his heart out. `\Green is 6'7 and LMA is basically a 7 footer. He's always been more of a finesse player so people tend to forget just how big and physical of a guy he actually is. Green is an excellent player but it's an extremely uphill battle to ask him to guard LMA like that since LMA just physically outclasses him to such a large extent. `\It's like goddamn Bizzaro World where the W's missing all thier 3's and the Lakers have somehow transferred the W's 3 shooting prowless to all their players.`\barkley getting a boner from this game`\There we go Klay`\Sounds good to me.`\Whoever taught Mo the 3 this past offseason should work with Livingston the next`\I didn't mean that at all(though the refs have missed a few).

`\Spurs plz. `\I'm sure they will`\If its not gone, its certainly on hold lol. It's like the 49ers/Seahawks rivalry.

Mo continuously playing impressively.`\I dunno about crunch time, but a few games earlier in the season he looked good defensively.`\I was talking MADDD shit about him in the beginning of the year. I'm glad he turned it around. `\man mavs commentators are terribly biased today`\All the pressure was on San Antonio tonight. It was our Golden State's B game vs Spurs A game. For what the Warriors put out there tonight, I'm not concerned. `\Curry's off ball movement was stagnant tonight. Every switch, a new guy would stick to him whether it was Green, Kawhi, or even LMA. The secondary ball handler would make the correct pass, but the length of Curry's defenders was insane.

Look, I'm not saying that the team needs to hit the panic button and implement a new system.  And you're right about the fact that there's nothing anyone can do about missing wide open shots. But I think it would be beneficial if the coaching staff tried to approach the Spurs' lengthy defense differently `\You raise a good point but there's many factors to consider. Popovich even said this warriors team is one he thinks about alot. That loss the Spurs played their usual brand of basketball. Nothing special. Pop was seeing what the warriors put up so he could implement a game plan.

Look at the other aspects of my post.

Needs to get his stroke back for the real death lineup to be back`\Yea, I didn't see it it was on the edge of the screen, bu I remember the announcer saying Jordna took curry out.   But Curry handled it well, his response? He simply used his arm to create space and somewhat push off, like he did on the corner step-back 3 when jordan was on him.

Refs were pretty bad tho, for both sides.  The bogut foul on jordan was complete bs, when he pulled the chair from under him. A few that we got away with as well.

Jordan got called once all game for having his hand on the player, it was way in the backcourt, when paul got the technical.  `\D.LEE going off just to spite them`\Manu is turning it over on every creative pass he attempts`\I just realized I am still watching the stream 4+ hours later.

Can't see either squad losing at home. `\I don't think Curry has ever talked shit unless someone talks first`\I've gotten over 2013, but 0.4 will never hurt less`\Spurs were humble after game. Manu said the warriors were on a b2b with no Iggy and Bogut and that they would be even harder to beat in the postseason when fully rested. Kawhi said the Dubs just missed open shots. Draymond Green, on the other hand, had to shit talk and was so short with the media. I don't blame him, he's intense but damn, give credit where credit is due.

Who would watch?`\I don't have time right now to go thru specific games but a close game or even a game with a slight lead, it feels like the opposing team expects a flurry of shots from the gsw so they subconsciously stray from their game plan and start takin bad shots, at which point the flurry of 3pts does come and you're sol. Just my armchair analysis anyway.`\Aldridge had a tough time inside still. He made plays to get those points. The gimme stuff was wide open jumpers at 15 feet. Centers don't really do well defending that.

Iggy was probably the guy that really hurt em. `\Dubs' bench can't possibly be this shit most of the time, right?`\Huertas better than Magic? Y/Y?`\What'd I tell ya bout jump shootin teams, Erneh? They ain't winnin' no champ'n'chips.`\No. 0/6 I think`\How the fuck was that not a foul?`\Damn. 65-65 after 3? It's been some kickass defense from both teams. `\It's inconsistent though. If they called it consistently on both ends, there's no reason to get worked up about it. If the refs just let them play this wouldn't be an issue. They draw attention to themselves by impacting the game negatively. `\right?! good game though`\Everything is rimming out for the Lakers!`\Kobe with that D`\how did anyone not see this coming

Not necessary to list injured players. `\No you are wrong. The Spurs were held to 87 because the pace was way low that game, not because we had incredible defense. Klay's a great SG defender, but centers are far more important for team defense. We were getting abused on the glass by the Spurs all game without them. And Aldridge went off when we only had Dray at center. Dray defends him by denying him positioning and the ball, but if he also has to help on the drives, it allows Aldridge to recieve the ball nearer to the basket where he can use his size to score easily. You don't even need that good of a defensive center to prevent this, you just need somebody that can help on drives so Dray can stay on Aldridge.`\No Iggy either`\were gonna get half our bandwagon back for a few days`\This is basketball excellence right here ladies and gentlemen

We need a Center. Al Horford is not the answer. We get the absolute dogshit beaten out of us on the boards night in and night out all the time and it's never going to change. I love Al. He's a great player, would be a great Power Forward for anyone else in the NBA anywhere else in the NBA. But not here.

Millsap has taken over at the 4. He's great for us all game long until that final minute and then just...fucking hell I don't even know. Chase a big man in the off-season. Get us a dominant rim protector and a dominant rebounder. Chase D12. Chase Whiteside. I don't even give a shit at this point just get SOMEBODY.

17 offensive rebounds is unfuckingacceptable by any margin.`\Randle can be so sloppy`\[Sure](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEMVGHoenXM)`\I actually love that. I know the 80s Lakers/Celtics and 90s Bulls brought a ton of fans to the game, and I think that the most iconic teams have that in common.

Not really sure what we did to adjust other than play Mo and McAdoo since they can score around the basket.`\I don't think any serious fans think this. It's great to see Rush able to contribute again.

YOU HIT SOMETHING!`\Kudos to Spurs. Some team finally played defense the way it should be played against Curry. Tight defense all night with no breathing room and everyone gave 100% effort. I just noticed that other teams gave him way too much space and don't even put effort on defending him. Hope all the other teams can also play this kind of defense on Curry.`\And the Spurs knew screens were coming so they started a lot of times with Parker on Curry. Really brilliant basketball on both sides tonight. `\Most likely.

Wiggins should be a SF. We wouldn't have signed Aminu most likely (or would have him off the bench).`\Surround him with great players, he can be.`\Casual`\Cp and Jj have gone cold, they basically propped the team up without Blake. Also the bench has reverted back to ISO shit ball`\It also helps when you can just pressure your man.

I'm so happy.`\DEFENSE, not off night`\Rubio, despite the early turnovers, was magnificent again. So tough and smart. One of the most underrated players in the NBA (not here, of course, but elsewhere).

KAT and Rubio are going to be the ones who take the Wolves places. Lavine and Wiggins are a tier below. The Wolves now need a coach that understands developing KAT in these late game situations is the way to go.`\Nah, of course not.  Would just be a sinister stroke of irony is all.`\and Mo single handedly saved us. `\They've knocked Steph off his rhythm, gotta build a lead right now, no guarantee this keeps up after halftime`\I don't know how you can even say that. The guy never does anything bad. `\LMA was a workhorse on OR's`\Because injuries and back to back games are illegal in the NBA right?`\clusterfuck?
`\size wise too`\But when the sample size is literally thousands of games, your complaint sort of breaks down. Also all time percentages don't even matter anyway.

This comment is totally not trying to downplay my embarrassment of my realization that I'm a fucking idiot.`\Very possible`\....what are u talking about???`\OMG. I am dead.

Lakers is gonna get the 8th seed and sweep the Warriors in the first round`\I'M WORRIED. `\Now all we have to do is score every time down the floor for 7 minutes
`\inb4 "they have scored the same amount of points"`\Perfect opportunity with LMA out, dubs can take a decent lead`\Holy crap we did it. `\missing three of their players on a back to back on the road. lets not go nuts`\Forgot to deflate the balls tonight.

If you don't routinely get your ass handed to you in practice it's tough to become a top tier fighter, and getting your ass beat by black-belt level experts humbles you pretty quickly. Guys like Diaz, McGregor, and Sonnen are outliers.`\Lmao. Fuck off you loser!`\100% is 2.17 times as good as 46%. Steph's best attribute is 3 point shooting.

In most games if we hang in there, usually Curry sparks one his 8-0 runs, but with the Spurs I just don't know. `\I like Varejao but I think it's tough to join a team like the Warriors and instantly fall into place. He'll get better and better the more he learns the Warriors' system/plays. And by learns I mean knows them all without having to think, not just that he knows them on paper.

This is true for any team of course, but the Warriors really drill passing/screening/etc. to another level compared to most teams, takes time to do. `\Man, Steph seems really sad :( Shit... Don't be sad, Steph.`\Yeah. Despite how good our defense was tonight, it doesn't exactly make me super optimistic for a playoff series. I don't expect Curry or Klay really to shoot like that again. Add in the injuries and fatigue and it makes me nervous. That being said, there's room for improvement from the Spurs too. Kawhi wasn't great offensively and we turned it over a lot. Also it wasn't like it was just a bad shooting night for the Warriors. We certainly did a lot to disrupt their offense and did a great job chasing Steph all night. `\Me too... that's great.`\Never again`\Huertas was fucking MVP this game. Dude made some beautiful passes and actually played some decent 1v1 defense.`\Warriors shot from 3 the way the Rockets have been shooting the last 2 games.`\I think it's if they win and score over 100 for the game. `\thank you both`\I think it was more to get another possession to the mavs in the final minute and hope that he missed so it was worth it`\Really? It looks shitty to me.`\They ruled that a legitimate call bro`\Can the watch ESPN people PLEASE choose some different commercials?!`\Wow, really? But it's rated M!`\Oh hahaha.

`\Andrew BoGOAT`\I'm pretty sure nobody ever actually thought that.  The media just needed to find something to say about the Warriors that wasn't just dick sucking when they had the chance so they could feel like they had a "fresh new angle".

i actually believe timmy is too slow for this particular matchup`\Never again.`\are they hungover or something? i bet they had a hell of a party yesterday`\Pretty solid breakdown of the young guys. JC/ DLO can be an absolutely dynamic offensive pairing; we got away from it as the game went on (Scott going for the win... ironically that probably only hurt us), but even in our broken down mess that we call Motion Weak, JC/ DLO look great as dual playmakers who can both shoot the 3, make the pass, make the midrange, shoot floaters, and get to the basket.

Defensively they were much more active and engaged than they usually are, but it's nice to see where they are at when they're putting in the work. Still a little concerned about forcing DLO to guard bigger 2s like Klay  instead of letting him use his length advantage at the 1 (JC doesn't have the reach or strength to guard 2s).

Randle absolutely needs a jump shot though. I heard they might not rework his jump shot from scratch which is terrifying. We need Chip Engelland...`\Can the Lakers cut Huertas please?

If we are talking about this history, it's likely to be impossible.`\One of the best games by far this season. GG Suns, you guys have some excellent young players.`\I knew it. Last time Detroit was honoring Big Ben and they blew us out. I knew it when I heard about the Kobe socks today...`\thompson's shot is so pretty`\is that assist or rebound?`\Ahahahahahahahahahaha`\Yo why is Barnes getting so many touches...`\Fair weather fans downvoting everyone. Heat jerseys in ALL their closets.`\klay. wtf`\This works in twitch chat Kappa`\Not funny anymore, Warriors. Can't tease me like that.`\Well that movie looks awful`\You might be confusing me with a Spurs fan. You see we still rocked the Oracle when our teams sucked. Not sure current Spurs fans know that their franchise was a round before Duncan.`\He's in there to blunder away the game obvi`\This isn't even our final form`\I just want all these teams that are tanking to give me a game where I can just lean back comfortably and not get any closer to the tv`\It's easy enough to type with one hand.`\Now THAT I can get behind. `\I'm loving this haha. Warriros getting exposed `\True, but I think its more important to get LA going early though.`\When Mo Speights starts hitting 15 foot turnarounds...`\Yeah we're gonna get health problems.`\Shaun's Defense is pretty underrated. Dude's been playing great as of late.`\Barrea vs Thompson. wow.`\Moments to be cherished. `\he grabbed his arm and stole it.

then mills gets called under the basket? seriously?

foul on Gino? come on that was ridiculous

and1 when both are going for a rebound? ridiculous`\Nope, there was one earlier this week`\Looks like he pulled his ankle evertors a bit. `\I certainly wouldn't!`\Thunder was stupid af at the end of that game`\http://i.imgur.com/1fLMxhP.gifv`\Missed the whole game except the last few minutes, how did everyone play? `\He has lobbed some passes over a tremendous distance, and is usually quite accurate. We're talking coast-to-coast passes`\This is first game I'm gonna see live came all the way from NZ to see Kobe. It's surreal seeing these guys in person `\Klay so inconsistent its inconceivable`\Media will say he was passing for the assist `\Best Sunday showcase ever!`\This telecast needs more 'Bang' tbh `\warriors are 54-0 on games they lead at the half`\"You said S my C"`\I don't even...

Now it's you guys. `\livingston is money from midrange`\Great win. Can't expect Steph to shoot that poorly again though. Can't wait for April 7.`\you mean Ezeli.`\There all just Curry fans! They will eventually come back where they belong but yea it was insane having like 15 mavericks fans in my section and the rest be dub fans.`\Nahh fam I'm stuck at their game right now. We're winning by 49 I think we're good `\You fucking dismantled the best team in the league`\lol flop`\80% 3 pointer shooting lol`\Barea sounds like he is being raped when he flops`\proud of us hanging around`\rly?`\You don't realize how bad LaVine was for most of last year. Yeah he's grown but to say he's done it on his own is pretty idiotic.`\Damn 1 win away from being **60-6**

Fucking insane`\Are you talking about the one Pop barely even used against us? Pop knows Duncan can't play heavy minutes against the Warriors`\Wow Atlanta, just wow...`\http://i.imgur.com/EZcn2QV.gif`\Clarkson damn`\This is the only time I'm rooting for the Lakers... GO LAKERS lmao`\I hate that I thought of this, but I think the Wolves would be a great fit for Harrison Barnes. Can play great D on 2-4 and shoots the 3 well, plus he'd get more opportunities on offense if thats what he's looking for.`\hahahaha klay with the pass to the cameraman`\Their small ball lineup got exposed by LMA inside`\We usually have to pipe in the atmosphere`\You gotta appreciate the refs' ability to do a shitty job for both teams, day in day out`\calling /u/stephcurryisgay

It's quite funny tbh.`\Really happy that Barnes is playing himself out of a max bar a great playoffs for him, lets us keep him for under max and hopefully tap into that potential.`\Clear makeup call

Are you that bitter that you can't let a 12 year old root for a team he enjoys watching?`\They'd rather be 63-6 I bet`\Curry them.`\Justifiably so, the most exciting part of the game!`\I don't know if the better team won tonight lol. Klay slipping and getting a call, Bogut shove, Livingston mauling Horford and no call, Schroeder And-1 miss, Klay drive near the end of regulation for a phantom call.

I went in just wanting to see a good game and I ended up cheering for Atlanta because of the bad officiating going against them of that magnitude lol. `\Lmao did someone on GS fall for no reason `\BDL`\Klay remembers all the double teams from last game. He never forgets`\should be Go**LLLLLLL**den state **WWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW**arriors`\Not with 2 timeouts left`\that seems like unecessary anger. lol he really wanted that T`\It's  been a recent thing and it's real annoying.`\No WE did

I like it. `\Gotta love that Livingston mid-range bread and butter.`\Miss u Andy :(`\That's what happens when you're a 45% 3pt shooter. `\Pop said "Kawhi doesn't care about fame, he cares about greatness" I think.`\And the arena looked half empty. `\Uh that's good news?`\hahaha fuck yeah`\It's time for our savior, Mo Buckets to unleash hell.`\By not drafting him, twice.`\All fans are no matter their flair`\Wolves starters goin ham`\We cannot grab a rebound. `\Exactly. Injuries are a good excuse. What part was confusing?`\Thank god you threw in the /s`\Okay, that was tough. I feel like this could have been the game to turn the corner for us in terms of momentum, but it didn't turn out that way. Even this depleted Warriors team is pretty good.`\CRABOGUT`\Welcome to our season.  `\:(`\False statements are always correct, good sir.`\I feel sorry for the Warriors' next opponent. Oh well, back to March Madness!`\Danny Green is the God of transition defense`\We got this`\Yes, the calls this quarter have all been questionable. `\LOL the one time I'm rooting for Lakers. This is great hahahaha`\The three point line lighting up is really fucking annoying `\umm that was a foul`\Warriors cannot afford to rest Green and Thompson when Danny Green, Duncan, Diaw, Mills and Manu are out there....dang I forgot how deep we are lol`\Travel?`\Barnes is too good of a player not to receive max offers this summer. It's weird because people tend to overrate Warriors' players yet Barnes is under the radar.`\Also, the block, steals, and turnovers columns are messed up.`\Ron Artest. Goat!`\those bigs, you're likely referring to Amir and Sully right? Those bigs have better defensive numbers than Lee and that was the breaking point for Stevens, if you cant d up, you better have a crazy offensive arsenal which is why he has given IT4 the keys to the backcourt`\Oh shit JC nice :O`\Yooo haha this too real`\I'm going to stick with German Sport Gun.`\Definitely a foul. Livingston should have been at the line, however. `\I think this game has exhausted my love of basketball for a few days; just pure painful.

Too many clanks, too many turnovers, too many fouls- *shudder*`\What about them? Aldridge was playing and played very well. Bogut is an elite rim protector and we tend to struggle a lot more when he's not playing.  `\That was after the asg too. `\That's a makeup call for lots of missed calls vs the Lakers`\What an amazing game. Swaggy P and Huertas had excellent games. `\Flair up`\Must be the churros`\33-8 in Bench Points? Geez, that's how Golden State can take over this game. `\http://i.imgur.com/USYhxtz.jpg`\Pretty sure, yup. `\LeSalt Blames.`\I couldn't believe that "drive" of his actually led to a bucket. `\Were they whistling on the post game show a few minutes ago? I just moved into a very old house 2 days ago and I heard something whistle a fucking tune, Im freaking out`\The Spurs definitely beat them dude there's a reason steph went 1-12 you have to give at least some credit to the defense. They're historically great for sure but that doesn't mean they're unbeatable. Should be a great WCF `\Klay was guarding a Jordan Clarkson who had already picked up his dribble yet it looked questionable whether Klay actually touched the ball as Clarkson just took off while seeming to commit a double dribble and went to the hole for a easy dunk.

Steve said fuck it and walked on the floor complaining. I could understand his frustration as that shit was warranted cause it looked like a double dribble to me but whatever, I don't have a whistle. `\GET FUCKED!`\I'm just saying we should drive on every play.`\The red rocket was out retard `\lol just gonna say how that was a nice save from a back court violation by green...`\Doesn't matter.  As they said on the broadcast, Curry's made those shots with the great D.  He was just off, and Thomson was just off.  `\Remember when the DUBS blew out the Spurs in Janurary and everybody thought it was a wrap? LOL`\Fuck is this officiating????`\He makes a lot of young mistakes. Gets too hyped sometimes in close games. Or overconfident when the offense has been stagnant. Fixable stuff. Hasn't seen many close/meaningful games in his career.`\We can't keep getting away with this...`\Ow. Right in the childhood. `\Owen. `\Probably not. 4 wins up on the 6ers, 4 wins behind the suns. Looking more and more like we are locking up #2`\=')`\Steph and Klay have turned into November 2014 Kemba Walker + Lance Stephenson`\How was it clear? Thompson may have touched the ball.`\Russell `\SD would be just fine. I Always appreciate you hardwork man.`\Huertas got them lock ups you already know`\62-6 but yeah we must be doing this wrong all along`\I feel extremely confident right now.`\minny getting all the calls`\Calling a time out at 69 all, real mature there Steve Kerr`\Well, these two teams respect the hell out of each other and see each other as the primary threat to a title. `\I almost always like JVG, but listening to him suck Golden State's dick after they lost really pissed me off`\SPLASH BROS? MORE LIKE TRASH BROS!!`\Yeah it's just sort of funny to think about. In reality he'll likely stay in OKC with Russ because they seem to love playing together.`\Fucking basic ass players smh `\Then Kerr knows Bogut can't play heavy minutes against the Spurs.

And when that happens, we dominate the boards.`\You'd think klay would light it up here every time since he grew up shooting in this stadium `\SWAGGY`\http://i.imgur.com/RbQcbTH.jpg`\I love that these two treat it as a gentleman's competition.`\Goddamn that slam was fresh`\Never again. `\wow so glad i decided to watch that game. so fun seeing teams (especially young teams like the suns) go after the warriors every night. also now that ive watched im 1000% on the booker bandwagon.
`\LMAO`\what is happening guys? Are we all just simultaneously dreaming of the Lakers beating the Warriors?`\we're a hot mess `\Steph's buzzer beater STILL not on /r/nba?!?! where's the streamable?!`\Huh, what? I haven't noticed that. It's just you dude. `\Warriors can't handle that D baby!`\How are you posting this? You can watch it on whatever it is at the least.`\The call in the first half was correct. HAHA.`\Good luck with the MCAT!`\What?.. I mean the weird fouls on Kahwi lol.. `\It would be so fucking sad if we lost the last game of the season`\Rockets and Clips lose same day.
I love it.`\(hopefully they do)`\Seriously. I was watching the game on a slight delay (shout out to my 9 month old) and had the game blown by bleacher report and the physical difference my body went through when I knew we won was amazing. It felt like a Xanax just kicked in.`\We have a team option I believe, If we don't resign him we can say 2 Max contracts this summer and 1 the following`\This is the script to a movie`\This is too much of an accurate comment. `\Woooooo`\I like Brick Brothers.`\Don't do Kobe like that man they won`\You don't have to resort to insulting people, pull your head in.`\The shot of the refs had me rolling`\http://i.imgur.com/hDFOX7W.gifv`\Pregame ritual maybe.`\But what did he do against them today?`\why?`\terrible shooting from GS and the lakers showed up`\Salty warriors in this thread lol`\Oh, shot clock is low? No problem. Fucking bobo ice cold`\Yeah? What's your point?`\Why not tho`\Well, the bench is in. It was fun while it lasted, chaps.`\Lol, Spurs couldn't get any luckier with these bounces.`\DJ Quake takes requests during the game. You should tweet at him. `\and lost`\Since he is still under contract I dont see any reason as to why he could refuse. Hes an interim head coach. Pretty sure thats legitimately his job title lol`\they didn't call any defensive fouls on the hawks for the whole 2nd half till 4--5 mins left of the 4th quarter`\ew. `\Nance was a steal at 27 (?)`\HUERTAS`\> disingenuous

I have never seen this word used more than I have on Reddit. Not only that, but I never see "ingenuous" used, like ever.

And the comment you're replying to wasn't even disingenuous. He's saying that by performing worse than average(which they did), they will likely regress to the mean, which they probably will. `\Holy shit, Marreese Speights won a rebounding battle.`\I'm having a crisis right here, I might regret this tomorrow but fuck it lmao`\oh come on don't blow it`\You could say Golden State was actually *Stephortless* this game`\McGregor, Holly Holm and GSW lost in a span of 2 days. Wow.`\When Curry has almost as many 3's as the entire Timberwolves team`\Say hi to PawPaw.`\If you push a guy into a guy shooting then are you fouling the guy you're pushing or fouling the guy shooting by using a human as an object, I'm confused?`\Varejao is good for a tumble to the deck every gamw`\Damn, I was wrong. I thought GSW would blow out the Spurs, but you proved me wrong. GJ Spurs`\You have no practice you'll probably F it up.`\#HIGH ENERGY COMMENT RIGHT HERE`\And then have Danny green foul him 3 times in the next 5 seconds.`\Draymond ain't human. `\What did he do? `\Let's supply this man. `\The 3 free throws were pretty high percentage shots, though.`\He missed everything short tonight.  He missed a 3 where he took a dribble and stood there for 3 seconds.`\Who would ever do something like that?`\Curry on his own please. It will be painful, but it's justice.`\Lakers dropping to the 4th pick with this W`\I missed it, why was the 3 taken away?`\Great block on Curry, then a little bit after he misses an open corner 3.`\They're going at Parker's crap defense, put Mills in `\Ankle and the knee, dude is a warrior though.`\Man I hate playing in San Antonio but still, if we can be down Dre, Bogut, and Ezeli, play that fucking horribly, and still be in it til the very end...we'll be aight`\The Los Angeles Lakers scored more points than the Golden State Warriors in the first half of a national basketball association game.`\I never stated the Spurs have an advantage. I think it is a close matchup.

And i love how you bring up the +22 again when your last comment was "its funny that you latched on the +22 thing." You don't know wtf you're talking about so it's okay `\This guy reps a rockets flair on our sub`\well it's half trill`\Can't wait for screaming Spurs lady.`\HERE WE GO, BOYS.`\Kappa`\Get Barnes the fuck out of there.`\Once again asking for a stream, ESPN won't let me log in either, need to see this.`\I'm not getting any of those, just acura commercials over and over.`\Anything is possible!!!`\Obviously a foul on that 3`\Lakers sleepwalking right now`\Clarkson balled out, what a game.`\lol whats more impressive, 32 straight losses (reg. only), or 43 game win streak at home..?`\Worse then Bairstow`\Steph just need 1 reb for triple double`\that was some cute hand holding`\GO SPURS GO!

SF: KD

It's chaos whenever the best teams lose`\I can watch 7 games of that kind of basketball this May.`\Man I don't know how the Warriors keep pulling these lucky wins out of their ass but it's amazing. `\dae gs being wxposed!!!??`\Weak foul ref`\So underrated, although I suspect the vets didn't really stay out late last night `\what an entertaining game so far`\I think he thought Patty was going to be in the corner.`\Dirk putting a hole in the wall after the Dubs took the series will always be one of my fondest memories.`\why didnt they take a timeout`\He's been shafted towards a position he usually doesn't play, but still does a pretty damn good job despite this.  I hope when Byron Scott gets his ass fired and Hibbert is back to being a great defensive asset (or we get a defending center better for us, I like Hibbert and would hope he gets better over the years), he will unleash more beastliness at the Power Forward position.`\Still no D'Angelo`\No he was just young and embarrassed. I doubt it's on youtube, but some WSU fan somewhere has a video of it I'm sure. It was heartfelt. Like we were watching him grow up before our eyes. `\Now we tied...never mind `\no, just no`\It's very likely the defense got in his head and threw him off focus`\:]`\Please, no iggy no bogut no festus. This isn't even close `\Yeah I just saw it again and he did say that. It actually makes sense this way because he was flustered. Barely could tell JB that he has to go. Like a school girl who saw Beiber.`\Great effort all around! `\IT BLEEDS`\Hopefully see this again in the western conference finals.`\Nice retirement present for Kobe`\i have a question about how the 3 more till he's suspended works. Does it reset during the playoffs? If not wouldn't it make more sense for him to pick up 3 now and have to sit out a game during regular season vs having to sit out a game during the playoffs, cuz he'll definitely get techs in the playoffs where the emotions are way higher`\Fuck`\Goddamn it, missed free throws have been destroying the Dubs tonight... `\That stop on a dime and fade over Millsap was clutch as fuck`\That showtime fastbreak was unbelievable, are you kidding me Huertas???`\Calm down`\He shoots outside shots more than driving to the cup.

`\wow.. mavs just watching as steph dance to the rim.`\Don't tell that to all the Wardell nuthuggers.`\He was guarded that way nearly all season, Spurs did bring that extra intensity. Off night? Yes. Good d by spurs? Hell ye.`\To be fair, that was a sexy ass play`\I don't know guys. Whenever I go out for some special occasion and miss the game the dubs lose. (Friends birthday X 2, comedy show, wedding, company Christmas party... Can't remember last one). Anyway, I've got a back to back Friday and Saturday (The French Laundry dinner and a wedding) coinciding with the mavs and Spurs games. I've gotta bad feeling about this. `\Man this has trap game all over it if we don't pick up our play`\I agree with you`\don't hate him. it's not worth it. he lives his punishment everyday, going home to iggy azalea.`\Well, we just don't know that.`\Fuck this joke and its variations on this sub, seriously `\Curry is playing shit offense while being defended by Smith. 50/50`\Just an ESPN thing. I believe it's the same company behind the yellow first down line in football.`\@GSW We Gon B Alright!! \o/  (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻`\I really wanted that win for our team but I'm so so proud of how we played. `\1. And Ezeli. Top two C's and our sixth man. Shit happens.
2. Held, wrapped up, and the Spurs were shoving screeners into him when he shot (saw them do that at least four times). But hey, the refs were allowing tons of physical play.
3. Matters more when you're short-handed and every metric shows that teams on the back end lose more than they win.

And the Dubs lost a close game with those prevailing SA advantages. I think it was a scrappy showing and I don't think the Warriors lose to this club again this year. And if they do, I'm just wrong.`\duh`\Fuck those officials, teams shouldn't have to guess what is gona be called on a nightly basis, it really detracts from otherwise great games.

Good game Atlanta, shame the refs were so inconsistent for both sides.`\Yeah`\fan polygamy. yuck`\This game is pretty much what happens when I play 2k. I have to play the Warriors with the lakers every time and I still manage to win or make it very competitive `\Danny Green Defense: **YES!!**

I apologize on her behalf. I married an idiot. `\that's why we getting beat up?`\Saw the score, put on league pass thinking I'd get to see a close game in the 4th quarter. It's halftime. What the fuck is going on`\We don't care if you're into butt stuff. `\Damn man I couldn't see the game and I was about to post dubs flair, anti dubs comment, karma again. But you took it one step further with dubs flair, fake anti dubs comment, double karma. Hats off to you. `\Nah it's lost that flair for me because the Niners are a completely different roster.

Too bad we don't bore neutrals like you guys and have the worst TV ratings of any championship team.`\His on ball defense is great.. His off ball defense is lacking.. `\No, because he doesn't get superstar calls.`\hey`\My body is ready. `\This game deserves an Our Curry


Our Curry, who arts in splashing,

Hallowed be thy 3,

Thy Draymond come,

Thy will be wet, at Roaracle and on road trips,

Give us this trey our daily lead,

And forgive us for our poor passes,

As we forgive those who poor pass against us,

And lead us only by a few points,

only to be delivered by Threesus.

This year? Yes`\With how poor the Dubs were shooting, it was obvious Curry needed time to adjust. Lucky he got 52+ minutes to figure it out.`\Yep, same happens with the Rams.

But seriously, the Dubs play outside-in. Because Curry can pull up from 40, he (and to a lesser extent Thompson and 'em) can space the floor in such a way that the paint is wide open for someone to lay it up. `\Jesus. I feel bad for Hawks fans.`\obligatory never again `\We are the best team in the league! That's what's going on `\cmon refs`\It looks like Spurs going to be demoralized.

It's not THAT bad.`\2005, but yeah, that series was amazing`\Yup. Fat contract too. Holding out hope he comes out better next season after another off season of rest. `\how about Danny Green with the DEFENSE!!!!`\I think Doc may have wanted to keep Paul off Curry so he isn't burnt out because Paul had to carry the offensive load.  In the past when Blake played, Paul would do his best to aggresively hound Curry, then just default to Blake on offense.  That's my best guess at it.

Lol...`\Turnovers, the Spurs have turned it over 16 times.

Fouls, the Spurs have committed some silly fouls, particularly Ginobili's two in the 3rd quarter.

Draymond Green, he's got 7 assists and 8 rebounds to go with 11 points.

Point reduction, Aldridge and Leonard, who were superb, have cooled off in the 3rd.

Officiating, some controversial calls have occurred in the  2nd and 3rd quarters.

Defense, both defenses have been a smothering fire, reducing the scoring.`\They lead now.`\Curry was 2/9 behind the arc.

Warriors have their best game, Spurs have their worst. Warriors win by 30.

Spurs have a bad game offensively but lock down the Warriors, Spurs win a close one.

Your comparison just isn't valid. `\[Steve Kerr was angry about what he thought was a travel](http://www.cbssports.com/nba/eye-on-basketball/25524132/steve-kerr-jokes-that-traveling-is-now-allowed-in-the-nba-silly-me) and said he didn't know traveling was allowed in the NBA now.

EDIT: Autocorect changed Steph to Stephanie, I'm leaving it.`\Most boring game of the year, lol gonna be 30-30 at halftime`\Still close for how much the Warriors have missed, I'm not gonna relax till the clock strikes 0`\I still can't believe he hit that 3 the other day. `\You're saying this when he's played great defense on fucking curry the last 3 possessions. `\Super star curry calls!`\I'm really counting on Smitch to give us this win here. Pls`\You mean like on the set?`\He's teething.`\Oscar Robertson is right /s`\i like you....`\Yeah I thought he was average tbh, no worse than CP3`\They already gave them the loss lmao. Eyyyyyyyy`\Breaks down our defense better and use the guards to just run at three point shooters.

e: Although some teams just switched everything and just accepted mismatches on their guards on defense`\FUCKING REBOUND`\$300. The day turned out real nice haha`\This guy knows whats up`\huertas playing the game of his life. soo many dimes today.`\Definitely. Pretending the Lakers are good and Warriors are bad isn't really funny. Like at all`\They've actually added that since they started the "Showcase" product (with the light up 3s and shit). For reference you could check the SAS@CLE game, where they did an awful job of it and resulted in echo.`\HOLY SHIT! How do you know I do pushups during Spurs games????`\Quit Bricking 3's!`\is Timmy not playing?`\Never forget Ron with the "No No No Yesssss 3"`\Bury them!`\Should've listen to Kanye.. "No more parties in LA"`\Spurs vs Dubs vs Refs vs The off button on my remote`\I think some lotto team may max Barnes to fuck the Warriors like Philly or the Suns`\ZARBAAAAAAAAAAAA!!!!`\Sometimes they both *don't* show up too!

^^^1-18 `\They really didn't play good defense. Unforced errors were king for the warriors today.`\wow, really sac? just gonna go bad on your norcal neighbors?`\Gsw played like horse shit. 1-18 from 3 if i remember and like 15+ turnovers if I remember correctly. `\http://i.imgur.com/1F4QL1x.gif`\Fucking hell, I'm at work and all I want to do now is watch this game. `\Patty Mills loves playing the Warriors.`\I hope Golden State has learned that San Antonio has just lost. Maybe that will light a fire under them, and I'll come out the second half not screwing around. Defense has left much to be desired so far.`\because it should be more without the help of a shitty call for steph and a complete no call on leonard`\Still sooo much time left in Warriors-time`\This may be the best comment of the night`\The evil in me loves this game.

Also the rest of me too.`\All this game needed was some Boban`\*shudder*`\Ball don't lie`\When I see these fucking kids sitting courtside I just think, damn, I didn't even have cable growing up.  Had to fucking move the antenna around just to get basic channels.`\> ITT

In this sub`\I agree with you, but this isn't the place and it's a never-ending, unprovable argument. `\"Not really"`\That song was Pass Out by Tinie Tempah I believe`\gonna need a gif of steph and KAT holding hands. `\i mean, okay.`\That thread was awful. I don't know why I spend time on this sub. `\Lol k. Sorry for pointing out something idiotic you said.

 I love how you don't even acknowledge that Tim Duncan didn't really play last night.

As a non warriors or Spurs fan, at least I can look at the matchup objectively. Go bet on the Warriors and screenshot it for me if you're so confident. I already know you won't. Warriors fans (the fake bandwagon ones) are all talk. I guarantee you won't be a warriors fan once curry isn't there anymore`\Damn Clarkson is competitive as fuck.`\LAWLERS LAW`\Yea it's been rough. Curry was 1-9 I think and Thompson didn't hit a single 3.`\http://i.imgur.com/s4T6e.gif`\Doot doot`\Warriors fans will outnumber Wolves fans at the game 15 to 1. `\Ricky made a three before Curry

Ricky>Curry`\has lamarcus been playing this well lately?`\Oh, shit. That's crazy. `\lol @ the crowd chanting mvp`\hb finally!`\I can't believe it, we actually beat them. But we have to know that they aren't always gonna shoot like that. Steph makes shots that defy all logic and reasoning. We played awesome defense, but they missed shots that they still normally make.

Either way, I'm seriously looking forward to a seven-game series`\I think you're selling Curry hype short by saying that people say "it's only one game"/"it's just the regular season" when he's consistently tagged as the greatest shooter ever and a no-doubt MVP 1/4 into the year. Aren't they like 11-1 against top teams? Aren't you choosing the easiest, vaguest statements to go after?

Curry must answer for his bad games just like others. If Jordan went 4-18, he'd get shit on too. He doesn't get covered in teflon because he's the best. I think you're just picking out these exceptions and getting angry about it because the Internet shows you thousands upon thousands of opinions and it's easy to gloss over the good ones.

Spurs squashed Curry into sauce tho.`\Dank`\Actually they have practice from the Heart Attack Warriors from the 2013-2014 season where every game seemed possible to lose no matter what because of previous seasons. 20 point lead??? 6 minutes left??Mark Jackson is our coach???? Yea it's gonna go down the wire.

But the terrible coaching really made at least half the game go down the wire, our core got practice during that season. `\FUCK YOU DON"T NEED YOU`\If they're not in your conference it is going to be two games, and he didn't score 92 in one game this year or you may have heard. `\take out randle and hibbert please `\I can't stop laughing. What the fuck just happened??`\i hate dirk that's why `\Hi such, I'm scarydrew`\look at that double team on barnes. it was instant, they're attacking the one guy who *might* be the warrior's weak spot    `\Woosh`\AND 1`\lmao oh god Deron`\Der he go`\Boris Diaw is a Warrior killer.
`\Gotta finish there LMA. `\What a game! `\You happen to have a clip of that? `\Currys  ~D~ blocking fouls and hand checking`\Warriors -17.5
`\Damn, just like the last Lakers game.  Dubs can't find the basket.`\Would not be a Mavs game without a 3rd quarter drought.`\...is this for real?`\Man, I hope Bogut is okay.  We don't win the Finals without him.`\It was a 10 point game with 2 minutes left. They hit two threes to make it 16 and the bench came in. Are you seriously bitching about that?`\Woj reported it is a serious consideration`\Lol. Duncan 8 min`\Not the Larriors anymore`\I'd be fine with him playing for the rockets, haha Harden would give Durant the ball maybe twice`\>The largest difference in winning percentage (min. 25 games played) was .701, when the Clippers (2-24, .077) beat the Jazz (21-6, .778) on March 27, 1999 (via Elias).

Almost as if the Spurs guarded Curry really well and it just wasn't simply 'an off night'. You sound like Skip Bayless. Surprised you didn't say that GSW simply didn't want to win more than the Spurs.`\It's theirs if they want it. Can't wait to see how people try to knock you guys down when you beat it.

He was arguing that warrior fans were being hypocritical about injuries. I was merely pointing out that last we played the Cavs they did indeed have in fact both Love and Irving. A game in which we won quite easily. So the point he was making is kind of irrelevant.

This team, man.....`\Jerry West sitting first row?`\Shaqtin' MVP...`\Is it 2009 again? `\BALL DON'T FUCKING LIE!`\BLOCK THIS.`\Boxing out is missed dearly`\this game?`\16 points on 7/8 shooting, 16 boards! (7 off.), and most surprising of all, 1 Block! on Curry nonetheless! Dude played great. This is one game where +/- didn't justify the performance, dude got a game low -24...meanwhile d-will was a -3.`\The both showed up like last week in the same game, didn't they? Meaning they both had 30. I'll check the stats real quick `\usually its none so you dont have to worry about it`\Klayzerbaijan`\Seems like the Warriors did a great job of forcing Danny Green to be a ballhandler /playmaker. Very disruptive D on Golden States part. Danny's shooting may have been okay comparatively but his decision making on  offense will need to be a fair bit tighter to avoid those errant passes and laggy possessions.  `\I never would have thought that the Lakers playing so well would make me this happy.`\2015-2016 Lakers banner

"We didn't get swept by the Warriors"

pls don't jinx it`\the dankest memeline `\what foul`\David West can have my children`\not the Larriors anymore`\Poor Kawhi got hit so many times. But man just kept going without saying anything.`\Warriors haven't really been able to play comfortable lately, they've had a lot of rough and close games.

Plus they're missing some important players`\You joke, but it's starting to seem that way `\Very impressed by the Timberwolves. They just needed their bench to step up. Definitely can see them as contenders in a few years.`\It won't. We are still second worst in the league by ~4 games. `\I will. `\I expect Huertas to get the Curry treatment on /new this week. I want unreasonable comparisons to every great guard in NBA history.`\Refs should let both teams play a bit more`\Still waiting for Curry to get a call`\Lol with a raptors flair? Did you get tix for free?`\let them fucking play refs.`\Ugh Ian Clark spells disaster. `\The refs haven't been calling perimeter fouls at all. I don't get it. Curry is deciding to take advantage of it I guess.`\Yeah... kind of. Game tonight was more like LLLLLLLWLLLLLLWWWLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLarriors. They didn't lead very long.`\He thinks they don't deserve the word "Magic" in their name, he takes it personally...like "no, let me show you Magic"`\kerr call a timeout`\Just Curry if you want the clicks.`\Where's my BANG at Mike? Godamnit`\COME ON HB PROVE EVERYONE WRONG! pleaseeeeeeee`\gg spurs`\Some of it, yeah. But there were several shots he would have normally hit. `\Has Curry made a three`\FRANCHISE TAG HUERTAS`\Every team is beatable. Warriors have also missed a ton of open shots`\Listening to Marc Jackson during this game makes me wish I had 2k sliders to turn down commentary. `\David Lee has 16 and 16 in 24 minutes.

And they said he was done ;]`\Hes gonna miss out on playing with the Dubs next year`\Spurs stopped Curry in their tracks, which seems to be the key to stop the Warriors `\Oh please, most of those games happened between 2007-2010. Are you really going to compare raw teenage Durant to superstar 2016 Curry?`\He's been crazy all year, but he looked human in the finals last year too. I hope he plays better in these big games`\Spurs "showed their hand" fuck it's all over now.  /s


Edit: in case anyone wants to make this into something controversial. Just pointing out that some of you said the Spurs didn't care about this game or that pop wouldn't show his hand. This is the NBA and everyone cares unless your playing a bottom feeder. Specifically when you are playing for the 1 seed. Spurs came firing on defense. Pretty sure they gave no fucks about showing their game plan.`\look what he was replying to`\at the end of the game?  Yah that was curry`\That Nance dunk tho`\>The Lakers wore Kobe Bryant-themed socks in Sunday's shocking 112-95 win over the Golden State Warriors, marking the first time that an NBA team has ever worn a piece of equipment to honor a current player.

Eventually, he is gonna force some shots up and when they miss, it gets him flustered.`\Props to the Wolves announcers - they weren't annoying to listen to in the way I imagine Barnett/Fitz would be for non-Warriors fans.`\Where do you start with this fucking team?`\Warrior fans all quiet. You soft `\Can you describe what this feeling feels like?  Beating the Warriors? `\That defensive stop was perfect.`\Livingston is a hell of a player.`\Yeah it must suck when it's happening to another team, eh? ;)`\Has been the story of Dirk's career`\Nothing to do with his shooting? So curry just ends up shooting like shit out of no where? Had nothing to do with the excellent defense by the Spurs? Ok`\We'd have a chance to tie or win.`\Ok best player on the Lakers is killing our second unit.`\I'd sure hope not`\Pretty amazing season for the Spurs and Warriors. `\Alright boys...lets run out the clock`\I tried freetail the other day and it was pretty good. I am a big fan of Karbach beers though.

*I'm also in College Station so no San Antonio brews here `\We need robots as refs. Fuck human error`\HUGE problem with GS last play. Curry didn't even try to get open... WTF?`\or how much hes come along since hes been on the warriors.

dude used to airball dunks in philly.`\I don't think he's swole. I think he's just swollen`\The Dubs keep finding new ways to turn the ball over.`\Truly, anything is possible `\Damn.... 20 turnovers?

What was the money line on this game?`\I love the NBA. It's so random sometimes.`\Talk about overreaction haha. At the end of the day, losing by 1 or losing by 20 is still just one loss. Just because it was one of the biggest upsets in regular season history doesn't mean the Warriors will just fall off the wagon and lose 5 in a row lol. `\Damn Steve Kerr, almost red hot with rage there!!`\I dont wanna make assumptions but I don't think he's mentally solid.  To help his confidence is basically the reason he even started over iggy, originally.  `\Are you watching the game or just blindly raging?`\[Excuse me?!](http://i.imgur.com/f2MoA8c.gifv)`\Macadidnt putting in another good game. `\Man, give mah boy dray some water, he's clearly still dehydrated from Hollywood...`\They need to learn to slow the game now every now and then.`\DROPPINDIMES`\HOLY SHIT HUERTAS :O`\He absolutely did.`\He sleepin`\Warrios 54-0 when leading at the half.

THE ONE IN 54-1

CAN IT BE

DO YOU BELIEVE`\refs helped out the Warriors here at the end, shitty calls `\Thanks!`\It feels as if minny are trying to blow the game at this point `\Why do you think. Please, no iggy no bogut no festus. This isn't even close  Back to back. Come on man, Spurs are thing of the past. `\Eh I blame your loss more on the poor decisions making by the Clippers. Some of those fouls and passes were just plain stupid. `\Much love Phoenix - great game. I want Booker so bad (in all ways possible) `\It's seriously "live or die by the 3".`\So happy when the Lakers are up by so much where Kobe can just sit out the fourth quarter.`\Mmmm`\So does defense start in the 2nd qrt?`\MCADOOOOOOO`\Aldridge is on fire. `\Why do you think their fans are whining so hard in here?

Fans reflect commentators, that's why we hate Clippers, Rockets, and Cavs so much.  All of them whine all the time and have the biggest homer goggles. `\what about the tourny?`\Oh man... so glad to see him walking on his own. That looked so damn scary.`\Yea Clipperss do a really good job of it actually. IMO the Clips problem is that they can't contain the other guys in a 4v4 situation. `\a man can dream`\What an awesome game, cant wait for the playoffs.

Really shows how important home court advantage is, Spurs crowd was rockin, Dubs seemed kinda sapped.`\never said you said it meant nothing. I'm just saying that the spurs have showed that even steph curry can be guarded. and I do think he can be contained for 4 games if delladova, a fucking nobody, could contain curry for a couple games in the nba finals last year. Against a much more capable team, i think it's fully possible.`\"Bogut misses shot; Dubs look to sell broken shell of a player for role players."`\Randle being dumb`\Oh crap, the Magic are going to get it so bad tomorrow if the Warriors lose this.`\TURN YA PHONE OFF! :-) `\Is it time for curry's three streak to end?`\"Brick killed a guy!"

"I saw that!"`\He also said, "Watch what you're saying". Super hostile`\FUCK YEAH GO SPURS GO`\That volleyball tap after getting the ball from DLo was amazing haha`\that was funniest thing ive seen all week`\They are pretty great.`\Ugh I actually have to listen to Mark Jackson tonight??`\death to two pt shots and rebounds - a warriors story`\Just that kind of night for Curry. That 3 was halfway down.`\Doesn't matter every game is different. `\Curry pushes off quite a bit huh.`\GG SPURS `\I'm so sorry you lost all that self-post karma`\Agree.

Steph definitely didn't move around off-ball nearly as well as he usually does, but he was still drawing the gravity. He should have shot less from distance or drove to the basket more.`\at this rate no one will. `\> Andre Iguodala's bitchface.

Cut down the turnovers.

Great defensive work. Got people involved. 100% shooting.

Good shit Ricky.`\I wish we'd stop with the contested 3's. They're not going in right now, so the last thing we should be doing is forcing contested ones.

Which is dumb, since we've seen that he's a very scary defender`\I choose not to be butthurt over it because it's a waste of my time and I understand him wanting to go win a championship somewhere. Was I irked at first? Sure, but not too much. The guy's probably nearing the tail-end of his prime and the Spurs are a great team. Obviously I would have prefered it if he had stayed, but if he had to go anywhere, I'm glad it was there.`\Yeah it's not often you get to see Steph [break a 3-point record](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/4a6wv6/stephen_curry_has_broken_george_mcclouds_single/).`\Back in my day Klay would score 37 a quarter`\This is the point in time my high school coach puts in the freshmen and says "don't hurt them" `\How is that not free throws for a foul before the inbound?

great shooting`\If this was coming from anyone besides a Cavs fan you know damn well most people would agree with me`\Agreed. Maybe if he is lucky the Spurs will sign him for the veteran minimum.`\I'm not even mad. Our cornerstones played great, we continue the tank, and we showed that we can run with the big boys. This was the best case scenario for this game.

Although it'd be fucking hilarious if we best the Warriors at home.

I do think that Sam should have called a timeout the second Wiggins secured that last minute rebound. I would've liked to see some play set up to give us a look at a 3, pick and pop with Towns and Lavine maybe with Rubio and Lavine in the corners. Try and grab the lead right then and there.`\And they're so fun to watch when they just seem to hit everything.`\I couldn't tell if Klay tapped it there or not.

They made a lot of adjustments from the other game (tho I'm sure they have a lot more to make for the playoffs), and curry and Thompson haven't even hit a three yet, and they're only up 6. They played their best defensive half of the season considering the opponent, and it's a 3 possession game. `\WOAT team tbh`\Never mind about that audio.

It is your destiny to be part of the Lakers!`\Jesus Christ`\Formation lmao`\Yeah, that's exactly what I'm saying. If they haven't been conditioned to it by now, it's not going to happen. There's a reason why the best defensive teams in the NBA run slower offenses than ours. It's impossible for us to maintain an elite defense while rushing through the offense, and that's why I think Lue's system can't beat the Warriors.`\Boris on pace for 50. 25-25 shooting.`\> Danny Green is making Curry's life horrible

A few months ago, a beat up SA team went on the road to play GS in a game where GS controlled the tempo and SA didn't shoot very well. It was a 30 point Warrior win.

Now, the roles basically were reversed. GS was beat up, on the road, and shot horribly against a SA team that dictated the tempo and pace of the game. The Spurs did win, but it was close the whole way.

That why I think though a series with the Spurs would be an intense dogfight, we'd be alright. JMO.`\Damn you're dumb. Sports *are* regional.

Dirk sets a screen and just stands there, Felton doesn't really attack on the dribble. But you put your PG on a 7 foot pure shooter for no reason.`\Judging by your comment it seems the case `\Lmao, you bastard ahaha! Okay look, I'm finding that lucky yoga pose is working as good as lucky pushups. I'm not scared of pushups, man. I just have absolutely horrendous form! And then I fuck up my neck badly.`\The Warriors are just chucking up shots. Doesn't even seem like they're trying to run plays`\This is heating up for the usual Steph Curry 34-foot game-winner.

Young teams with terrible records find another gear playing against the Warriors.  Might be the playoff like atmosphere.  Might be having no pressure to win because they (and the rest of the world) expect the Warriors to blow them out.

Don't know, but I do enjoy watching rookies/ 2nd year guys play out of their skins.`\> I don't think Steph goes 1-11 on 3s in big games.

I partially agree with your reasonable points, but the above is rather general. This was a big game, however it was a big game against the SSpurs, of which there would be more in a series. The Warriors played on the road and lost. The history has shown their record. So the season series is tied. Steph didn't shoot bad and had an "off night" in a general "big game". He got played really well on D and didn't make his shots either as a result of the D. The D also affects your mind, and it seemed Steph was impacted with his open shots not falling.`\I've just been waiting for the hammer to drop `\Whyre JVG and Mark Jackson talking about us so much`\Anyone still complaining about refs favoring the Warriors? Bad calls both ways, recognize.`\Without Iggy and Ezeli their second unit is fairly weak defensively

With Dirk at center, Bogut is not even playing that much`\He's inconsistent `\Even though this is a pretty slow game I'm kinda glad that GS are showing they can play elite defense for 4 quarters when they want to. This is definitely the best consistent effort I've seen from them all year aside from the first time they played the spurs.`\Danny finally earning his paycheck.`\That's not the narrative.  The narrative is that when you compare the two games so far the dubs are +22 in points.  When the Spurs lost they didn't have Duncan, when we lost we didn't have igoudala, bogut or ezeli. Both times each team won fair and square. When you use this to imagine a 7 game series where the dubs are much more likely to have home court this loss does nothing to change the face that we will still be the favorites `\These young Lakers are playing really well.`\NICK YOUNG > CURRY`\THIS IS THE GREATEST THING TO HAPPEN TO EVERY BANDWAGON WARRIORS FAN`\Season starts now.`\good catch`\What?`\My god that release is so quick`\Bags of it`\Jack don't need no stinkin' last name`\Largest difference in winning percentage in NBA history.

So cwose.
`\Iguodala isn't playing. `\lol idiot`\Fucking Barnes. How you doing this on a contract year?`\It can really be seen that Dubs are on back to back`\lol, not a shooting foul. Oh well.`\didnt watch halftime`\This was different.

Maybe I'm mis-remembering, but it seemed like time stood still for the Mavs.

 It was jarring enough for me to notice.

Good financial move for him. Another year at Duke would have accentuated the huge flaw that is his lack of athleticism. `\Aldridge played out of his mind on the defensive end.

Every time we reach near blowout, refs just start calling these ??? calls. And than after it gets too close, the softest calls suddenly go our way down the stretch.`\Here's to a great second half. Cheers`\Yes. That's why we need a "refs" comment filter option, so those of us who don't want to scroll through endless whining don't have to. If you're into that sort of thing, you can read all the salt your heart desires.`\Well that's a good sign!`\yeah he was always going to be the x-factor while Barnes would be the x-factor against the Spurs`\What a dumb shot by Curry.

They needed to keep it going to carry over to the next gsmes`\They pretty much had their full starting lineup in to close it for the last 3 minutes against our scrubs. Sure there was a bit of "fuck you" for the Clippers in there but admittedly Kerr probably wanted to avoid what nearly happened last time. Still it would've been an all-time bad coaching blunder had any one of Steph-Draymond-Klay been injured while playing against a lineup featuring Pablo and Jeff Ayres in a 16-point game.`\Barnes on Aldridge is a bad idea too. Highly skilled post players still have a ton of value. `\BALL DON'T LIE`\it was close for almost two quarters`\4-1 pick and roll, you don't see that very often`\St3ph!!!`\A month ago Mo could only make shots from an 18-inch strip outside the free throw line. Now he's dangerous from anywhere.`\It's cause we can't shit on Speights anymore. Our fans are pretty terrible sometimes though, they literally think our players 1-15 aren't allowed cold stretches. Acting like this is their first season watching basketball. `\People deny it but Curry has been pretty average in the past two weeks, besides the Mavs game. He's been missing shots he'd normally make every time. `\Zarko, Ike Diogu, POB, Mikki Moore, Corey Spaghetti

Oh man how far we've come`\Haven't they destroyed the lakers every game this year?`\...............................................^^^^what`\Thanks. I've only seen it happen once in a college game, and the team that scored got free throws and the ball (but that might have just been because they were in the bonus at the time).`\It's a "feature". It looks like shit when the line lights up white.`\Just tuning in... Fuck this stupid fucking 3pt light`\Both defenses are playing well. Both offenses struggling a bit. Pretty much what I expected. Considering how bad the Warriors offense has been, 6 points is a manageable deficit.`\Holy shit Rubio`\You are making uncharacteristic mistakes and the refs are calling it tight on perimeter defense, and holding their whistles in the post, which add up to a pattern of calls that don't favor your style of play.`\Thanks. Would be a nice cake day present if we blow out Spurs tomorrow.`\*hoooooowwwwwwwwwlllll*`\The mavs are terrible at using the draft to add cheap complementary players and when they finally had one in Crowder they shipped him off for fuckin Rondo... Lol`\Also like the "deez nuts" guy.`\Speights is lost on d`\Appropriate, if it's us. `\.....Because they already have 10 losses?`\It was a fantastic game no matter who you like`\No, Dallas made them played hard the night before. Dallas doesn't play defense so it was a high scoring shootout and it was close till the final few minutes. That makes a big difference.`\Yeah, Barnes just hasn't been the same since he got injured...`\And Paul also was getting the shots he usually hits.`\Goddammit Chet!`\Yes, Barbosa's height makes him a great target for lobs. `\I can't believe this is happening.`\woah tht pass was Lebron like`\Need to get Kawhi in the game`\Barbosa is giving us a really good boost off the bench`\Man Kawhi was ready to get that rebound.`\Curry so cold tonight. He can't carry the team every single night though. `\There's a 2 game sample size this year. Game 1 GS hit a million threes and won by 30 while both teams were fully healthy. Game 2 GS missed a bunch of threes, that not while not wide open for most people are threes that they usually hit at a good clip and were missing 2 key players and lost by a few points. If you can't look at this objectively and not still think that GS is the better overall team, then I'm sorry, but you don't watch enough basketball. `\True. Hoping we get as healthy as possible before that. Iggy and Bogut in particular are significant losses. I would guess we take it in 7 assuming we can keep homecourt, but I'd be lying if I said I wasn't a bit concerned.`\I think the Hawks have it.`\Oops! Thx yo! `\On behalf of the Lakers organization, you're welcome Western Conference contenders. `\Kobe is too 5 all time fuck you r/NBA efficiency d riders`\Waiting on both coaches to pull their starters for the entire 4th to troll the universe.`\Now THAT is Aldridge's game`\They did last time. `\The fact that no one else wants it only makes me want it more. Ultimate hated underdogs vs. universally loved dominance matchup.`\Just like you guys ain't the Wakers anymore. Sorry not sorry `\Welcome to 2002`\Now kiss`\Yeah but that catch off of Kearse's legs to get them there...

Both these things are a huge advantages for GSW. It's like a different set rules apply.`\Yeah. There are shit calls on both sides of the floor. `\Lol frightening? I doubt anyone in the 8th spot will give GSW as hard a time as the Pelicans did last year. Probably the toughest 4-0 sweep in history.`\for real dray? ilu but dont do that shit`\It's defense. `\thats the joke`\I would be blown away, except for the fact that it's been a fact of life for 20 years and I've gotten used to it. `\What is that?`\11-1 in turnovers.

Good game, try not to lose to the fucking Clips again in the 2nd round so we can have a proper series to settle it.

I'm 26, a full blown child of the 90's. Jordan is God. Those Bulls teams are the pinnacle of sports achievement. What the Warriors are doing, in this age of the game, is unprecedented. Both LeBron AND KD, 2 of the top 20 players of all time, are playing in the league, at extremely high levels. The Warriors are killing everyone. What West and Myers have been able to create, the season the Warriors have had, I haven't seen anything like it. I never thought I would see something like the 01 Lakers where Kobe and Shaq put up 30 points a piece. I was so incredibly wrong. The Warriors this year are the definition of greatness. The worst part is that they'll probably do it for another 4 or 5 years. None of their players are going anywhere. `\Awkward Jalen lol`\Keep me updated on the game reddit!

This is music to /r/nba ears. We are all witnesses to maybe not only the greatest NBA player of all time, but the greatest athlete and sportsman of all time`\Not worried about this team.

And maybe it was from an off ball switch the Warriors were trying to exploit`\Two hands McAdoo`\Lol the commentators salty about being wrong `\THAT WAS GOOD`\Id say the Warriors D performance was just as impressive, considering their entire interior D and best perimeter defender was out`\What about it is waaah exactly? I might be missinf a point`\He's talking about two years ago in the first round.`\well, we kept curry playing till 4th quarter. defense has been looking pretty good besides Nene forgetting to switch assignments. have been some of the softest calls I've seen in a while on both teams. making FT's would make this much closer. new salary cap will allow us to sign anyone.

in all seriousness, especially warriors fans after watching us play y'all, would you be scared if Kevin Durant was playing with Beal and Wall?

`\cheers!`\I think some of that is that the spurs never let him get in a rhythm`\No matter how good of defense you play Steph has shown he can make a shot. Going 1-12 is an aberration. Even on an average day he'd probably shoot 35% from 3 against a defense like the Spurs. On a great day the defense might as well not be there because he'll be off balance and make 3s that are bad shots for everyone not named Curry.`\I'm starting to think fans will get tacos against the Cavs on Thursday too. `\Play 30 seconds, 3 minutes of commercials, play 30 seconds, 3 minutes of commercials... fuck these ABC games`\1.

But I think it would be wrong to suggest he didn't also just have a bad night.

The Warriors are a good team because Steph is an excellent three-point shooter. But they have been *transcendent* this year because Steph has been absolutely bananas on a regular basis. He went 1/12 tonight from 3 - yes, he had hands in his face and was consistently pressured. But he has been shooting unbelievably well in those situations this year. It was actually pretty surprising that he was missing all the tough 3s he was taking, as absurd as that sounds. He has reached a level of play where he can hit those threes where he runs around the arc to create space and then stops on a dime.

I think it's a really bad sign going forward for the Spurs that they won this game by eight, at home, while Steph was off. A couple times this season, Steph has been off and the Warriors have gotten manhandled by worse teams. Anything can happen in a seven game series, but man - the Warriors matched up really well to the Spurs on the defensive end and were offensively competent with Steph missing everything he took from deep.`\Does Russel think he's Curry? He's throwing up every shot he gets `\You can tell clarksons knee is still bothering him.

Dubs missing Iggy, Ezeli and especially Bogut was huge

Spurs still did an amazing job of defending the 3. Curry was cold, but even beyond that they just denied him the opportunity to shoot it all night. That's promising.

LMA has really come into his role here and it's amazing.

Duncan may need to come off the bench in a playoff series vs GS. He's too slow and not potent enough on offense. His humility is amazing.

70 wins is not out of question for the Spurs. `\Thank you!`\Seems like it's been forever since I Heard Fitz say "And the streak continues....."`\This is like the Nationals beating the Globetrotters`\I'm at the game.

I'm feeling good after this game, Warriors defense is on point without their rim defense.`\Even though the Warriors won, that was some great coaching by Scott Skiles.

* Putting Aaron Gordon at center was a great move. Could switch all the time on defense. Rolls to the basket after every pick and roll on offense, leaving Jennings/Oladipo to go one on one with their man/mismatch. Turns out you can outsmall the Warriors.

* Skiles knew Draymond wasn't feeling 100% so he's not gonna be as aggressive as usual so he didn't mind going super small and putting CJ freaking Watson to defend his post ups knowing that he'd probably pass.

'Yes'

'No'`\1) I don't think that's really debatable. You might not find it fun, but I don't think I've ever seen this many casuals suddenly follow the NBA just because of one team. That's a pretty objective indicator they're fun to watch. And as a long-time fan... they are *really* fucking fun to watch. Also, they had the best defense in the league last year so not sure what you're on about.

2) Sure, but those are such minor quibbles that only get amplified because they win so much. Compare that to hate directed at the Shaqobe Lakers, the Paukobe Lakers, the LeBron Heat, the Dwyane Wade Heat, the Bowen-Horry Spurs, the Pierce-Garnett Celtics. It's nothing in comparison.

3) It's not something to figure out. They just benefited from a sheer accident of circumstances leading to the current historicaly well-constructed roster.

Dallas wins in 6, Steph gets the MVP after being eliminated from the playoffs

Dallas gets revenge for 2007`\we lost that lakers game, bud`\BRush is a fan favorite, because he played really well for us before he got hurt, and now it seems like he's finally regained a pretty solid shooting stroke.`\enjoy 'em, they're mostly all Warriors fans now. `\There's a reason he stays in that small Oakland market, big fish in a small pond!`\Wolves fans hows Wiggins doing lately?`\no bystanders`\And we were without the greatest two-way big of all time, our franchise centerpiece.`\Really good performance by him. Vuc being out forced us into small lineups and AG shined tonight. `\Idk I think these were sold out`\Travel god TP`\Quin's gonna be Coach of the Year next year.`\Let's be honest this game was done in the third.`\https://streamable.com/b0n0`\Really, damn`\Lol`\Barnes showing he wants to get paid this offseason`\He plays quite a bit, but he's been hurt. `\yeah that's a double dribble lol`\We can only hope`\It's so bizarre to see GS not play the defense they are capable of playing against this team.`\wtf is up with tht foul`\I just wanna watch these two in a 28 game series. Let them play the first, second, third, and fourth rounds of the play-offs.`\The Spurs never forget`\You're right an I'm an idiot.  thanks fam.`\I know people will troll me, but as much as I wanted to win, I think a loss here is better in the long run.  Warriors were getting too comfortable at times.   I think this will help them alot, getting their focus back.  They've been playing better in the last few games, but they still aren't playing as good as they were at the beginning of the season.`\Barnes got exposed. Two rebounds for him. `\Mo makes good outlet passes though.`\He does have a great smile! `\FUCK YESSS!! WE CAN LOSE THE REST OF OUR GAMES NOW!

It's kinda funny how they celebrate the one bad game while he's destroying the league almost every other game`\Yeah that was a dumb call. Hope Blatt goes to coach the Wolves, really thought he was under appreciated with the Cavaliers.`\Is there a sub for Nba gambling?`\> and will be the reason we will take 2 from you in a 7 game series

You weren't just saying it's not impossible, you were saying they will take 2. That's a quote direct from you.

And yeah, an L is an L, including the last 3 the Mavs took to the Warriors that you're piling up moral victories from.`\Then blazers by 64`\Not just good, he was like 3/4 Dwight Howard circa 2009. Don't know wtf happened to him, especially defensively. `\Stop it right now`\What's a tank to a Dlo?`\Last Year: Damn what are we gonna do when Barnes leaves?

This Year: Thank God Barnes' contract is expiring`\Shower thought: Will CBS/TNT/etc put up the Warriors/Spurs score during the tourney games? `\[500 words on why curry's slipping because he didn't make that half court shot]`\The quicker Mills gets put in, the less concerned I become`\Dubs got the Spurs right where they want them...`\you're still in the game because of draymond, not curry`\idk why being cocky means you're not 'nice'

Great to see life from Barnes. Just in time for his favorite team to play against. `\no call?`\True, can't deny that.

With regards to the Suns specifically though, they've played much better since the Markieff trade and to a lesser extent since Earl Watson took over. Watson has had better rotation management and offensive sets, and most importantly knows how to handle the young players better than Hornacek did. God, I wish TJ Warren was still playing right now. `\Man, what a game so far. I love it, from both teams.`\It's fun watching Golden State snipe threes, but I swear, it's 4 or 5 dudes standing at the arc. Might be the most boring shit since Shaq backing down people in the illegal defense era.`\Hey hey man, let's be civil her. No need for those words. `\It's tough because all you really have to go on is the improvement of the players. But last year Zach LaVine was one of the worst players in the NBA, and this year he's turned into a very useable offensive SG with a pretty high ceiling. Dieng has turned periodic flashes into steady production. Rubio is turning in his best season ever. KAT is clearly an enormous talent, but there are plenty of enormous talents who don't average 18-10 in their rookie season. Tyus Jones went from unplayable to below-average in the course of a season. I just think when you have so many players all improving quickly at once, it says something about the coaching.

It's also worth reading [this rare in-depth interview](https://www.minnpost.com/sports/2016/01/qa-sam-mitchell-weighs-zach-lavine-andrew-wiggins-and-wolves-season-so-far) with Mitchell, where he comes off very well.

To be clear, I don't think SMitch is the coach of the future, unless he delegates in-game responsibilities to an assistant. But his tenure hasn't been a lost year for the Wolves - the team will be better at the end of it than the beginning.`\Would that be overuse, or blue balled under use?`\OK Clarkson`\I like to think we helped.`\Kerr and Timmy r/nbaww`\42 points in a quarter yesterday. 37 in a half today. `\He's been alright.`\Damn HB just gunshot that ball off the backboard`\same here. but for now, fuck you buddy! shakes fist`\Not good to give their player an injury...`\how am i wrong?
`\Curry is a shooter, sometimes those shots dont go in. `\Here comes the turnover on the inbounds pass`\i feel if the ball gets stuck there you should get 1 point`\I missed it!! How can I watch the replay?! NBATV?`\ya he was on tv doing some sort of event on the court while the timeout was going on`\Also missing Iggy and Bogut... they are scary af. But I think our offence was off as well tonight, even accounting for GSW's excellent D.`\Ricky shot the 3 better than Steph...

In fact, the Wolves shot the 3 better than the Warriors. WTF.`\the Spurs just have to win out to get the 1st seed lol`\Huh, I was gonna say that about your fans`\let you know as soon as you take it`\The defense of these two teams is getting me hard.`\Damnit rabsho i hate it but youre right`\Why do I have the awful feeling that curry is gonna hit a buzzer beating 3 to win the game? Please tell me I'm wrong. `\Hey you. I like you.`\So a good looking mo speights?`\They always talk shit. But then again, the same goes for Draymond Green.`\> .666%

Somehow he has gotten worse at the line.`\You just got like 5 fouls at the end of the quarter, how are the refs biased? `\Play doesn't count but wtf how did Kawhi palm a steal looking AWAY from the ball.`\Oh my goodness this officiating. `\There's not being a baby and then there's literally, hitting him again and again like they're trying to post him up 30 ft from the hoop. He will be aching hugely after this game`\what an ugly game`\Horny`\He hasn't been confident in his ability to score since the asb.`\Imagine if you could take 3-pointers as free throws (only from the top), and they counted as 1.5 or 2.`\Lakers got to take this one seriously`\not really`\It's all in the socks`\Nobody is moving, nobody is passing.

Not rocket science to figure that one out.`\Great rotation by the dubs to deny the 3, but gotta clean up and make sure Danny Green doesn't get that rebound`\Cold blooded`\Do you think the Spurs are not playing Timmy much just to give LMA more room to operate in the paint?`\#Please please bench Barnes#`\lol`\yeah he does`\Just a joke among 1000s of comments...`\You gotta start somewhere.

Never would've thought the Spurs could keep the Warriors under 80`\non-aligned fans out here trying to start shit in game threads. why? what does it get you?`\because Wall can't shoot 3's so he runs the ball through the bigs to give a chance for Wall to have an isolation drive, collapse on the bigs for a kick out to Beal or Dudley, or have Nene post up which has worked well (2nd highest FG %, 53%, only behind Gortat's 56%) besides the fact Nene can't shoot FT's, 2-6 tonight. teams double Wall so often he is forced to the outside and have hockey type assists, since there is almost no outside threat for 3 besides Beal and Dudley (Otto-Porter is slowly improving and will hopefully be over 40% next yr). `\Evewybody Wuvs Waymond`\D-Lo and Clarkson to Steph and Klay: "Look at me.

We won by 30 at home and we kept it close the whole game on the road missing our 6th man and starting center.

Who played in either game really isn't the issue here.  One game was close and one game was not (encoded by the +22 factual stat).

As an unbiased observer, do you really think that the Spurs have an advantage in a seven game series?  If so how significant is that advantage?`\damn that was quick`\Draymond is such a twat. He hammered Kawhi then bitched about it.`\The Dubs are missing wide open shots ..`\CP25`\I have never ever seen Livingston miss a mid range jumper`\Curry so good that I'm suprised he's missing contested 3s`\He's frequently a playmaker, nothing new there. He's just been a little bit careless with his ball handling this game.`\no its such an average game its hard to play`\/u/bootum that is your cue.`\That didn't help, but the spurs didn't play Duncan really AT ALL. 8 minutes all game? Both teams were tested tonight without their bigs.`\Put his hand on his shoulder. It was clear on the replay.`\Curry and Klay needs a vacation.`\Nba 2015-2016 champions confirmed `\This game made my day.`\They are ultra Homers this year. Smug as fuck too. `\Warriors going to the Spurs type ball - this is fun to watch`\The claw and his sidekick. Perfect partnership to stop Curry and Klay to be honest. If the Spurs get a defensive that is a 3 and D specialist then they would be unstoppable. Parker is kind of outdated for this modern day game. He can't shoot a 3 to save his life`\Draymond can defend all positions, really, really well. `\Na, fuck you




`\That was a terrible fourth quarter. Come on spurs I'm rooting for you!`\I just got used to seeing it when he was in Portland. I haven't seen a post game interview with him all year so maybe it just made me nostalgic or something.`\maybe curry is reverting back to the norm... law of averages right???`\Soo close... `\I didn't know that mattered?`\He was so good for the start of the season before he got injured. Thought he was gonna take the next step. Right now all he has is the wide open corner 3, an iffy turnaround jumper and a "drive into the paint and hope for FTs".`\They actually fucked up big a few times and allowed some wide open layups and dunks. About 4 that I can remember. Their perimeter D was on point though. I expect the Spurs will watch film and tighten up their D for the next game. They need to be absolutely perfect on defense to beat this team 4 out of 7 times.`\kerr just said goodnight. GG Lakers.`\I am the most casual of NBA casuals. I saw the score on SI.com while looking up articles on Peyton's retirement, and my first thought was, that can't be right. I must be reading that wrong.

Wow.`\Refs not even trying to hide the favoritism towards the Spurs`\Fuck yeah we're playing real good rightnow! `\Why isn't Kawhi taking the last shot? Gino you're old give it up to the man.`\7 points is a blow out?`\Holy fuck Stephs points rn. `\12-4 since ASB. Started March 7-0 as well, they've been picking up.`\Its the equivalent of LMA going cold last game and everyone saying Green shut him down.  This game he dominated.  The difference is we still have bogut, ezeli, and iggy, to throw at LMA.  They have nothing else to throw at curry. `\Holy fuck it feels weird to see you outside r/noveltranslations `\I read somewhere that athletes actually perform better when they're feeling a little 'under the weather.'`\Can GSW please take a time out?`\heh, the one thing we have over the Warriors is that we swept the season series vs LAL`\Oh wow this is easily the best rotation work by SMitch all season`\and a bench`\STREAK IS ALIVE`\The loudest ones just started watching basketball last year, go easy on them`\Yes. Better question is: when is it not?`\I swear every time I come into a Warrior game thread you're complaining about the refs`\Lmao best player in the league leveled by **Huertas** of all people`\Why is draymond laughing? This is beyond embarrassing. `\It was a blowout`\Everyone thinks Dray is yelling trying to pick up a foul, but he's actually just trying to [promote his official shoe sponsor](http://and1.com/live/)`\THAT'S IT STEPH`\SPLASH!`\Not done yet. :(`\Wolves maybe could have used a timeout on that final possession.  Setup a play for Towns`\Yeah, definitely a few sloppy plays but it was nice to see him shoot 6/8 from 3 haha.`\Not sure who to root for, the golden boy or the fundamentals...`\turnovers.`\Wut`\Lol...`\lol without bogut and iggy we kept it close against a completely healthy spurs, we'll see who's the better team when during a rematch`\Doubt it, With the switch heavy defensive gamestyle and the perimeter oriented nature of Golden state Even if Bogut plays, the Aldridge Diaw lineup should still be preferred for its defensive speed, that we saw this game

Plus Playoff Duncan can probably crush a bench defensively and offensively`\Also went to the game tonight. Keeping this game mostly within 10 until the last 3 minutes easily is one of my favorite experiences, especially seeing how GS embarrasses some teams. Only thing I didn't like is seeing Warriors fans outnumber Mavs fans tonight. Otherwise loved it, and hoped OP did too!`\Combined, they shot 60% but Steph brought down Klay's three-point percentage. I say they should trade that scrub to the Lakers.`\When was the Slam Dunk Contest in Toronto other than 2016?`\> lack of oversight is destroying this small window

that window closed already. `\Pulp-free OJ.`\It looked like there were a lot of warriors fans in the arena. `\Agreed, the effort they're showing is pathetic`\She's a brick, HOuSE`\honestly i think he's done for. just bench him and just restart the season next year.`\Average Warriors fan right there.`\This was a good game refs. C'mon brah.`\not even remotely `\"Not really" JVG Lol. What a dick`\Perfect defense`\Ewwww`\Or ya know.. The warriors are having the best season of all time and the spurs are only 3 games back. So id say they're overwhelmingly underrated.. No need to be a hater`\It's sad but you don't mess around with the Achilles at 30 and come back the same.`\They also went on a 7-0 run in around a minute to start the 4th. Suns were previously up nine at that point.`\Goddamn`\IT'S A TRAP.`\I was just about to ask where Clarkson has been after the hot start. AYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY`\The abscence of Bogut and Ezeli is REALLLLLLY showing`\DaviD Lee`\Steph gonna come out refocused. Spurs may still shut him down, lol, but he will be focused!`\I hope Green cries himself to sleep every night. His offense is an embarrassment to the Spurs organization. `\It hasn't been funny for a while.  But I hope y'all get in at 8.  Mavs will make it a contest, no matter the opponent.`\I was tying to lipread Pop's and Kerr's convo after the game. They were hating on the refs as well.`\http://i.imgur.com/zW3vkBz.gifv`\he did not lock up Wall. Wall was locked up bc your coach put so many people in the paint that Wall could not drive as he was double or triple teamed. also realize that Wall is NOT a 3pt shooter so don't take that stat into consideration. Curry CAN block out any shooter that has a great 3pt percentage, but is not as good on driving pg's. yalls coach is smart enough to realize that where if Curry is being drived upon he has told Curry to get in position to intercept a pass and stay on the outside. this has worked really well and gotten Curry many steals.

short story; Curry locks down the outside and if driven upon goes out to stop passing lanes. but that is due to great inside defensive play forcing a pass out which Curry is in the position to steal. it's a TEAM effort to stop a driver like Wall, though Curry is extremely smart at stopping passing lanes.

edit: I am not saying Curry is a bad defender. he is GREAT because he is smart enough to know his role and know that if someone drives it's better for him to get in the passing lane and allow his inside defenders to block the shot or force a pass out. he is amazing on the perimeter and knowing where a pass is going

I want the Warriors to knock out CP3 in the second round for his 10th second round anniversary.

As much as I want the Warriors to be the ones to stomp the Clippers, I'd rather have them lose so ignominiously in the first round that they get blasted back into the middling rebuild phase, and losing to a Gasol-less Grizzlies squad with Lance Stephenson leading the charge would do exactly that.

Other than going 5-5 from 3, it seems like Thompson struggled. And Curry seems to have struggled more than him.

And, as much as I hate to admit it, because I want them to lose, it's probably good for the Warriors. This is the 2nd game in a row where the rest of the team had to play their asses off.

Then I was a fan of Magic, then MJ. I never thought I'd worship anyone like I did Jordan but I really loved Hakeem and KG and admired Duncan.

This Warriors squad is the next in that long line. Nobody has ever shot better than Curry and no team has played more beautifully since Showtime. And I got to see the Dubs a LOT over the years until I got priced out this year.

I just still can't believe it ever happened to our mangy squad.

THANK YOU LAKERS I LIKE YOU FOR ONCE IN MY LIFE`\its the law of averages son.`\Gorgui and KAT worked out with Ben Wallace earlier today. `\wow this new playstation ad is cool `\Diaw the crybaby`\Thank you man`\That's Steph Curry's foul`\I immediately tuned into this after Spurs blew their game and had some hope that GS were equally terrible, and they were! I can't believe they still somehow won that game. `\He's at least average, better than  average three point marksman. He's also a great cutter, can put the ball on the floor a decent amount. `\I like Clarkson. That Laker backcourt with D-Lo looks promising.`\Yeah but so is Sacre. `\bad foul`\Curry usually plays the whole 1st quarter, I see Pop and his coaching staff has Kerr thinking `\Kawhi was cold and timid in the 1st but you can see him getting active now and calling for the ball.`\That defensive effort by Aldridge, wow`\and big ol women`\This game is pretty intense. Shit calls by the refs for both teams, but intense game.`\Nobody cares. All you can do is play the team they field.`\I guess we still scored 59 points in the first half. It gave us a few problems early in the first then we figured it out. `\lol`\Where is that from?`\Add Harden and Dwight and baby... you got a stew going.`\lol`\We desperately need a 3rd scorer. This is why we ain't gonna pay HB.`\OH WOW LOL YOU BLEW A WHISTLE ON CURRY?? NO WAY `\They did not, man. They tried very hard. Our defense was just really aggressive.
`\When you are denied the ball by the best defenders every game you need to take advantage of the aggressive coverage and make plays elsewhere.

Pretty hard to call that a flop, ya dick. `\Bogut and Andre, both of them huge impacts on the game.`\That was strategy tho. `\Yes, I watched the entire game. Yes, it was close the whole game, but an eight point victory in a very low scoring game is a pretty decent margin of victory.`\and he didn't even play in the 4th quarter either!`\Guaranteed. They'll get every 50/50 call and every touch foul in the fourth.`\Warriors did not come out to play`\Yes`\That was an awful 24 second call.

That was one of the strangest, most inconsistently called games I've seen this season. `\That used to exist. In the Philippines or something. Minus the pyramids. `\Wait till we get Durant.`\Just need to go 6-2 now. Crazy to think about how realistic that is now.`\I really don't think he cares about that record in relation to winning the championship.

So scared to win.

Tanking sucks.`\You know your good when so many people take pleasure in your losing`\I'm surprised they didn't call a tech for that continuation dunk.

Can't wait for all the subtweets from curry. `\Byron needs to rethink his gameplan.`\probably a foul on mac`\We got lucky because GSW is playing possibly their worst offense so far this year but we aren't playing special at all either. I know the Spurs will heat up in the second half and I'm going to go ahead and assume that the Dubs will as well.

Steve Kerr should become front runner for coach of the year" in their first meeting?`\worst blue balls of my life`\Maybe I'm getting more cynical but I really feel like they're getting worse every game.  The inconsistency is what kills me.

Once the Warriors were ahead by 15 in the 3rd quarter and the arena was rockin', you could tell the game was over.

The Warriors don't get to 15 ahead, or at least certainly not that quickly,  if Tim Duncan is anchoring the paint in the first half. Curry had 2 or 3 easy backdoor layups.


Would the Spurs have still lost? Very likely. The Dubs controlled the pace, and the refs weren't doing us any favors.

Made the clutch midrange jumper to tie the game near the end, also. `\He is Saying you should have won by more than 30 like the warriors did on January 25, 2016.`\He got hit in the Iguodalas by the ball`\Lol you are an idiot.   Explain to me the fundamental difference between stating that one game was close and one was not and pointing out a +22 point differential across two games knowing that the Warriors lost the second one.

That's right, you can't because they both encode the same goddamn thing.  I'm not sure why you are so hell bent on telling me that I don't know what I'm talking about when you actually seem to agree with me that at best it's a close matchup and if anything the dubs have the edge.

And that, from what little I've watched, is how GS loses. They beat themselves more often than getting beat by the other team. When you live and die by the 3, having an off night will kill you.

Not trying to discount the incredible D by the Spurs though. They swapped guys on and off Curry seamlessly and it definitely contributed to Curry's misses. Whole damn game both teams played lights out. I can't imagine how tired both sides were by the end.`\Yeaaahhhh I think this is about some kinda focus that's different from regular game focus.`\Every time the Dubs got close Knight would put the Suns back out.

Curry did absolutely struggle, and the shooting even on open looks hurt this team in a single digit loss.

I credit the Spurs on a tremendous win. But if we're talking about no love, you gotta talk about Danny Green. That guy set the tempo for this win

EDIT: Again, you do have a point, not enough respect to the Spurs' defense. With all these years of consistent good defense, I think it's an under-recognized part of this team `\Both teams had bad shooting nights and Duncan only played 8 minutes. You're saying the loss is okay because GS shot poorly and were down players, but stayed in it, but the same is true of SA.`\A real team effort`\Sure

https://youtu.be/NSnAvhvfniw`\Jordan Clarkson is a fucking baller`\Going into today I just had a bad feeling this might happen. It happened last year and made no sense and its just too fitting for it not to happen again.`\The 95'-96' Bulls never lost to a bad team and definitely not to a team as bad as the Lakers.  Statistically, today's Warrior loss was the WORST loss in NBA history and was the BIGGEST upset in NBA history.  Now, it's impossible to argue that this year's Warriors are the best in history.  You just can't logically argue that point with this massive blemish on their record.  And they have a very very rough patch coming up against hot teams.  Good bye, Warriors.`\Please let this be a classic`\Is Patty playing alongside Parker a common Spurs rotation?`\that shot looked so weird lol. `\Not when you factor in that warriors are 1-14 from deep and Curry is having his worst game of the season. `\Here Wolves, we'll just give you 20 0r30 extra chances to score`\Pop is smart af. `\i highly doubt we pay him that much...if someone offers him that much i believe the FO will let him walk...and honestly i wouldn't mind with how he's played.`\not even a question`\clear path`\stop pulling up`\Cavs at Christmas, also the only time this season they've been held under 100 iirc`\grow up`\Barnes so bad...`\GINOBITHREE`\ok, IF you saw the game you'd realize those 16 (btw he had a garbage time 2 at the end too) didn't really matter a ton. +/- has its merits and looking at just point total is not the most effective way of judging a players game. He played dumb defense and handled the ball in situations where a better player probably should have been doing it

That's why I bring up his season stats. Why is someone of that skill level handling the ball for most of the 4th? `\swing and a miss`\Dubs fan here. I agree with you. Bought got away with the push off near the end there. `\Certainly not the subreddit dedicated to it`\Clean it up Ricky.

`\There's a shocker. I thought he did every dubs game.`\#bring on the memes`\Fuck this shit.`\Warriors mentally not here. `\CHEERS BARNESYYY`\Whatever, I like Melissa McCarthy.`\Both teams shot poorly. 38 vs 41 percent.

Spurs played without Duncan at Oracle and only had him for 8 minutes tonight.

Like I said below, I was more interested in the coaching and demeanor sides of the equation. I think Spurs have the advantage in both. Talent-wise I think they're more or less even.`\[You tried](http://i.imgur.com/4Ai0bRm.png)`\2 years ago it was the blazers, last year it was the heat, now magic.`\Warriors are playing like it's some kind of preseason game.

I dis however enjoy KLAYSTATION heating up!`\Haha dude, you just don't even know. I don't see people acting like the rest of the league isn't even competition. I didn't see anyone gloat about how we PUNKED the Spurs when we played them. Or we Punked the Clippers. I don't see fans gloat about that, or about the fact that we have one of the best teams ever. There isn't any gloating*. I see a ton of humility, a ton of "we're so lucky" and a ton of appreciation*. But never bragging. At what point to Warriors fans cash in on bragging rights? Probably never cause it's tacky. `\Just got a game-saving block and initiated a break for a Wade dunk... so yeah, you're wrong there too!`\Warriors are their own Achilles' tendon. 15 turnovers and counting, 50% FT shooting `\？`\Twice`\we may as well trade him for picks`\?`\WHAT.

They need depth badly but the starters played lights out.`\okay you can ask anybody in the Wolves sub I am the biggest Mitchell hater on the planet, I've seriously considered streaking in Minneapolis with fire mitchell painted on my buddy but he actually does know how to develop young players to a certain extent.. he can be a decent assistant in the NBA but the fact he's allowed to make instrumental decisions to a team by being the HC is what absolutely boggles my fucking mind, dude is a grade A moron when it comes to that `\He was getting great looks ... a lot of in and out.  It's rare he misses that many open looks.`\The last time he subbed out the starters early, the Clippers almost won the game. `\Tirico and Hubie!!!`\Iggy still out huh?`\Or maybe I just want to be the first seed...?

Naw, it's more likely that I just hate how much attention the Warriors are getting this season and use /r/nba as an outlet for my insecurities. You're right.`\dallas small ball`\Shit, I thought that was only me. It's a little off, I think. `\I would too because refs don't callem`\THEY'RE CH**33**Z**3**IN! `\Has Golden State been exposed?`\DAE Curry sucks?`\Wasn't pretending to be sportsmanlike, fuck you too.

Tony really helps the offense move at a better tick, and if Thompson was able to punish him more in isolation I wonder whether that would have forced Pop's hand with his lineups. `\Yea I'm not necessarily a fan of intentionally missing in general, but when you're playing a team like the Warriors who never miss FT's I would be OK with it if we didn't use the timeout alerting the world of what we would do haha. We absolutely should've called a TO when we had a chance to tie instead of just instantly going ISO Wiggins, but that's what you're gonna get when Smitch is the coach.`\Danny Green has been a monster on defense.  It's a shame his shot left him.`\Spurs "Locked in" Curry`\agreed`\Yeah he was real short on that last one but I'd rather watch him shoot and miss a wide open look ten times in a row than watch him keep passing up the opportunity. so frustrating`\There is a parks and rec joke regarding Garry Gergich here.

I just think that in a series with home court and fully healthy, Golden state will definitely win and there are a lot indications to me that that will be the case. I think there's so many factors that go into the loss yesterday and Steph not playing well should be credit to the defense. However, I don't foresee them being able to contain Steph like this all the time and with Iggy back, more things should open up for the Warriors. On top of that, there were times the Warriors couldn't contain Aldridge on the boards and if they had Bogut they would've deployed him to grab important rebounds and also defend him from time to time.

It's still very raw.`\1/14 from distance. If we just made two more it would be tied. We should be at least 6/14 and up by 9.`\manu giveth, manu taketh

It's so simple - an all-time elite defense has to catch them on the road on the back half of a back-to-back, down three players. It's so obvious. `\Thats what I hate about todays NBA at times. KAT has Klay guarding him on the roll. Just throw that shit up and let him finish it. Instead Wiggins wanted to hit the big shot and it cost them.`\You're right. Dirk > Curry`\I will grow a playoff beard to compensate. A BIGGER beard.. `\Bruh...`\Warriors were in control all game, they just take their foot off the gas at the end of games sometimes. Villanueva just went bonkers to keep it close. There's nothing concerning about 65-7. There's a lot of Warrior fans in here being nice saying "I don't wanna play the Mavs", but the Mavs would be fortunate to take 1 game in a 7 game series. `\Warriors play the Magic next.

Definitely need their height against the spurs.`\I love when Draymond cries its like a baby its just natural `\game, blouses. `\I think it builds their confidence when they can still shoot for 50% even though Curry and Klay were pretty bad. `\Dray was sick which was obvious tonight so hopefully he gets better real soon. He's our best distributor and gets everyone involved in the scoring so we need him healthy.

That's when both teams were at their peak.`\Even before then - in that first minute of the fourth they turned a 9 point deficit into a single possession game.  `\I dunno man.  "One fucking job" is not how I'd describe the task of beating the Warriors at Oracle.`\Im more surprised they have that many assists based on how the rest of the team is shooting. `\Lakers are 1-0 while wearing the special Kobe socks`\Holy shit, what a way to wake up.

Curry + Klay lowlights round 2.`\as good as our defense was, our offense was dogshit. Kawhi / Diaw/ LMA all had mismatches and we didnt exploit them enough. Kawhi particulraly barely touched the ball in the fourth when they were fronting/ doubling LMA.`\That's just a complete disrespect to the warriors defense. Even spurs fans are mostly talking about how well the warriors played defense and kept the game close even missing 2 key players and a consistently used bench player.`\3/28 really?`\I think people have simply forgotten that three point shots are difficult.`\Why are the Lakers on national television?`\GO LAKERS`\Feel like Barnes is going to have a big game after yesterday.`\Is that the same leg where he got the achilles?`\GG it was a great game. Refs sucked on both sides and Leonard needs to start talking to them because they are really fucking him over.

What a game. What an entertaining game.

Crazy that Devin Booker is only 19.`\this game was exciting for all the wrong reasons.`\Nice pass Kobe`\I'm okay with this.`\Gorgui Dieng needs to watch the tugging of the jerseys on defense, he's got 3 fouls in the game.

I was alive when Bird played, but too young.`\Lmaooo that's not how basketball works. You can't just average the point spread and think that is representative of anything.

When the Spurs lost, the Spurs used their bench for the last 1/3 to cruise to the end of the game because the deficit was so big. No way the Warriors would've won by 30 if the Spurs tried until the end. `\Waiting for the most upvoted comment to be about the double dribble`\EL OH EL `\Single digit deficit after going 1/13 from 3.

Your team lost, on the road, to the Spurs. It's not the worst thing in the world. Take it with some dignity. `\What the absolute fuck Wiggins got mauled`\Not sure if you actually mean depreciation, or deprecation. Am several Lone Stars deep.`\No. You can't take that from the Browns.`\I do.`\Warriors D this quarter's been great`\Pretty sure two threes is Manus season high`\Curry is gonna die in this game`\Every single Warriors fan thought those Kawhi fouls were legit lmao`\The Dubs have scored more than this in a half lol`\Harrison Barnes is a fucking enigma.`\ONE OF TWELVE`\WTF that's not even remotely a foul. Even in real time it's blatantly obvious. `\Lmao what the hell was that Rush?`\losing to the lakers`\Especially considering he's having a legit MVP caliber season. `\LMA back to his Portland form.`\Do they just not call hand checks or something?

Go figure.`\How is that possible?`\This has been a super entertaining game`\Of course Jackson is still trying to argue a call that's in the rule book `\No, that was here in Dallas too. NBA is big on Chinese marketing atm. Warriors wear jerseys with Chinese characters all the time. `\The Cavs just lost by 20 lmao.`\because it's their win-record of the season? W = win, L = Lose`\Appeciate`\I'd pay to see the Blazers take OKC for 7`\Chris is a waste!`\Sloppy right now by the Lakers`\Clarkson out shooting Curry and Klay`\Apparently they had the day off in LA yesterday followed by an early game today...`\But steph plays no defense tho?....`\well, there's already plenty of porn stars with the steele surname`\Please.

Please.

`\14-14`\Curry: 10 assists, 1 turnover.`\He greeted Parker right after.`\Killed them on the boards, and scored almost at will from mid-range/the post.`\Wiggins hero ball. Damn.`\W.`\A and K, all the way baby`\holy shit`\I feel like im watching the Heat shoot threes while watching the Warriors`\Standing O`\More grey hair now.`\This 3 point line lighting up is stupid. The line is already a line, we see it.`\I never really go into Warriors game threads. Do they bitch this much about fouls all the time? Damn. `\Bold move, Mavs, intentionally fouling the greatest 3-point shooter in Warriors history.`\Smart Sexy Parsons!`\ESPN after the NCAA Division I Wrestling Matches. SportsCenter with postgame interviews, live from San Antonio. FS Southwest in San Antonio and CSN Bay Area in the Bay Area.`\Man this thread is full of overreaction. That's the way it goes though.

I'll agree that CP3 and JJ were just missing shots though. Curry and Klay played good defense but CP3 had like 3 open shots which he missed. Especially that open 3 where no Warriors player were around him. CP3 just looked tired out there. In fact, all the Clippers shots looked short.`\he does look like Donkey from Shrek`\Or its because they are 12-51`\They're playing one of Kendrick's untitled tracks!!!`\This game shows all of the Warriors weaknesses. They are beatable, even disregarding the cold shooting tonight`\Who is that Vic Mensa looking guy on the court right now for the Warriors?`\Way to over exaggerate `\Needed more height because Towns came in I guess`\Thanks, I guess?`\Pushups. Now!`\lmao don't choke na Andrew`\How does having social media affect your performance?`\KAT is a good basketball player. `\Fuck the..

CLIPPERS`\I was more thinking Dolan and Sterling but those two are pretty bad too. `\for real and dame was what, like 2/11 in the first half? portland didn't lose the game, golden state won it.`\There are also things called obligations.

Then again I'm a Celtics fan and even I've seen ~30 Warriors games this year. `\The play after Horford grabbed and held and took a good 5 steps for his screen? It goes both ways`\Why you laughing on the bench Steph.`\OVER THE BACK`\steph getting 0 calls man`\It was a great game. All we can do is hope for better next season.`\Nahh they kept missing open shots. Much like how you guys cried when Steph went 1 for 11. He missed open shots, like they did. `\Just as Spurs couldn't take down the Oracle.`\Fastest to 60 wins. 73+ almost seems like a foregone conclusion. Obviously us locals are very lucky to have this happen in our backyard, but at what point to we start getting cocky?`\You and me both brother.`\Those quick hands are unbelievable.

However, Thompson is right there with the very best SGs in the league at perimeter defense.  So impressed with his continual growth.`\God damnit now I have to watch this fight again.`\If kd goes to the Clippers, can Adams come along too? `\Most of those games were on a lengthy road trip.`\Wtf is this dumb bullshit. "We respect each other so much". As cringey as "you guys are gonna be scary"`\fire by everyone but the refs`\Big reason why I usually stay out of game and post game threads on here. Too many ignorant and shit comments to deal with.

Spurs has a good chance of coming on top. I think the finals is played in the western conference. Whoever wins the west is going to the win the finals. Of course it's not guaranteed. Just an assumption. `\Like that time this season when he did play and GSW still kicked LAC's ass?`\Pretty much in every sport there is one conference champion game that is the actual championship game and the final is more of a formality. Not always, but it usually works out that way.`\I disagree. I think fundamentally the Warriors are a really likeable team and this is probably as close as we'll ever get, on our lifetimes, to see a team become mythic. I can only really speak for myself, but I think it's amazing. I'm English and it's just as great a story as Leicester in the Premier League.`\Warriors miss the record AND Lakers lose their pick. That's an ideal scenario.`\The Warriors are falling apart...`\I hope /u/era650 got some fucking free tickets for this!`\That's a bad travel, I think Golden State has had 2 travels in this half. One on Steph and one on Klay`\Brick Brothers`\Interesting how the first game between the two didn't have an asterisk. Hmmmmm...`\Is this a reference to something

I looked it up. Great reference `\Is that skyyjohn?`\Kevin Hart could you hit that 3?`\i mean did you see the whole game? sure i'm biased but you can't honestly sit there and tell me we got more calls in our favor compared to the hawks this game overall.`\And 1/12 from three too!`\Thunder fans killing they selves`\How long did it take you do that?`\We got called for a living screen but klay was being bear hugged before that. He was pissed the didn't call the foul on play being raped`\??? That's not a very good comparison lol`\18-2 free throw discrepancy `\These are the Wolves I know and hate. `\Dubs won't miss like that again.`\curry even changed the shoes at halftime.. rip`\Not nearly as bad as the Thunder did.`\Den stef gon stef and rein 3`\D'Lo is so hot today that he would fuck J.Lo `\/r/Unexpected `\I'll always love David Lee no matter where he plays`\Has a minor hip injury. Nothing serious but better to let him rest. `\Offensive????`\Definitely`\It should be decent I guess`\I bet prices for games with bad teams are going to skyrocket at Oracle. Might not be a bad investment actually...`\Silver doesn't know what to do to nerf the Warriors because moving the line back only makes them stronger.`\But that would have been a huge honor. I mean, Evan Turner's the logo`\DON JULIO !!!!!`\I do on all team subs`\Kobe would have to shotgun a twelver of water from the fountain of youth for that to happen. `\They rather he drive which is a smart tactic since he'll be forced to pass it off. He doesn't have the handles to finish in traffic.`\*eight point`\The man did work tonight, big props.

Time to get back his Twitter account!`\So do you just repost the top comment from every Spurs warriors thread or do you actually have something of substance? `\True`\They probably lose one so they don't go 66-6.`\I mean, the guy is averaging 30 PPG and pretty much warrants a double team at all times. He's almost at LeBron levels of importance as far as how the team functions. I'd be shocked if the Warriors didn't look bad in some of these games. `\Showed up to the club. `\As long as the defense is consistent I think it allows for our offensive game to be on and off again from time to time. he spurs seem to be putting more energy into defense than offense to frustrate the other team.`\He was thinking of the espresso in the locker room`\Great alley-"oops" from steph `\That really isn't Breen's fault. Blame ESPN for the odd delay. Seems to only happen on these prime time Saturday games. `\Is the gun broken? =[`\Only because Barnes is guarding him.`\17 game series you mean`\I think the joke referred to how everytime a team beats an inferior team with semi-decent to good young prospects there is always the half-insult "GG, guys (insert young player here) is looking amazing, you'll be sooo scary in the future!" as if to reconcile the loss.`\This "lets make ourselves feel better by diminishing others" lowlight bs sucks, for every star. Let them have a bad game, they human too. Taking joy in someones failure, especially someone at a level you will never achieve, screams insecurity to me. They probably beat themselves up enough over this shit no need for internet losers like us to add to that collective negativity. `\I think we keep huertas next year, guys.`\wow hello /u/nba is a spurs fan.`\37 in a half... oh my...`\lol.`\Okay, he got up and was able to walk. Thank god.

Edit: Wait what`\[Wes matthews](http://imgur.com/gallery/anWYW)`\Awesome! What a cool shoutout, man. Nice that you're a Spurs fan too!`\Danny Green goes ice cold a lot on offense though, which can be infuriating. We're lucky he is so good for us on defense.`\if you're gonna talk that nonsense, it shouldnt have been so close if the warriors didnt get away with so many holds on picks and hacks on drives. easily the spurs should have had 10 more points on calls like that`\Hawks always seem to show up against the Warriors, GG`\Aye!`\Exactly at this point Steph isos are better than what we're already doing`\Whoever labeled ABC as HD at comcast is a god damned liar.`\Heavy lays the crown`\its why players like LeBron flop because it would be harder to see contact otherwise.`\Spurs fans said that about their team today. They had a 21 point lead after 1 quarter. `\No they're just down three.`\Nah, I saw him, he slid his feet right in front of the ref. Crowd didn't react either`\CURRY WHERE YOU AT DOE`\Thanks in advance to the Lakers for winning like 10 more games playing like this `\just got to work and turned on game, can someone give me a run down on why lakers are winning? just bad FG from warriors?`\You got too many bandwagoners that think they know bball`\Always rated them.`\>That said, Durant is probably gonna sign with the Warriors and they'll win the next 11 rings.

Durant attacking middle, Curry doing his drunk butterfly routine from side to side. There's a fun 48 minutes of defense. Like so many other pieces of conventional wisdom, the old "one basketball" chestnut doesn't really apply to Curry the way it (arguably) applies to others. `\Losing my shit watching Green not taking open shots.`\Witnessed history guys`\Wolves are switching far too much`\As is tradition`\Thus begins the downfall of the Warriors `\Yeah. Take that, GS. Nobody beats us by 30 points twice in a row!`\I want a Kawhi jersey.`\LOL`\The late 3 point foul was the dingleberry on top of his bad night.`\Wow... never has so much ridden on 1 game... `\For Huerta's wat`\Guess the Bucks win vs them was a fluke too.`\In fairness that's a not-insignificant amount of hope. You guys will be contenders soon. `\Pop might not care but the team probably does.`\Please wake up Lakers!`\BLOOD STAINS THE ROARACLE DOORS`\That pass was majestic`\bhahahahahahaaa`\*blow whistle*

"Ah I can't think of anything, never mind."`\He's back out there somehow`\Lost to a great team. Doesn't sting too bad now, well see how this effects top seed status. GG Spurs.`\The Spurs perimeter defense is what starts it all, which leads with them getting the defensive rebounds and winning that battle. `\That's their season low.`\Timberwolves really are a year or two away from being a playoff team though. It all depends on whether they can add some cheap depth and the youth keeps maturing(like it has this year).

If anything, Warriors fans know exactly what never ending 20-30 win teams feel like. `\Spurs starters are fresh `\spurs: "Tell me do you bleed?" "You Will"`\I actually don't like Journey. `\Klay proving last time was a fluke. Nothing like a warriors performance with a chip on their shoulder`\kerr angry af but still has a million dollar smile`\Hell probably start with the bench in the 2Q. `\Wolves are a playoff team when Rubio is playing.`\Thought Kawhi was holding back Klay, which he was.`\Clippers making it past 2nd round, calm down`\BLOCKED BY FUCKING GREEN`\so much contact by spurs on curry`\same reason Kevin Hart does the same movie.  $$$$$$$`\*Hail Curry*

*Full of grace*

*The lord is with threes*`\Zinger`\Sorry man. Found this thread from /r/all and used to seeing you in /r/bengals. Didn't know you were a Lakers fan. `\What the fuck, there are 8 games left`\Curry was out that game, but yeah, Mavs got em that time.

I don't think the Warriors are unstoppable, there's a couple teams that I think could potentially take the Warriors down this year (Spurs, Cavs, Clips or OKC). The 35-37 Mavs just aren't one of those teams.`\Whoa, just tuned in. Did not expect that score.`\Dubs are hot

There is zero chance we lose this game now`\he will bring balance to the force`\I think if you are as good as he is, people will think you are smug no matter what you act like.`\Top shelf loss for sure, A1.`\People that dog on Green need to realize this. He likely could have gotten much more elsewhere, but he took a cut without even exploring his options. he plays great D and even with his off shooting this year, I've still expected every single one of them to go in. Eventually he will start hitting. `\Can only lose 3 games now for the record and they still have to play 3 games vs spurs, 2 games AT spurs so it's not much room for error.`\gg Lakers, YOU GUYS ARE GONNA BE SCARY IN A FEW...ERR...`\JVG is talking the truth.  No one ever says "OMG superstar call" for kawhi.  He doesn't get many calls and it pisses me off.  Its basically telling the referees that you have to bitch and flop to get calls instead of playing like a gentleman.  Kawhi needs to raise his bitch level.`\For real, I feel like this gets said every year and most years that's not totally the case.

But definitely keep the circlejerk going. `\Parker ain't nothing but a barker!
`\He was playing with confidence today. That Euro step was awesome`\Meanwhile Kawhi gets called for the offensive foul when he didn't initiate contact whatsoever between him and curry, and what does he do? Just turns around and walks the other way with his hands on his head. That's how you deal with bs calls.`\Lakers sleepwalking through this game, it's frustrating`\If they win 3 more of them they'll probably win the game`\Curry never gets called. It's like the lebron treatment.. except he's not built like a truck.`\JB and Fitz are massive homers but they gave the plays of the night to Minny and they've been praising Towns all night.`\Linsanity vs Vinsanity`\Sort of looked like Klay knocked that`\prepare to get McAdoodoo'd`\Aldridge is huge.`\David Lee really understands the game so well. Can't believe Warrior/Boston fans were calling him garbage.`\He had a good game two nights ago`\hasn't set his feet yet. body drifts on his shot`\Thought his hip thing flared up again. `\WHAT THE FUCK IS THIS`\This third quarter has not been very pretty.`\I mean he is an interim after all `\Killing the spurs wasn't the entire reason you won those 3. Gargle Kobe's nuts all you want, but we all now it was shaq that mostly won those first 3. `\He's just getting ready for the playoffs. `\Or Ezeli. `\It's wrong. 25 W's to start the year (we only had 24)`\EVERYBODY CLAP YOUR HANDS `\lol kerr`\And just like that it's a 6 point game, with the warriors cold shooting you'd think the spurs would have a bigger lead.`\mcadoo...wow`\It was a travel`\Nope it's just a square with the scores on the side. I've been told it's GSW but I think it's LP`\the assbleeds are real...

Not even an eval?`\Barnes with a pinpoint pass to Steve Kerr`\That whistle was so late that I almost got mad.`\jesus what did Kawhi do to the refs`\The problem is the spurs are the only team in the league who can have a "near perfect defence".

>1. A star athlete receives an inordinate amount of media attention and fan interest, and yet his teams never win anything substantial with him (other than maybe some early-round playoff series).

>2. That same athlete leaves his team (either by injury, trade, graduation, free agency or retirement) -- and both the media and fans immediately write off the team for the following season.

It's nothing at all like the Ewing Theory.`\well he got dumped by GSW and Boston and ended up on a sub-.500 team barely hanging onto a playoff spot, I'd say it is him and his lack of effort to be a team player on defense`\http://giphy.com/gifs/friday-gif-craig-ydMZiEb6BbSOk`\Whoooosh`\damn right they are....62-6 and counting`\any good stream links?`\1400+ comments and not even the 2nd Q.

That’s pretty good position, they could definitely contend in 1-3 years. It’s kinda weird how the prospects of many lottery teams look to make the jump. Wonder which ones flame out. Lakers plz.

This was a really fun competitive game to watch, I feel the Dubs made many mistakes on defense which kept the score close, but it just may have been hot shooters.

Knight was insane on 3’s and Curry matched him. Mo Speights came up huge. Suns offense broke down so bad with about 3:40 left in the game and Curry hit another dagger.

This team always seems to have the NoS button ready.

Please. `\You're the best!`\If he bet moneyline (76ers stright up) he wins if the 76ers win. If he bet spread at +20.5 the 76ers would have to lose by less then 20 points (or win) then he wins. If he bet GSW at -20.5 then he would need the Warriors to win by 21 points or more to win.`\oh, okay. makes sense then.`\[Got em Coach](http://i.imgur.com/42ohWHa.jpg)`\Felton looks like he is about to pass out. `\Curry WHY`\Nah, everybody is in playoff mode already with the "rigged" comments and shit. Can't turn back now, unfortunately.`\youtube: "Spurs warriors live stream". No lag and HD`\JFC I hate that term, "cuck". Are all you guys who use it completely unaware of its racist undertones? That its prevalence is due to it being a frequent insult used by white nationalists? `\PAT STACKS COMIN' ATCHA`\Good thing Aldridge deleted his Twitter. `\The Lakers are one of the worst teams in the league right now.  The Warriors on the other hand are contending for greatest in the history of the league.  This is one of the biggest regular season upsets of all time.`\I'm surprised when Steph misses a 35-footer. `\Yeah the no kick call really helped us /s`\Its funny because, I'm sure Spurs fans also said the same thing when down a big man.`\For most of the game even... Then they were getting tired and it showed. `\Damn no rebounding or threes and we were still in it at the end.`\Bills/Pats`\We playing like shit and shots aren't falling. We'll turn it around though.


EDIT: Or not, GG lakers lol`\This is hype as fuck I can't handle it.`\Jesus those hands are fucking massive`\Because we know how to call games better than they do. `\KLAW`\he would be a legit 6MOY candidate had he played for us from the start`\Either because that character works in so many different movie plots, or because she gets typecast: do we even know if she can play a different character?  IDK, Motorhead has made the same album like 30 times and it fucking works, same with Melissa McCarthy.`\"Curry just missed shots he normally makes." `\It's all the churros.`\Well now you're just not being realistic. /s`\This is exactly what happens to Steph too.  In all reality it would be incredibly hard to defend Steph without holding him or hacking every time.  When he doesn't bitch about it, like tonight, he doesn't get jack shit called for him.  I swear he gets fouled every time down the floor`\Hoky is right`\I think Kobe just said "go and get your trophy" to curry while hugging him `\I love you Kawhi.`\Seeing the Spurs perimeter defense should be a reminder than the 96 Bulls would dismantle the Warriors. `\Not often. He's at basically every away game too, btw`\yes`\Nice pass Barnes`\My mind still thought of Chris Mullin even though I know that's wrong.

God I'm old.`\I miss Aminu, crowder, brandan wright and hell I even miss monta. We just don't have enough dynamic players on this team. Parsons going out only exasperated that problem `\It was adorable to see Kerr do his best Pop impression. He's just too nice looking to pull it off correctly. `\We're not the Larriors anymore!`\And a potentially pleasant gift of KD right into Golden State's salary capped arms.`\randle pls`\THE SEASON STARTS NOW!`\Blow them out pls`\Does everyone on the Mavs pull a Harden on every shot?`\yes.`\I'd rather watch Sixers vs Suns than Barbershop 3`\feels good man

No more jokes in this thread please. Only very serious analysis. Nothing funny here. `\pipe down Kerr`\An actual spurs towel?
`\Splash is off today, San Antonio is pro-water conservation`\5 missed layups now?`\no duh ???`\True, true, but 4 of 5 happened in the first quarter. He's settled down in that category`\Oh thank God.`\The refs did not call two travels by both Tony and Dany. Considering Kerr got mad at the refs for peanuts at the beginning I was expecting him to try to TKO the officials on those no calls`\Yea he was never the same after that.  BRUTAL

I also say this in the sincerest possible way...some of your players are damn selfish and seem to freeze AD out (not talking about tonight).. I think they fully believe they are as good as him. `\This masterpiece really captures his Stephortlessness`\Mole Speights`\How many times did they say "not to take anything away from the Lakers"?

He needs to earn his shots with offensive rebounds.`\Oh my god this music`\Use your words`\Rookie Klay averaged 19/3/3 on 44/38/90 as a starter (after Monta was traded). Booker looks great, but you're underselling Klay.

Look, you have to be pretty delusional to try and discredit the Spurs defense like that. They played him about as well as any team could hope to and it clearly showed.`\Splash brothers came through`\Teamless

But i saw what he did to the heat.`\only 16? lol. Besides, we were up by like 32 or 34 before starters started resting and bench choked for a little bit.`\> Dad: I've never even heard of him? Is he that good?

>Mom: Who?

>Mom: hey look at this outdoor rug I found!

>Dad: He can't be that good. I haven't heard of him

>Me: who are you talking about?

>Dad: The crazy looking young kid

>Me: We literally just talked about Russell

>Dad: oh yeah! `\SIMBRON`\hah probably`\Hell yeah! Mavs pull of a fast break for once `\Leonard on curry definitely has nothing to do with it though. Just a bad game for curry. `\We're the LARRRIORS again! We were deceived! ��`\In what world are the Spurs universally loved?

I guess I should just top rooting against them. `\parsons hot`\LMA was so far out on Curry and he still shot and hit that. `\That defense...`\27 percent from three. `\This was, like, 2005 Pistons-Spurs good.`\him or draymond`\Their defense is just too dominant, plus the pop factor. `\Jesus dude`\and while you're there, take some singing lessons too `\Warriors high on turnovers and Splash Bros missing on 3s.`\I see it hahaha`\Too Big Too Strong`\MVP cuz `\1-11 from 3, nice job steph chucky!`\Why don't you google which team has the highest win percentage in NBA history, mmkay?`\Triple double for steph curry! `\ Say what you will but there has been some damn good defense from both teams this game.`\Steph had 10 assists and only 1 turnover. Near triple double.

I don't know if he or Klay should be player of the game. Guess they can share it.`\SAS, defense is so good. WCF going to be very fun. GSW scored less than 80!`\Steph giving props to Sager was great. Broke my heart.`\Curry aint get you high as dis?`\That's actually a good comparison. A sports fan calling an opposing team of NBA players "monkeys", regardless of their intent, would clearly come off as bigoted or at least tone-deaf. Same with using the word cuck.

The argument is not that someone saying "cuck the flippers" is being a racist, all I'm saying is that they are probably naively using a nasty slur and they should be aware of the word's meaning. `\It's funny that you latched on to the +22 thing.   How about just saying the first game wasn't close and the second one was.   You can bet on the Spurs all you want buddy, but it's pretty clear who has the advantage in a seven game series `\It wouldn't be if both my parents didn't watch most of the OSU games he was in.`\Trust me that route doesn't work how you think it might.`\Great game guys. And cherry on top: The Suns are winning. Let's get it`\its beautiful knowing that this tape will be studied by every warriors opponent in the playoffs on how to deal with him now. `\They need a different picture for Curry. Looks like a lizard.`\1-12`\I don't like that strategy much`\The warriors used up their defense against SA. Klay and Steph made up for it.`\Because that wiz khalifa song makes any situation sad. `\Don't be. Enjoy the win :)`\The cold shooting night is the biggest reason they lost.

It has happened a few times this season where they go cold and turn it over but that's so rare that if you rely on that then you are doomed.

What am I missing?`\Bogs absence could be a blessing in disguise. Dubs should be able to run circles around the aging Spurs.`\It's like the fucking stone age in here`\We just saw Curry's first blocked 3 of the season
`\Jumpman oooh`\easy peasy`\It's not over till it's over. I believe 100% that either one can explode after that kind of start.`\The easiest thing to agree on.

FUCK THE CLIPPERS`\bullshit call on kawhi there`\This 4th quarter will depend on fatigue and concentration`\wtf is Verde doing? Take the fuckin shot`\Wiggins has bad shot selection.`\Just stop.`\the tank rolls on`\> because you want more. `\But the Dubs would have to let go of players like Ezeli, right?

Who would come to us because we have the cap space.`\Omfg, I wish for 2012 Kobe...`\Tell me /r/nba, should I upgrade to Windows 10?`\Can't keep shooting 3s. Just not falling tonight. Gotta focus on making passes and easy buckets before the long 3`\Dubs cant make shots and turn the ball over`\Yes it was a bad call but that was a heady play by Clarkson while the Dubs fell asleep looking at each other and the refs.`\ugh fuck`\I mean if they swarm you that much, maybe pass it? Steph with a rare ball hog possession. No idea why.`\his offense is good tho`\5/5`\BARBOSA IS SO FIRED UP`\Basketball bless`\FUCK THE CLIPPERS`\How the fuck do professional basketball players miss so many free throws? Golden State looked disinterested and we couldn't do shit about it. `\Fuck me`\I assumed the game was at 630. I also thought ABC switched to Saturday nights this season. WTF?!? I missed the game.`\Cause the odds are crazy for only $20. It's like betting for holly holm against Rousey`\Yeah, saw the graphic right after. Thanks.`\Justin Anderson must not be allowed to play second halves`\I would say it was literally one clutch shot by Klay. `\Slow down there, Stephen A Smith.`\He goes through his spurts. `\Klay slapped the ball away, so it's not a double dribble`\Lol wtf?`\Not like this...`\Was that not an obvious moving screen...`\No lie I'd bandwagon to for that redhead warrior girl`\If you've got like $30 on you, buy a cheap-ass antenna and then return it after the game.`\So about those fouls...`\If Curry is down there trying to get rebounds, just have Diaw go at him butt first`\Good, good. Just a little longer now.`\> Warriors fans this summer: "Stop using injury excuses to invalidate our title!"
> Warriors fans tonight: "Wow, can't believe it's this close while we're missing x, x, and x. With them it would be a completely different game!"

`\[Summary](https://gfycat.com/PessimisticGentleKronosaurus)`\Just like Curry and Klay likely won't shoot that bad next time.`\He's averaging 8 ppg in 25 minutes, that's not good. They're almost better off when he's the bench. Thanks for trying though `\flu game strong`\2016 Lakers > 96 Bulls???`\When was the last Kerr tech before this one?`\let's hear it for the los angeles nightlife scene`\Yeah, we should but we have the worst owner in the league. He just said a few days ago, "I like our coach (Sam Mitchell) and GM (Milt Newton), they are very nice people." Yeah, this means he's gonna keep em around. Worst. owner. EVER.`\Kawhi no emotion`\You have 25 FTs comn man.`\Lol what commercials does he have where they call him "the mole" on tv`\This might be the worst offensive game by both teams.

Great defense`\You didn't watch that nuggets game they lost then.  He single handedly kept that game within reach.  `\Just thinking back to the We Believe era beating the Blazers in the last game of the regular season to get into the playoffs with a 42-40 record and Fitz saying "wake up the kids- the warriors have finally made the playoffs!!" and comparing that to where we are now is insane. `\Warriors aren't taking this too serious. Ian Clark is in lol`\Warriors wat r u doin`\mcadoo with a good block too`\Of course he makes THAT one`\Sick block, but Jesus Christ.`\Pretty sure GSW would take two points back than having to flop. `\I think the good news is we aren't as terrible as we appear. We're by no means a championship-ready team, but I think we have a pretty good plan for the future.`\fuck that moron`\It's always the fucking Lakers.`\This is the kinda game that sells tickets.`\I dunno, I only got eyes for Parsons tho...`\Hate that the audio is ever so slightly ahead of the video. `\Rebounds hurting us bad`\How is that ironic`\Entirely plausible until you suggested the Clippers would get past the second round.`\Warriors overrated. Kerr needs to be fired after this game. Klay and curry need to be traded. Green needs to be released. It's time to retire bogut and Driggy. `\Shoutout to my boy Millsap for his clutch shooting`\Yea but u guys gotta go like 19-4 to break the record. I would say that record is basically in the bag at this point as well.`\That may be too much for me `\Wut why`\I'm guessing you are watching a CSNBA feed. Most likely is the Warriors crew.`\The top three comment chains are all the same tired jokes.`\D3RK! `\D-Will's jumpshot is flat out **broke** tonight`\tits n ass n big hair`\Barnes so bad`\Yes it is. `\Leandro "Shawn Marion" Barbosa`\The drought is real. `\Nance needs to be in the dunk contest next year`\We are the NBA champs `\And he's actually in the running this year `\Dubs are playing outstanding defense`\Got ya.`\COME ON a whole 10 seconds at the basket `\The Spurs bigs are having s great time against small ball GSW `\I watched it, they were killing us in the paint that night because Duncan was out. But we probably still lose either way.`\How not to defend an inbounds play 101.`\Bruh `\I'm so horny `\Like three missed layups now`\Weak.`\WE DID IT. The streak continues `\Ditto`\Not the Larriors anymore `\Nice congrats!`\Holy shit. Is this real ?`\I don't believe you guys anymore when you say these two are terrible defensively. `\Klay slapped the ball down`\I would be way more scared of this squad than the starters staying in. Starters look absolutely done, accepted the loss. Bench guys can come in and spark.`\Can't help but think the Warriors have no chance with their best 3pt shooting yeti out.`\I wonder what time the Warriors went to bed last night? Party cities like LA and Miami produce upsets like this sometimes. `\Missing both the starting centers and the second unit leader, oh and for good measure our token rookie... Yeah it sucks.`\Let them play refs`\Fuck Danny shoot that`\GS are tired on Defence, reaching a lot more in this 4th`\April 7th @ Oracle `\Papers? What are these papers?

We gotta do this again!`\Nah, we just need a coach in general....it could be anyone at this point`\I think those went to Cleveland, actually.`\Desserts are something sweet. Deserts are just sand.`\I think people are misreading his (strangely worded) comment? He literally said nobody can beat them in a series. Just that any team might take a game off of them with some luck`\Varejao has been pretty decent`\We're missing lots of open looks oh god`\All those bandwagon fans in SA`\Steph Curry got his 3 point shot blocked FOR THE FIRST TIME THIS SEASON`\It would be good for business`\At least this game lived up to the hype, unlike the last one `\hahahaha there was no doubt`\Green needs to go to the basket there. Even I knew he would try to dump to Klay `\You know they will.`\Not enough whistles imo`\that's not an and 1.`\Who is this Clark guy I can safely say I haven't heard of him until tonight? `\So Hardcore Henry is a movie version of a FPS?`\No French Obama No!!`\Fuck, I just had a Ray Allen/Heat moment when Curry shot that.`\If I was a bandwagoner wouldn't I have switched after 3 straight shit seasons, buddy?`\God damnit, we're the Larriors once again. :(`\I would so gay-marry Patty Thrills so he can get his US citizenship`\It's funny because you don't see any Warrior fans complain about the refs while Mavs are livid. Know why? Our commentators aren't bitching like no tomorrow even with the disparity. `\wtf Heat up 30 against Cavs? Man Joe must've been one of the best pick-ups`\Make-up call? How many uncalled travels has Kerr protested? I'm glad he's still in the game.`\lol mavs fans dancing but their faces are like :-|`\I hate you`\They do have an antenna, but they dont pick up abc :/ fuck me `\It was harder to miss that Macadoo lay up than to miss it.`\The Lakers will win this game.`\Maybe Hibbert, but Randle needs those minutes. Bass is better, but he's the future of the team like Randle is.`\Ultimately, looks like Charles Barkley was proved right.`\You know what means, cavs trade lebron for huertas straight up it's their only hope to win the title.`\I'm not sure if Rubio is a championship point guard, but I think he is vastly underrated despite his admittedly bad shooting. `\We didn't have our full squad`\Did they seriously spend all season honoring Kobe for sucking for the past 3 years?`\Uggh`\If the Lakers can do it, any body can. `\I think that even if this ends up being the difference for the record, itll help you much more in the long run. Warriors will be much more motivated and mentally prepared & confident going into a playoff series with the Spurs`\Ugh.`\I really enjoyed listening to them both as they both seem extremely knowledgeable.

It's tough to watch a Kings/Rockets/Cavs broadcast (among others) because of the blatant homerism that those guys display. I feel spoiled when flipping to a Suns game and getting quality announcing. The Celtics guys are pretty good as well. `\Trying to break the TO record`\Warriors clearly not taking the first half all too seriously`\With this loss, Dubs making history again.

Largest loss in terms of winning percentage `\Nobody told me that the 2010 Lakers would show up`\I... I never thought I would ever say this.


Go Spurs `\Did leonard really point down the court when he deflected it lol`\Sure. Dirk just whacked McAdoo on the arm before the last commercial break. No call.`\this is so stressful`\Sucks to lose but I still think the team battled well to keep it within striking distance considering the circumstance. The 1 seed is so much more important after seeing this. The team who has it has a huge advantage!`\He isn't Curry, but what did Lillard do against them like 2 weeks ago?`\All the above. `\Your team is falling apart already `\Huertas is Steph's kryptonite. Suck it rest of the league!`\*Mumba-ed*`\Bandwagoners will bandwagon`\Heat up steph heat up!`\And of course every stream died once the lead exploded.`\Oh god the shrieking female on the stand. `\oh, I didn't know that that was Green, like I say, I missed the first half


anyway:


https://streamable.com/htkz`\Yeah I love rooting for the underdog, but there's too many players/coaches on the Warriors that I like.

Of course Kawhi gets no call. SMH`\Dude, he has that sexy european look.`\Let's go klay`\The rest of the league is nothing compared to these two.`\It wasn't before he edited it. (I'm pretty sure he edited it bc I remember it just being just about the refs, but I have a bad memory so who knows)`\lol...That doesn't make sense dude.`\Right? They had their hand all up on Curry's business the whole game. There was a play where Jordan closed out on a three and handled Curry as he was coming down.`\Bacon Wrapped deep dish pizza? That's exactly how I want to die`\steve buddha kerr. does he even sweat?`\I think that also means we need a bunch of teams ahead of us to only lose.

`\Austin Rivers is so bad defensively. When the team is switching every PnR, he doubles Curry and gives up a lay-up to Draymond. After DeAndre defends really well on a Curry switch, he comes to help at the final moment and fouls Curry. I have no clue why he is playing in the crunch time for Clippers. `\https://streamable.com/8o64`\True, too bad we are currently the 76ers of baseball and are going to lose over 100 games this year lol.

You can't afford to just say, "well Curry you've missed a couple, stop shooting the ball." That isn't how basketball works.

You can make whatever arguments about how humble or not he is, I don't care and I assume he doesn't either. But what you've said just makes zero sense. `\C'mon Randle.. Been playing so well the last two weeks.

Assuming Curry re-signs for the mega max in 2017, the Warriors will have a solid foundation moving forward.`\you must have missed my other post explaining that the wizards are horrendous at drawn up plays bc the personnel they have does not allow them to space the floor. as for TO's.... Wizards down by 6 and he and the team have enough knowledge to get a turnover. why would one call a TO when ones offense plays better at a fast pace, push tempo flow?

Otto has developed great, and I see his 3 PT % being over 40% once they get one more threat on offense that demands a double team. the offense has to flow through the bigs bc Wall is not a 3pt shooter and he is trying to get Wall isolated for better drives that collapse the defense for a kick out to Beal or Dudley or a one on one drive when a big on defense goes out to the perimeter. Gortat didn't play as much bc his defense is not good against the Warriors. Sadly Nene made some bad switches but the defense held GS to a low amount and for the most part played amazingly. But when Wall has to shoot 3's bc the paint is locked down due to not many outside threats, again this is due to personnel and saving up for this offseason, then the offense is not going to look too good.

allowing players to miss FT's??! Nene has 2nd best fg % on the team, and while 2/6 is bad it's not like he took 20 FT's. he had done great post plays. Wall missing 2 FT's is Wittman's fault? they are playing at the toughest arena in the NBA, that happens to every team. Wittman drew up an amazing defensive strategy, had the team come back from deficits with a chance to win the game, and stuck to what works with the wizards and their personnel which is to push the tempo and force turnovers, not have set-up plays where every team knows the 2 or 3 players that can actually shoot the ball.

he trusts his team and Wall to call the correct plays at crunch time which I think is one of the best qualities a coach can have`\This Russell kid looks pretty good.

Don't see many Laker fans crying that they didn't pick Okafor anymore.

Have some patience!`\He is, but give credit to the defense.`\Will this be the thread that rises to the top???`\I just don't understand why people rag on a dude breathing through his mouth after sprinting up and down the court and getting bodied by 7' monsters for 40 minutes a game.

Draymond "Future Hall of Famer" Green showing the world why he REALLY shouldn't be the primary ball handler. The guy has more turnovers than a goddamn bakery. Steph and Klay shooting like 5 year olds from downtown. Barnes and Bogut as useful as always. Fantastic.

All it takes is Draymond Green to impregnate Curry's girlfriend and bam, locker room schism. Draymond gets traded to the Nuggets, Thompson becomes jealous of Curry and signs a deal with the Wizards and before you know the dynasty is gone before it begins. That's why it's important to appreciate it for what it is now.

That said, Durant is probably gonna sign with the Warriors and they'll win the next 11 rings.

So did the Spurs. All I would assert is that those were is advantages the Spurs enjoyed today that won't be present in a seven game series. I hope both clubs are healthy, but I won't be a salty turd if a short-handed Warriors team loses to a full-strength Spurs club.

My biggest takeaways from tonight's game: fuck Draymond Green. The pouting after obvious calls, the two handed screens, the terrible passes, the flexing after every bucket - seriously fuck that dude. On the other hand, Klay was a joy to watch, like god damn some of those shots he hit. Curry was just a tiny bit off all night but you'd never know it looking at the box score (partially due to those free layups at the end). `\Shit, you might be right.`\Yeah but that game was in Portland.

I think the only game we actually should've lost but didn't at home was Brooklyn when Iguodala hit a miracle 3 and Lopez missed the game winning tip in.`\damn lakers game all over again. ABC network curse or something`\weak ass call`\Danny has been the Spurs MVP this game so far.`\In a series the Spurs will own them `\Definitely agree.

BEST BELIEVE DAT! `\If these teams keep failing to beat the Warriors MJ himself will come out of retirement to preserve that 72-10 record`\No kidding. That's why I always hate the arguments from (albeit mostly "casual") fans who try to say the best defense is in college. When half of your offense is literally: two broken down plays, failed drive to the basket, followed by a shitty last-second shot, you can't say things like that about stout defense `\Lakers have stolen the Warriors talent like the Monstars`\Man, if only we kept Ed Davis this season.`\Yes. Early in the game. `\lmao. Im loving this!`\Lakers got to stop sleepwalking tho`\Seriously? That's what you care about right now? `\With the stimulation of two or three consecutive shots, Mo Speights' body actually directs more bloodflow to his mole, which heats up to around 120 F.

That's nearly flagrant levels. Full arm extension.

And GSW fans are always wondering why people think the refs are completely on their side... `\Steph had 5 TO as well, needs to buck up for the playoffs. `\[Strong fans behind the Lakers bench. :}](https://gfycat.com/WateryDelectableKiwi)`\Randle is Byron's inside man`\THERE WILL BE BUZZER BEATERS`\Do non warrior fans understand why we're giving Barnes shit now...`\No he's probably on CBS talking about College Basketball even though he has no idea what he's saying.`\IT BLEEDS`\Omg`\Grammatically, he's ambiguous.`\Lolol you guys barely won at home with the Warriors missing three of their best defenders and playing a back to back and 6th game in 9 nights`\It's crazy to think that even with the season the Warriors are having, the Spurs still have a really good chance to overtake them for the first seed. `\This!

Just cause...`\Let's go Magic tomorrow!`\One thing I can't stand about Spurs. They don't capitalize well.  They could be up by way more but then they turn the ball over. `\CLUTCH HARRISON`\Listening to the Mavs post-game show, you guys don't have much use for a 4 that doesn't shoot the three. Olynyk takes that role for you guys, and there are other younger guys that play better than Lee. Just never got the time I assumed, or when he did, he had to play a different role he isn't good at like full rim protector. `\Listen I never meant that this game is nothing. I use regular season matchups between contenders to help me find out how teams matchup. All I'm saying is that in 7 game series, I think Warriors will win at full health and especially when considering home court. This game gave me indications of that. I didn't say no credit to San Antonio, they played a great game. I just was impressed by the Warriors staying in a game that was dictated by the Spurs (in pace), in San Antonio, on a back to back with two key players out. Add in the fact that Gstate beat them soundly last outing as well and I know who I'm taking in a series between the two. `\It probably won't work every single game since Curry will always have games where he just hits circus shot after circus shot. But if any defensive combo can give him trouble for the entire game, it is Kawhi/Green.`\Stephen Curry sucks in 2k they really cant replicate his dominance in 2k because contested shots are usually misses. Also they cant get his off the dribble bombs in 2k either.`\"kobeee"`\Felton locking 'em down`\Warriors defense just better right now though they're cold from 3, I get the feeling kerr wants to play steph through the whole fourth quarter, that's why he rested him in the first. `\MCADOODOO.`\>courter `\curry breaks the curse with a vengeance.`\GG Spurs until next time`\SECAUCUS SECAUCUS SECAUCUS`\As someone who watches a lot of austin rivers he is actually a pretty decent defender.

LMA, Diaw and West harassed us down low.

Lol why do you keep assuming I'm from Texas you SJW bay-area cuck`\I've seen every warriors game for 2 years. Never has there been a game when he just got uninterested and unmotivated bc he missed a few. To me there was something about this, possibly an intentional loss which sounds crazy I know. But never have the Warriors this year lost a game that was close in the 4th (except senver). Spurs didn't do anything in the 4th really that was impressive. Danny green made a shot, great. This series will go 5 if the Spurs even make it that far. `\Man this is insane.

So the opponent will have about 0.4 wins when we're done.`\I can`\Great defense by SA but Curry and Klay aren't going to get shutdown often.  Also being without Bogut AND Ezeli really screwed the Dubs which won't happen in the playoffs.  For the Spurs to only be up by two possessions in the final minute vs a short handed Warrior team on the second of a back to back with Curry and Klay having a terrible shooting night tells me that the WCF is not going to be close.`\You telling me Nick Young isn't the future of the franchise?`\Why are people so excited for Curry lowlights lol?`\curry was fouled like 3 times`\Curry and Barnes sucking dick today`\mavs small ball`\I'm excited for the Spurs fans to come flood this thread now.`\These two teams are the only ones that can beat each other in a 7 game series, imo. `\/u/bootum

Don't care if he got the ball first.`\Well you can go fuck yourself.`\Oh, I totally get it. It's just an inherent risk in the strategy. 99% of the time, those two are shooting well.

They can keep running and executing when other teams start to flag.  Whoever is in charge of their strength and conditioning, and nutrition should get some kind of "of the year" award.

I think it might be part of OKC's late game problems- they get tired and then make bad decisions.

Unless SA and CLE can control the pace, I don't see either of them taking a series from GS.  And the longer a series lasts, the odds will get worse for them.`\When the GSW faces a little bit of serious defense, they tank.
`\That was slick`\25-57`\true but i hadnt refreshed for a while at the time of that comment.`\Insane defensive play!`\three ball is gonna cost the warriors this game..`\"Looking like Iguodala. Yes I said Iguodala"`\He'd probably kill Klay/Green/McAdoo if they got this touchy with him. `\To /r/all people who don't know what's going on:

The Golden State Warriors are fresh off a championship win last season, and are tearing it up this year. Before this game, they were 55-5, which is the best record ever at 60 games played, and is on pace to beat the best record set by what some people argue to be the greatest team ever, the '96 Bulls with a 72-10 record.

The LA Lakers, on the other hand, were 12-51, which might be the worst record a Lakers team has ever had (citation needed). Many basketball fans call the team "the tank," which is a reference to how a team will sometimes purposely lose games to hopefully get a high pick in the draft and create a better team next year.

Today, however, by a score of 95-112, the Warriors lost to the Lakers. Statistically, this is the biggest upset ever in the history of the NBA: the .917 win ratio Warriors vs the .190 win ratio Lakers. This huge upset is the reason why you see this post on /r/all.

My personal opinion: fuck the ~~Clippers~~ Lakers (JK I love the Lakers; they were the only basketball team my parents knew when we came to America, so my whole family's fans).`\First Tate, then Diaz, now the Lakers its truly march madness season.`\You're goddamn right.`\I'll be the first to agree with you on SAC, HOU, and CLE's announcers. Holy hell do they love their teams. Fine by me because it's marketed to their home town obviously. But the things they say are downright too homer for me to watch.

The Celts are pretty good, but I'm not the biggest Heinsohn fan. He's a bit too old and homer-y, but he gets a pass for being the color commentator for such a long time. A couple of others I enjoy are, as of this game, Jim Barnett of GSW, and Ian Eagle on Brooklyn's broadcast.

`\For whatever reason it looked like something he stole from Terry Crews`\Best team in California AT LEAST. `\Oh ok. ��`\Its so fucking annoying. Does Rick not see that is when the drought comes??`\mills flopping well out there`\Spurs dodged a huge bullet by getting this lucky to play Curry on an off night.  `\Completely agreed, after we lost that series, I knew we had the talent to advance far in the playoffs but something was holding us back. Mjax was the only question left, and I was so happy the front office fired him after that series.

Breaking up Warriors' ball reversal multiple times.`\Its one fucking game`\That pass fake fooled me.`\Huertas the new curry stopper to Cleveland confirmed`\112-95 doesn't look like a win to me`\For all the bandwagon comments, San Antonio has a huge population of California transplants.

I'm sure a bunch of the people they're showing are bandwagoners but it's entirely possible many of them are legit and actually could name some warriors players pre-steph`\shaun livingston out here`\Just get a custom one! It'll last forever since your name can't get traded. Lol! `\This game is so ugly yet intense`\This shit is getting out of hand`\Yea Clips gotta fix their defense from their 3/4 spots. DeAndre also seems to struggle when stepping out on guards. Still, I'd rather face the Thunder over the Clippers. The JJ/CP3 backcourt is one of few defensive backcourts that can give the Warriors trouble like KCP/RJax did this year. `\The Warriors get outrebounded often. Didn't OKC outrebound them by like 25 in that Curry halfcourt buzzer beater game?`\Lol can we at least give the Warriors some credit for putting up a fight considering the disadvantages they were facing? For Christ's sake we were reduced to having Draymond Green be our starting center`\No more fleeting satisfaction in the NBA then.`\Trailblazers have a very real chance of winning that series if McCollum or someone else can consistently deliver scoring for the series.

The Lakers figured it out, the spurs figured it out, yet every other team in between just lets it happen. I don't know. `\He may be this generations Jeff Green.

Danny Green's coverage was impeccable. Kawhi's disruption palpable. Definitely got our revenge for last game's blowout -- blowout isn't this Spurs' team's style, the chokehold defense holding the motherfucking warriors to less than 80 points is their definitive modus operandi.

`\Too often people look at what he's lacking instead of what he's starting off with. I can't think of any forward other than Lebron and Griffin who has his first step speed. And sure, he only uses one hand, which makes it all the more impressive that it takes double teams to stop him in the post. Draymond couldn't stop him in one-on-one bully ball. His quick second jump is Drummond like for rebounds. His main issue is IQ which, as we've seen with Westbrook (still does something stupid ever so often but far less than he used to) can improve over time.`\Both teams seem super nervous. Except maybe Boris. `\Nah he just ran into the best fast break defender in the NBA. `\My God! That hand is beautiful!`\ugh i don't like this game, we are playing terrible except for the 15 3s`\BAM FUCK YA RUSH`\color me jelly!

Lots of shots from both sides in quick succession is the Warriors' key to victory (most of the time).

Throwback to 2010 World Cup. It's a cool ad, I'd watch the whole thing.`\classic Spurs!!!`\Absolutely disgustingly good defense`\The shot will be negated if and only if  the foul is before the shot. In this case,  it would be negated. It's basically the same situation as the green 3 earlier in the game that got waved off. `\What was that defense just now`\Steph's ball handling is retarded`\I'm thinking yes. `\the defense is real in this game`\Ooooh, okay. Gotcha. And I've been playing a lot of Destiny and I'm addicted to the gunplay of that game.

Don't get me wrong, it's probably an awesome game. It just wasn't my thing, personally. It may have been the third person stuff or the way it plays, but I didn't find it entertaining. `\Hornets are actually #1 in terms of per game.`\The Dubs are back!

After a huge loss against the Lakers yesterday, the Warriors were back home, hoping to get back to winning games and being better than the Spurs (see fivethirtyeight article linked in the top stickied post).

The Magic last played at home on Friday in a disappointing loss versus the Suns. While they got the weekend off, they were preparing for a 4-game west coast trip, and the Warriors were the first stop in their journey.

Despite a dismal 24 turnovers (to the Magic's 15), Curry and the gang were able to come out on top 119-113. With this game, Curry hit his 300th and 301st 3-pointer this season, being the first and only player to do so. Also, the Warriors got their 45th straight home game win, beating the '96 Bulls record of 44.

My personal opinion: look out for more Dubs/Bulls comparisons on SC and on /r/nba. Dray gotta step it up too. Speights and Bogut stealing his "escape valve" job!

Edit: wording.`\Looks like the 2K Hot/Cold System is affecting the Warriors tonight. /s`\Only curry gets an "airballll" from opposing fans from half court haha`\People yelling airball when he shot that from half court.`\Game got tied.

I think the offense for both teams was as good as they could have been considering the level of defence that both teams had.`\And that's what they did and very well at that.  If the shoe were on the other foot (Spurs playing back to back on road with injuries and players resting), the shoe would have put well up the Spurs butts...

I hope we win but honestly, I've never seen anything like the Warriors this year; they're just on a different level than any team ever has been and in all honesty I'm just trying to force myself to enjoy this season while coping with the fact that I don't think anyone can beat them.`\KOBE SEATS, GOT THE WHOLE CURRY BLEACHED`\I thought Kerr was going to choke a ref out.

I always question when people say a head coach is a good developmental coach - I don't see it, especially (a) when it's top tier players and (b) when the coach isn't a good coach.

And now they are here saying they miss their missing players. `\Navy Seal in Zero Dark Thirty.`\He's a defensive liability that can generate points on his own.  If you put him around other bad defensive players, you're going to have a bad time.  If you surround him with 4 good defensive players that can mask his weaknesses, his scoring can be quite useful.

Kobe would have demanded he be played 30 minutes, went 4/25, and the Lakers would have lost. `\How about the Grizz upsetting the Clippers?`\Curry and Klay had an off game AGAIN. But we have a 3rd All-Star: Draymond Green. Saved the game. That was a great out-of-bounds play.

Gotta defend them better man, it's not going to last long. `\Tony to Bobo: fuckin up my dimes bro`\Holy makeup call`\the nba should just retire the three point line. i mean at this point it's just unfair. how can anyone hope to compete with Bogut when he's shooting 100% from the three point line. `\Out of 12 Warriors that played tonight, 8 hit at least 1 3FG.

All the teams play back to back games and suffer from injuries.

You can't use these reasons to justify the loss of Warriors today. You are almost suggesting that Spurs should've just give this game away just cuz an incomplete GSW is on a b2b game, it's like you are putting them into a lose-lose situation -> "Win? They are on b2b and missing few players. Lose? You can't even beat an incomplete Warriors!"

But then we gotta remember Duncan would've played more if Bogut played. So i dont think they would have beat them this bad on the boards, but they still would've had an advantage there.

Also, spurs basically shot the same as they did in the last game so it was really just their D picking up. they had a poor offensive game. `\Just got you on the head this time Dirk.....don't make us bring in Livingston`\Kawhi is pretty fantastic tho`\He was unreliable for sure.

I feel exceptionally good after this loss. Playoffs will be no problem. `\Great game suns fans. Knight and Booker and Bledsoe is a great guard core`\Why not bring Kevin McHale to the TWolves?

CURRY GETTING HARASSSSED`\They can't break it.  Best they could do is tie it.  `\Duncan isn't much of an offensive player anyways.  Bogut is better than Duncan at this point.  Missing Ezeli and Iggy too.  Ezeli + Bogut completely changes the game in the paint.

Both teams played great defense, but Curry got some good looks that just didnt go in.  That doesn't happen often.  You can play tight defense on him but that doesn't phase him.

Not only that but his is our 3rd game in 4 nights, including back to back.

Not even considering home/away, the Warriors were significantly more disadvantaged than the Spurs. `\Feed BDD, his threes are falling.`\Curry is 2nd in usage and 25th in FTA/game, so not really.`\They obviously reviewed it and determined it was good.`\Steph and Draymond play amongst themselves too often sometimes.`\*Duncan with the greatest 8 min of basketball in NBA history*

- ESPN writers`\GG Wolves, great young core. Just needs a really good developmental coach.`\Warriors definitely not on their "A" game but Lakers are playing their best basketball of the season. So stoked.`\Pop!`\WTF Curry... That is amazing lol`\That makes sense. I first noticed during the OKC warriors game`\HE'S ALIVEEEEEEE`\Kick ball`\Lol slo mo diaw`\Danny's game is like Steph's on the autism spectrum
`\I guess it's just cuz people love to complain about shit. And Draymond, aside from the refs themselves, was the main thing to complain about.`\Yeah I thought I missed something out there`\Good thing I'm off on Wednesday `\Bogut had 19 point and no turn overs.

SMH`\Every team should wear Kobe socks against the Warriors`\They came to play man, damn.`\Steph for Huertas straight up`\I wouldn't even be mad, I'd just be impressed.`\You could say the same thing about the Spurs. `\Was he shown on TV or anything? Seems like a random thing to say. `\I will live with these bailout threes and wild shots from the Warriors if we keep up the defense and offense`\Defense`\Not a good shot `\I expect to see some goddamn Curry lowlights later and I hope to god the Dubs video coordinators do too. He got destroyed today and the staff definitely needs to watch this game in order to adjust their game plan better in the future`\You could say they're... *Robots*`\Never again`\We've got more and more idiots now. Brush is a better shooter and Barnes is better at everything else `\lol that wasn't even the worst play for him. He had a wide open layup when he was posting up with no one behind him and the guy just stood there for 2 seconds until Andy started guarding him again.`\Win #67. 67 wins in back-to-back seasons. That shit is crazy in today's NBA.

P.S. We love you, Craig!!

Edit:  I said this on the game thread earlier already but the way the Warriors just erases leads as fast and as entertaining as they do just makes me happy. So fun to watch. If you don't like it, you don't like NBA basketball`\Finally.  Someone with the balls to say it.  We've had to put up with his half-assed play for YEARS!  Dude sits himself out of the most important game of the year.  Luckily we signed LMA. Dammit Duncan!`\LETS GO LAKERS`\Old heads checking ESPN with a smile right about now. `\We need to stop missing open shots`\They stylin on us`\WE WANT KEVON`\I love this game`\Her husband directs all of her movies I think`\Warriors can't rebound for shit without Bogut `\[Please](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/TACa9mExYFI/maxresdefault.jpg)`\Wish he stayed around rather than requesting the trade to BOS. Much better than Jason Thompson :/`\Obligatory fuck the Seahawks`\Yes, this is the part that many of us are forgetting.

When Harrison turned down that extension he (IMO) rejected being a team player on a once in a lifetime team.  He was chasing the big pay-day, and that's totally fine, but it was now up to him to put up the production to deserve that pay and he's failing miserably.

From everything I've heard he probably will get a max contract and on this team I feel like that will be a disaster.  Chemistry on the Warriors is so important and to have Barnes making so much more than Klay and Dray would be a problem.  I'm very okay w/ him getting maxed out somewhere else and have our big three intact and happy.


`\Damn, Huerta missed a wide open Nick there`\http://i.imgur.com/pdOlkOe.png`\Nice ball movement by Golden State in transition, then later drawing the turnover on the ensuing possession. Wonderful, guys!

`\No, you're just dropping acid.`\Yo I'm pretty sure most people want to see the Warriors break the record. Regardless of whether you are a GSW fan or not it's still exciting to watch history. `\This is too fucking close for comfort...`\Steph got eaten.`\No, Rubio slid with both feet on the floor lol`\A rivalry doesn't necessarily go away just because two teams are unevenly matched.`\ball dont lie`\i love his heart and effort but i've never seen one player take so many balls off his knees`\Deron has been trash`\LMA killing us on the boards`\Cmon, Boris, you know better than that.`\Kevin Martin is not exactly a guy I picture in a specific jersey but he does look weird in a Spurs jersey to me.`\Bad shooting. GSW started 2 of 15 from three and are getting out rebounded like crazy. Spurs should be up by at least 20.`\The Warriors roleplayers have played out of their minds tonight.

I could see the Spurs being able to shut down Curry and Thompson for a few games, though, so can they do it for a series?`\If Nicki comes out to Oracle we're fucked`\some of that good ole Orlando magic

Seriously, when you can shoot threes at the rate the Warriors can, you can make up for a multitude of faults. `\Right now the three ball is bailing out Green awful shot, Barnes disaperance, and their high turnovers. Pretty powerful weapon`\The fuck you say you little bisch???`\> Curry's stupid fucking pubic chin hair,

You know that's where *it* comes from right?`\He's a good rebounder. Look, just remember me when Randle disappoints you in a few years.`\It's terrible, that's what it is. `\Yeah. Fuck da Warriors`\if you also believe curry doesn't get mauled everytime he runs off screens and refs don't call that everytime because they can't but it's legit fouls`\Yeah. Sucks we lost, but I feel pretty good looking at the circumstances. Hopefully everyone gets back healthy and we can start rebounding again.`\WTF is with these warriors haters and their shameless lies

http://imgur.com/a/X3r6h`\You probably weren't here for the off season when everyone was just calling them lucky. And how much they got shat on for first 3 games of the finals. Calling Curry and Dray a choke artist.. and all summer saying they only won because of injuries.`\TANK TRANSFORMED TO A BEAST`\I don't think Livingston ever misses that turnaround fade. `\The refs are appeasing Steve Kerr after he yells at them. Grow some balls, and be consistent with your calls.`\How was that not a kick ball?`\I'm thinking Kawhi's about to take this one over. `\The fuck are you complaining about Draymond`\WCF is going to be amazing`\Curry is really getting some fouls tonight`\You really shouldn't be, he takes trash shots all the time. He usually makes them though, and we all ignore it`\Oh, I get it. You're the dude who has an excuse for everything. `\You know, for 17 years I had never been self-conscious about or even took notice of the fact that I was a mouthbreather. I never realized it was a problem, I'm just tryna fucking get me some goddamn air over here.

So fuck you. And you. And the rest of you. Dray and I and the rest of us will hang our jaws in defiance, breathe through our mouths out of spite. Just to say "FUCK YOU" to your prejudice. And FUCK THE CLIPPERS.`\Nice Alley-oop Bogut lol`\Fuck Dray, just let Kobe shoot the 3. `\Laker guards are playing lights out, warrior shots not falling, hopefully the Lakers can keep this up in the second half`\Whatever they did last night, it wasn't preparation for the game. Shit is so ugly.`\Good job Lakers`\By fouling? `\They see the discrepancy, will mention a handful of specific calls which may or may not be correct, but completely disregard the outside shooting...or maybe they secretly believe the Warriors are being hacked on the 3s as well. `\tony parker has been hitting big shots for years now`\I get the feeling that the Warriors are going to get murdered tomorrow. Specifically if Bogut is out.`\In a weird way I'm glad the lakers are bad now and are avoiding wasting away years of contention in the new "warriorswinlol" nba. Hopefully we'll be great again right as the Warriors slow down`\they are one of the most successful franchises and won championships in 2009 and 2010. they also have one of the most well known and iconic players of the last few generations in kobe bryant. kobe is in his 20th season and retiring after this year which is a big reason they have fallen off, they are transitioning between good teams built around kobe and trying to rebuild the team with talented young players.`\omg corner bank WOW`\it's very valuable; more team stats would be very nice to see too, like FG ratios, 3pt ratios, # of fouls or FT shot
`\They're fucking new to basketball. I believe they were all born after 2005 as well.`\2005 finals defense up in here`\Livingston is the better player, but we benifit way more having him come off the bench. `\That game is on NBA TV Canada multiple times a week up here lol`\What just happened... lol`\I would give this gold if I had any money :(`\dont have to be sorry dear`\r/nbastreams`\MVP`\Curry 4-17 and 1-11 from 3 man thats crazy`\"Thank you Spurs"

GG Spurs. Your D was amazing and shut us down tonight`\You have the right to be wrong, you clearly don't want warrior games regularly.  You can play tight defense on curry but he'll still get his good looks.  He was just cold tonight.  The one shot he made was not a good look, but he regularly makes those too.  There is no bad shot for curry.  `\Do you really think so?`\My bad fam! ��`\Pre all star break he was shooting 39.3% fg and 34.8% from 3. After asb he's shooting 50%fg and 38.5% from 3.

I think it says more about BPM as a stat and who DLee was playing against.`\The defense was great.

However he was 1-12 from 3, and he usually regularly makes contested and off-balance 3s.

He goes 3-12, which would still be much worse than his usual shooting, Klay goes 2-7 instead of 1-7 and they win it.

Given how good the Spurs played in defense, this was a lot closer than it should have been.

It will be a thrilling playoff series if it happens. Let's see what happens. `\Just checked in.

* Backcourt A : 1/18 from 3

* Backcourt B : 7/13 from 3

On a serious note, Russell/Clarkson is going to be a terrific pairing, they can switch all off ball screens, etc. Also I really liked their aggressiveness in playing the passing lanes, that really seemed to get the Warriors' backcourt out of rhythm.

I'm not sure about Randle, but he has to develop a passable jumper. If Draymond can literally stand in the restricted area when Clarkson has the ball in the corner (because he's guarding Randle, who's at the FT line), that's not going to be playable in the playoffs in a couple of seasons. I do love watching him hustle on defense and working the glass though, that's fun.

I like that young core from the Lakers (assuming they don't give Phila their pick this year)

edit: grammar`\Huertas is G.O.A.T. `\Clippers are not good, whats new`\What a ducking joke `\Does Draymond ever shut up? Jesus.`\the all star family `\My sorry ass attempt at sarcasm. `\Shit's busted.`\The problem is that with the constant Spurs switches, Parker often gets pushed onto a bigger and stronger player. He's been doing a decent job, but I think in general, Parker just isn't lengthy enough.

Every Spur, other than Parker and Manu (and maybe Mills) can cover more than one position. Parker can only guard the smallest person.`\Okay, I'm ready for the playoffs to start.

They are the clear #2 in the league right now, and also having a historically great season, and we know they can beat the Warriors. And they play twice, once in San Antonio, and another time on no rest for the Warriors. It's entirely possible the Warriors lose both those games, and if that happens, they need to win out the other 6, which is scary.

If the Warriors go 1-1 against the Spurs, I think the record is a lock.`\#KLAY MORE FG ATTEMPTS THAN POINTS`\BDD always helping us`\What is this a reference to? I know he was in the Braves. `\I decided to play nba2k14 with updated rosters.

GAAAHHHH!!! it's too intense!`\Two big takeaways:

Spurs team defense was amazing: I don't think I witnessed a single Klay or Curry 3 point attempt that they could settle in. All of it was quick released or contested. Very good effort.

Warriors: Despite missing Bogut, Ezeli, and Iguadala and Klay/Curry having a crazy off night/getting shutdown by Spurs defense, the final score was only 8 points away.

Well, according to 538's Elo rankings, they are now 16 Elo points behind the Spurs. Sure, they estimate the average home court advantage to be about 92 points, and they estimate the Jazz to win at home with 2.5 points over the Hawks, who is about 40 points worse in that game. But still, that means the Spurs are about 0.5 point per game on neutral ground better than the Warriors`\What did Steph do last night `\No. You can have the sports package in addition to the standard.`\No offense without Kawhi or LMA `\Prob gameplan.

Being matched up with GSW, SAS, OKC, and LAC are good match ups.

* GSW: Good matchup, low winning chance, but a good test for both teams

* SAS: Good story, low chance, honestly, worse for the Blazers IMO with the clash of styles

* OKC: Division rival, high chance at an upset, seriously, if you're a fan of nail biters and drama, pray to God for this matchup

Very impressive showing from Tony.`\Spurs and Warriors used all their basketball skills up on Saturday, title's wide open now. `\Don't agree with your second point at all. Spurs defense on Curry was absolutely stifling. The defended him on the pick-on-roll down to a science and gave him no room to operate on the perimeter. They either forced him to pass or drive down the lane which is where he got most of his points. The pressed him from the minute he stepped past half court as they should and when the shot clock was winding down and he had the ball, they defended him even tougher and forced him to take an ugly shot or pass it up. In theory, this is the perfect way to defend Curry, but not every team is as defensively sound as the Spurs nor do every team have Pop. `\There is also this thing called reddit to talk shit and give people a hard time on.

I hate the stupid fucking loud fanbase and all the LA Warriors fans that go around like they've given a fuck for more than 3 years and can't recognize the term "we believe".

That being said, after watching this team for 2 years, there are times when they just execute at a level I've never seen in my life. I hate them for that but they're really fucking good regardless.`\He doesn't regularly do that, it's only happened 4 times this season. He has more games shooting at .500 and above from 3-point range (19) than games shooting at .250 or below (18). He had more than 5 attempts in only half of those bad games, while taking more than 5 threes in 15 of those games where he had a high three point percentage.

I don't think that there's really all that much behind these inconsistency claims. It's just that he's a player who relies on his shooting and there are going to be off nights, but he doesn't actually have those too often. It's just that when you watch the Warriors, you see the shit that Curry does and it's easy to forget how well Thompson shoots the ball each night. `\The Kobe. `\Kobe will play better than his last game vs golden state.

I think they have the best offensive rating by the starting 5 after the All Star break `\neither one.  they're neutral.
`\It's already started `\Thompson is unreal when he's on`\Damn, Dallas dance girls are fire`\Kawhi gonna drive his Tahoe to Bdubs to celebrate`\Danny blocks curry`\If it bleeds, it can die.`\I think they just have not worked on dealing with opposing defenses without Curry as much as they could have. We've seen tonight how clutch they can be when the necessity arises; honing the offense to the strengths of the team without Curry will take time, but I'm sure they could figure it out.`\3 is huge...`\Aha, so there is the classic post-Warriors loss overreaction`\I'm beginning to think the reason small ball works is that you can hack the shit out of big guys and refs will never call it. It's the Shaq Principle.`\Chirp`\Yeah, he's turning it over a bit `\Unpopular opinion but I find this game rather enjoyable`\i'm scared`\Towns knows he's not supposed to be angled like that but I guarantee you dumbass sam mitchell told him to take away the corner from Curry cause Mitchell is a fucking idiot`\have no clue wht game ur talking about? as far as i know tht game never happened x_x`\I feel like some Clippers have stockholm syndrome or something with Austin Rivers.

CP and Reddick hurt this team more than Austin Rivers lol? Are you kidding me? CP and Reddick demand attention and create plays more than Austin ever can. Him playing in the 4th quarter made this game out of reach for them. He is useless out there. He's not worth passing to and when he controls the ball he doesn't do anything smart with the ball. I mean there was a play in the middle of the 4th where they went to the small ball lineup and Austin brought the ball up and CP3 was playing off guard and all I could think was "Thank God." The defense just goes "Well, Austin will probably fuck this up so let's let him run to the rim and flail around." Sure he can defend people at times because of his size but he still doesn't do it intelligently.

This is coming from a Warriors fan. Austin Rivers does not deserve those minutes on an upper half Western Conference team. I wouldn't complain as much if he was on a shittier team but PLEASE his play time is inexplicable and when people don't see how bad he is it blows my mind. `\God damn right `\Damn that last W!!!!!`\Klay never does well when his dad is there`\Boy I bet you wish you could say that more :D`\If the Lakers win, this would be the largest difference in winning percentage in NBA history.`\Wow, first sub .200 team win against a .900 team lol

Its a great game for Pop to try our small lineups.`\Steph CHUCKERy`\You need 4 other good defenders for that to work`\They made us nervous, but in the end the Suns pulled it off like we all knew they could.

Didn't hurt our chances at the #1 pick, and our young players (Len, Booker) played great. I'll gladly take this over all the blowout losses.

Curry is goddamn amazing too.`\Good d`\Two in a row for Klay. `\Lakers > Clippers`\how many Warriors jerseys are going up on eBay tonight? time to dust off that Kobe jersey.`\There was a light shuffle.

The Spurs shine in the 4th quarter. Who knows..they could've brought the game within 8 by the end of the game. They didn't because Pop knows regular season games don't matter much but if it were the playoffs, I guarantee it wouldn't be a 30pt blowout `\christmas day 2014 never forget`\Those fake cuts wouldn't really be effective if, say, a normal point guard was executing it.

What I'm saying is, unlike "cuckold", I have never heard "cuck" used in a way that wasn't racially loaded. And sports is generally/historically an arena/context where racially loaded insults are not rare by any means.

My point is only that people using the word should be aware of its predominant meaning (and, like other vile slurs, seeing it used casually/ignorantly takes some of the fun out of well-meaning sports shit-talking). `\Lakers are winning against Golden State.

Charlotte had SEVEN points in the first quarter. Insane. `\Awful passing from spurs the turnovers almost got them there. `\His suits are terrible. `\Ain't just Warriors fans downvoting you, friend.

Really hate Randle, I don't like his game at all. He's too selfish.`\For the past month, yes`\Sweet jesus Klay... can we feed him the ball, please?

Twisting your mind and smashing your dreams

Blinded by me, you can't see a thing

Just call my name, 'cause I'll hear you scream

Stephen

Stephen`\Couldn't have said it any better myself.`\Steph's new NBA? What a joke `\Finally have a good game and they are just bullshitting on their 3 pointers `\Down 6, I'll definitely take it.`\Looks like they're getting locked down pretty hard as well, thanks for the smart analysis though!`\jesus lma is feasting`\As a playoff barometer, I like the Dubs' chances. The Spurs still turn over the ball too much and considering how close the game is without Curry being off from 3, the game was close.
Good game but I'm glad we didn't get blown out.`\Your coach is shit.`\Agreed`\WHO NEEDS CURRY WHEN RUBIO SPOTS UP`\A Beautiful, Cranky Mind`\Post all-star, yes.`\By who?`\God fucking damn it, man.`\A very boyish looking beast but a beast nonetheless`\But when do we give credit to SA for shutting them down? `\Trying to drive down HB's next contract`\How many technicals were called in this game? At least 3 right?`\Randle is not trash? Ok then...`\Depends on draft spot.  Hopefully a good PF but BPA.`\Sorry *GINO

`\Danny Green has 3 blocks on Curry damn`\Oh wow.`\Warriors played without Ezeli, Iggy or Bogut tonight.

Both teams at full strength, I just don't see the Warriors losing in a 7 game series. Warriors were missing 3 big players and stuck around. Spurs missed 1 and got annihilated.

`\This guy gets it. Get into sports writing, bro.`\penis`\"Hibbert's a good shot blocker". `\That's a makeup call for lots of missed calls vs the Lakers`\I love how cordial this thread is now but let there be a last second flagrant to end the game and watch this turn into Normandy. `\Except I'm home by myself

Yeah I get that defenses are trying to clamp down on AD, but they could at least try to get him the ball more than three times a quarter.`\lol`\Keep the lead at 20!`\Twolves are so fun to watch. `\Eww look at those East coast standings with their double digit losses lol`\Not an excuse it's stating a fact. If you would like to poiint out the contradiction be my guest and try.`\It's ok when he was drafted Spurs fans were calling Bruce Bowen without the ability to hit the corner 3.`\Mo speights and david west are twins`\Shit what happened? Did someone bump into him or awkward landing?`\gawd damn curry got shut down this game`\Isn't part of the point they won't be scoring 79 points a game if he's on the team?

I do think Durant is going to be about winning a championship as much as anything else, including points he can score or how much he'll get paid. `\Lmao we circlejerk now `\Are you psychic?`\Warriors pulled starters at like 9 minutes in that game. Blazers pulled starters at 6 or 7 minutes. Dame just scored a lot in that span.

This game, Klay, Steph, and Dray were all in during the 4th when Blazers had put in the bench the full 4th quarter.

Quit bitching about "running up the score" and just enjoy your dominant team.`\I still know how to spell and notice when I misspell words when I'm drunk.

truly the dankest timeline`\so many bad calls`\Don't, don't do that...`\Still excusing? Lame`\Nice Defense Nick -__-`\Michigan State losing.`\Those offensive rebounds sealed the game.  Bugut and Ezeli were clearly missed. And that spurs defense? Goddamn.

Kawhi dpoy. `\Is there any good live box scores? ESPN's is broken`\Damn Lakers overachieving and shit. `\Curry / Klay. Atrocious game from both`\Curry jumped into Wiggins`\Yeah, you're right. How dare the home fans chant in support of a guy that would be the run away MVP if it wasn't for a guy having possibly the best season ever.`\I'll probably post breakdowns at the end of the 3rd`\Look at Pop pretending like the refs haven't been giving him gifts all night.`\Oh yea forgot, she's waiting in my bedroom `\Well fuck. Played hard but just shot awful. And Bogut being out hurt big time, especially with stopping LMA. Props to the Spurs.`\fuck man ):`\Don't worry.  We all have bad seasons.*

*almost all`\i highly doubt we pay him that much...if someone offers him that much i believe the FO will let him walk...and honestly i wouldn't mind with how he's played.`\lol dont count on it, Lakers usually fall apart during the 3rd quarter`\Nice.`\Well fuck the Warriors are gonna take this out on us tomorrow. `\if he could be consistent like Manu, I'd take that in a heart beat. He certainly pisses off other teams like Manu seems to find a way to kill us`\I still don't see how any team beats the Dubs 4 out of 7 times.

He's going to be amazing off the bench.

And this is a very nice rebound game for D'LO after the horrible game he had versus Atlanta.

My first NBA game that I ever attended was Mavs vs Spurs. This was back in the Dirk/Nash/Finley Era and I was in 3rd grade. I went to the game with my cousins. As you would imagine I'm was very excited to be attending my first NBA.  Had the unfortunate luck of sitting near a very shitty Spurs' fan. This fan came to the game by herself and would talk shit to me anytime I cheered for the Mavs until my cousins told her to back the fuck off. This was a grown Ass women BTW. Hated everything Spurs related  ever since

Edit: the Mavs also lost the game to top it off `\Why the eff did Green leave his feet there?`\Warriors always decide to turn it up when they need to. Anybody who thinks they'll lose in a 7 game series is off in the head`\You just named one good play, when I can name 3 more where he screwed up. Austin also let Curry outrun him from and inbounds in the backcourt, for an easy layup. He even held his hands up trying to blame someone else (maybe green?) for not covering his man.

His defense is overrated. If anything, I think his offense tonight was slightly better than average. But that's only because he is getting so many minutes.

Why is Austin covering Curry? I think DJ did a better job on Curry than Austin. `\We should get a trophy for this lol.`\A guy named Marcelo Huertas outplayed the MVP today.

Cus I will take those odds to the bank every time`\Did I put on the All-Star game?`\no it's 44-47`\Murray... Ehh. I was optimistic but he was quoting saying he doesn't feel qualified to break down build and then build a shot from scratch. So I'm debating whether he's gonna be worth anything.

Honestly a lot of shot doctors aren't necessarily former players so I'm not sure how good he'll be.

I missed the first quarter, did Byron really have Russell guarding Barnes? Yikes `\You must be new here. `\Dray jacking up threes... bricking`\Shut the fuck up, Stephen A Smith.`\The game would've had a completely different flow if Dirk was on the floor. This was a good old shootout. `\so who is gonna give Mo a max deal?`\I'm so irrationally angry that the Suns blew that game, it was so fucking winnable and they did absolutely everything wrong.

Let's start at the beginning of the fourth quarter. Two major keys the Suns immediately fucked up on. The first is when the home team goes on a quick run, slow the game down as much as possible and move the ball a ton. It gets the crowd out of the game as much as possible, which is super important against the Warriors especially. The Suns started panicking and taking bad shots.

The second is when the opponent's best player and key to the offense is in foul trouble, you attack him and you get him out of the game. Curry was guarding Ronnie Price (which is already a mistake, get Knight back in there after that quarter, even if he's a little tired). Even if it costs you a couple bad shots trying to draw it, attack Curry non-stop. Don't screen, pass the ball to the guy Curry's on and that guy immediately drive to the bucket and try and draw the foul. If you can get that 5th foul and force Curry out of the game it's worth those 5 lost possessions. Especially when you're not running plays for those possessions anyways.

Next up, Mareese Speights. I get it, he had his best game in a long and you're playing percentages. But at point 15, it's not percentages anymore, it's a hot hand. Leave someone else open. Barnes was 0-3 from deep, leave him, or leave one big in the paint and step out on Speights. I know Curry is hard to guard, but leave someone else open.

Then there's the alley-"oops". Brandon Knight seemed to think the Suns were the showtime Lakers in the second half. There were a few problems to this. The biggest one is that Brandon Knight's probably the worst lobber I have ever seen. He threw one of them at the top of the backboard at like 80 mph. How is an aging Tyson Chandler going to get that?

There was also the PnR defense. I know that Curry-Green PnR is almost impossible to guard, but rule #1 on it is don't leave Steph open for 3. I don't know who taught Brandon Knight and Ronnie Price how to run through screens, but whoever it was needs to be [banned from basketball.](http://i.imgur.com/UjWMjo2.gif) I mean JESUS CHRIST, at 40 feet out you do not try to run straight into the screen. Somebody probably told them to never go under on Curry screens, but that is NOT what they meant. Go under it, live with Curry shooting from 30. Some of you may say "But Curry's automatic from 30!". No, Stephen Curry is around 40% from there, and that's on wide open looks. When the alternative is a wide open 3 from 23 feet, you take the wide open 30 every single time.

Lastly, posting up. What in the actual fuck was that. Oh we have Brandon Knight having his best game in over a year, certainly his best game since he came to our team, why don't we just give the ball to post up master Tyson Chandler instead though? WHAT? Or Alex Len trying to draw fouls in the paint against the Warriors. Like, has Earl Watson never seen the Warriors play or something? Because you don't get foul calls against the Warriors in the paint, no matter what. Move the ball, set screens, get solid looks.

I know I shouldn't even care about this game but jesus that was so winnable. Knight played incredibly, Len was money, and Booker is gonna be a heck of a player, but jesus christ Suns.`\D is finally loading `\GSW did win in San Antonio during the playoffs `\That was a bad call but oh well not the reason we are going to lose.`\Very fitting for Kobe's last game against the Warriors ends in a win `\As much as i wanna see my dubs vs spurs in the playoffs, Clippers vs Grizz is the main one i wanna see.

Check my comment history`\wat`\WTF am I watching?`\I don't think this team gets nervous about regular season games.`\Wow, that shoulda been good. Don't like the and one off the ball call but the shot should count. `\Damn Yam is a legit 3 threat`\Did everyone else hold their breath expecting Curry to make that?`\Curry getting superstar calls `\lmao green`\stop youre making raptors fans look bad`\Timeout.. who's ready for Curry highlights?

Desert = not a fun place to be..  single "S"..  one is more than enough

But why can't you just freaking admit that being the second game of a road back-to-back while missing some key players may have been the difference?

There's a lot of empiracle evidence that being on the road the second game of a back-to-back results in more loses:

https://rotogrinders.com/lessons/nba-back-to-backs-209256

The Bucks beat the Warriors this year in such a scenario, in fact (well actually, the Warriors didn't have as many injuries when they lost to the Bucks).

But overall, it can be both, you know, that the Spurs played well enough to win and that in a more neutral scenario, the warriors may still have won. `\I hated the damn bobcats`\Kobe a great comedian.`\Bad day at the office boys`\Cmon Wes! `\splash bros playing like dry bros `\need to cut down those turnovers man...stop forcing passes that aren't there lol`\Beautiful steal.

I realize what makes Yams so weird. He's like a 280-pound ball of yams who won't be pushed hard enough to fall when a small guy drives into him, goes and splashes a spot-up three, comes back and doesn't crash the boards on an outside shot, misses a layup.

I think Curry has earned the right to shoot himself out of the slump.

Maybe C vs B game. If Curry or Klay weren't playing so bad I think it would have been a different result. `\To the Warriors credit they kept it close at times during the game with virtually no inside game, getting hounded on defense by the Spurs all night and trying to defend LMA and Diaw with undersized players like Green, Barnes and Varejao who's a negative every time he steps onto the floor.

You guys were really missing Bogut and Iggy.

Last time we lost by 30 points and we made one change since then swapping West for Diaw (Duncan didn't play last time either) for just an 8 point win.

please tell me with the players we currently have how Wittman could do much better? perhaps you don't realize what this season is all about... saving cap space so when the huge salary cap increase occurs we have a shot to get anyone, including my prayer player KD. amazing defense performance against the warriors and if not for Sessions stupid mistake at end of both quarters would be a much different game. He has done the best with what he has and has changed his coaching style after last year. I would like to hear some insight rather than personal attacks as to why Wittman's schemes and coaching are causing the losses if you can provide it`\Give us a break, we're old!`\First one he hi-5'ed was Steve Kerr too.

Also, Warriors can't rebound for shit with Bogut not out there. `\Good game `\Your defense was legit no discounting that. Can you honestly say it feels good man to barely beat this team coming off a back to back, without 2 playoff starters, and a key reserve all the while at home. If I'm on the Spurs, they took care of businesses but made a negative statement.

Law of averages is real ?`\What a game. Boris was man handling Barnes whenever he had the chance.  He really set the pace in literally the first few minutes. Charles Barkley was saying how to not try to fight the Warriors the way they want to be fought, which is what they tried to do in the first game with the run and gun 1st quarter. But this was a war of attrition and LMA was a beast late game.

One of the most hard fought evenly matched games (regular season) I can remember. Neither team wanted to lose.`\You only need to bet $250 to win a cent. It's a great deal.`\Is your last name Patel?`\I blame this  whole loss on the fact that they went to Tyson Chandler on the post.

OH JUST SHOOT ME SAM MITCHELL `\# Spurs in 7. `\BEST BOT EVER `\:-)`\I think the point guard depth helps the Mavs at least deal with Curry, and their lack of front court depth limits how much they can exploit the Mavs biggest weakness.  `\But he did shoot bad in a big game because he was impacted by the D. Nothing of that takes anything away from Curry, but he was shown his limits as a shooter and because of his size as he cannot post up. The pressure on D adds up on a shooter. THAT'S why Curry was forced into an "off night". How bad did he shoot in the previous back to back games against the Magic or whoever? Got the stats, if you care to prove your point?`\Hibbert with that hustle boy`\varejao sucks rn`\MY BUTTHOLE HAS BEEN CLENCHED SO TIGHT TONIGHT. GOD DAMNIT THAT WAS SUCH A GOOD GAME. RESPECT TO BOTH TEAMS, GREAT PLAY ALL AROUND.

GSG THE STREAK CONTINUES `\So much salt with these Warriors fans lol`\What fight is this picture from?`\The Golden State Warriors defeat a Dirk-less Dallas Mavericks. `\Yeah but that's more out need, Portland's frontcourt is still really raw. If they had Wiggins last offseason I think it's likely they would have gone after a more traditional power forward, although Aminu would still be a fantastic reserve so maybe they still go that route.

Or maybe they just keep Batum idk.`\not illegal screen, but holding and pushing after the screen. i dont count every illegal screen, only where there's excessive holding.


touch foul? no, i am talking hacks on the arm, things that actually affect the shot `\[How great is our God?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iY9HjNWbJvA)`\To be fair though, both teams are fouling the living shit out of each other`\Livingston is a sick basketball player.`\I offer up my meager game to the basketball gods, gimp my shot, but give it back to Curry and the Warriors.

That's great!`\why is this game such low scoring I mean only 76 points?`\Speights Effect.`\There is a precedent`\That was dunk contest worthy`\Actually the biggest upset ever. `\# WE ARE ALL WITNESS`\Ya I know, seriously why nationally televise a game where you know one team is gonna get blown out?

That's what I mean. Steph had a bad game, Klay had a bad game, we couldn't rebound for a lick, committed dumb ass turnovers again, and again. Ugly victory. `\Last year it was iggy on Lebron `\Tuned in at the last half of the second quarter.

USA! `\And yet he still missed 2 out of 3.`\47-1 in fast break points and the game was still close. That's pretty crazy.`\he was talking about the year in general with those examples`\Hawks D is pretty dope though`\Yeah because a dude can jump on an opponent's back and have the guy underneath be the one that fouled.

Charlie V literally had his arms broken in front of the ref and they no called that shit. `\man the early lead from us has shaken them`\The Warriors are actually going to lose this game, aren't they?`\goddamn, kerr heated`\MCADOO SLAM`\Damn, that's amazing defense. `\That was clearly warriors ball.`\the refball is real.

If both him and Curry can do it, the dubs become invincible.`\Well that last one to be fair he had to take of we were gonna have a sniff of a chance.`\I'm obviously glad we won, but what a fantastic game `\Tell me, do you bleed?

`\God Mitchell is a shit coach. `\It's in the true warrior fans blood to believe that it's all going to go to shit.

I'm not sure how to break this to you...`\Watching the Mavs broadcast as a warriors fan, I enjoy them more than fitz.`\NO FOUL`\I try to avoid complaining, but.....

Only the Spurs are a great team this season.  I think it's fair to say that GS having an off night, or the other team playing out of its mind, has been a big part of each their losses.  How many wins can you imagine each of these teams taking in a 7-game series?  Can you imagine any team besides the Spurs having a chance of getting four?`\This better be good.

He's finding himself shooting near the 3 point line a lot, and Mills is money from that range.`\JMM on the glass!`\I seriously doubt my liver would survive.`\Trying to do too much fancy shit`\This game is fucking intense. `\Rubio has been the Best player on the court today. `\Barnes used to be clutch in close 4th quarters `\Yeah I agree with keeping Barnes simply due to 1) chemistry and 2) finances. Now, the difference between a max for HB and potentially a close to max deal with KD is negligible but is that likely to happen? Dunno. Also, with HB, he is still young and developing. How much more can he develop as a role player as opposed to being a main option on a different team is debatable. My decision ultimately rests on whether or not Durant wants to be a Warrior.

The one he made was a chuck if I've ever seen one.
Total props to the Spurs defending him tonight. `\But they were shooting poorly for a reason..`\Do you know how many times we've heard the warriors are a only a jump shooting team? `\Remember when people doubted DLo after like 10 games lol`\Yes "...ignore the other 81"`\[The rarest Pokemon of them all](http://imgur.com/z1E4FN1)`\And none of them have been super clean haha`\Lol always some excuse.`\Damn, they're going to beat the record aren't they?`\"I'm a donkey, Steph!"

I think Clarkson is going to be a more reliable player than Russell.`\Lakers sitting in the passing lanes and getting out on the break.

I wish I could ship Jim and Pam all over again.

Plus DWIGHT`\I'm just an NBA fan, my take: Perfect game played by the spurs, a bunch of open shots missed by GS, no iguadola or bogut. Warriors in 5.`\fade those flairs`\It wasn't resting Duncan. He can't play defense at that speed anymore. They're better with Duncan off the floor in this matchup`\Uh, how many 40+ point games Curry gave up on his man this year?

If he improves his defense, he could be the best in this league. I'd rather be bad on defense than offense and he's got a lot of it.`\Wow that's impressive`\omg they might lose. im so excited`\That's still a fresh wound for some of us...`\https://streamable.com/romy`\Curry just wanted to play with him; split a ligament or two.`\These past 4 games or so have been beautiful to watch; hell even the Hawks game wasn't that bad because our shots just didn't go down.


The amount of passing we've done is just a thing of beauty to watch; having Lou Williams getting injured and Huertas playing extensive minutes is a blessing in disguise for us.`\Patty don't RUN AWAY FROM THE GUY WITH THE BALL`\steph so fucking cold lol

On the high pick and rolls, off the offensive glass, inside D. The drop-off from Bogut to McAdoo is enormous`\GG on defense, its possible if Curry is on a the road to a back to back and the Spurs have a full day of rest, but don't act like a 30 point loss never happened, or that the sky in San Antonio wouldn't be falling if the Warriors won shorthanded.

Cmon.`\Back to .9 at least
`\Exactly. Lue took our winning formula and started doing the opposite. Now we're a fast-paced team and went from 3rd in defensive efficiency to 8th.

That was not a pass.`\Lmao still more banners than the clippers `\Nice dime HB`\Either that or GINOBILI

`\Yeah it was, the refs have had some questionable calls both ways tonight! I'm calling it even for now`\Tony Parker has stealthily transformed into a rather potent 3-point shooter, especially lethal from the corner.`\Pretty standard for us`\No one : The Refs`\2002 Lakers still win.`\Put in Klay to shut down dangelo`\Lol yeah it seemed like it.

It's a b2b on the road for OKC, and GSW is tough as shit at home even short-handed.`\Millsap literally built a wall with his a fourth quarter bricks`\They play in different conferences, so it's always gonna be two games.`\Barnes has gone from trying to get max money to ANY amount of money next year.`\The moment you realize how cool Jalen Rose is`\- Klay Thompson`\Good defense, especially with the help man stealing the ball in the post.`\Lollll whatever you say`\ask him if the pubes on his chin are effecting his game`\in Steph we trust

any time now Steph`\Downvote me because I'm a salty little bitch`\Dude that was so dumb. Why do you burn your last time out AND tell your player to purposely miss the last free throw? Could have just made it, be down 2, foul, hope GSW misses one, call time out and go for a 3 to tie. Even if GSW makes both free throws, Wolves can call time out, advance the ball, get a quick 2 and hope for a steal. Burning the last time out for no apparent reason killed any chance Wolves had left. `\You still seem to think the Spurs just happened to have a bad game offensively, all by themselves.

Seriously though, SA really stepped up its bar scene the last 4-5 years.  I grew up there and still go back a lot and it legit was kinda boring in that regard until about 2011-2012.  Now there's a lot of great areas to go out.

Also we've always had a bunch of awesome patio restaurants that are just awesome to sit around for a long Tex-Mex dinner with margs.  That's kinda our quintessential deal.`\But Klay was 5/5 tonight on 3's compared to Curry who was 2/9?`\Credit to MVP Dray`\Really tragic because that was the type of play that could be featured in the defensive highlight videos that kids in 20 years watch to learn about  Kawhi's defense. Like that wasn't just a steal for a dunk that makes it onto sportscenter. It featured everything that makes Kawhi a great defender, including his technique, instincts, and physical prowess. And he did it while guarding the best player in the game.... but the refs called a bogus foul so it's like it never happened. `\Cute God &lt;3 !!!!!



\#1 with Cute and heart`\May seem obvious, but this Lakers team should be losing as many games as possible to catch up with the Sixers. 50something% chance of losing the pick is significantly worse than a 60something% chance.

I don't care if everyone says that Bulls team or Celtics are better than this Warriors team. The fact that they even compared a team to those legendary teams is what makes this awesome.

You gotta admit, the Warriors kinda lucked out with an owner who became poor and sold it to the perfect one. Some fans aren't as lucky as they'll be stuck with inept owners who meddle too much or don't give enough of a crap. `\If you watched the game you should have known`\Nobody gives a fuck about the NBA.`\Both teams played a damn good game. `\You sure talk big for only being a fan of your team for 10 months`\That's where Tom should stay `\Yeah, very true.

Is he that bad?`\This game thread is a hate-filled toxic wasteland, lol`\It depends on the odds. There will usually be a number like -110 (for spread) or +100. -110 mean you need to bet $110 to win $100. +100 means you need to bet $100 to win $100. Moneyline can range. The lowest payout I can find for the GSW was -25000 which means bet $25000 to win $100.

Spurs are 5-13`\Curry 4-14, Klay 5-15... 2/13 from 3 combined.

That competitive Mavs game really messed them up.`\He washes his hands before he flushes.`\devil came back for his soul`\Klay knocked the ball loose. Though I can't fathom the ref actually being able to see that... `\His body is Taylor made for the sport. `\T that fuccboi up `\best way to get out of a slump is to keep shooting. He's the best player in the world and he makes that shot on the reg. I have no problem with it.`\Wiggins pulls off an amazing rebound on one end, and then does that on the other?

`\This could be an entertaining series...`\That's not really a useful thing to say though, because the Warriors played terribly by their standards.`\At least he has a great attitude and he's humble.`\GOD DAMMIT RANDLE `\We got to play for real now tho`\That was a sweet NBA Jam commercial though`\Lee's revenge game so far been great`\As the game approaches the 4th, the salt is gonna reach Dead Sea levels real soon`\he's just saving the best for 2mrw `\Bring on the Robots!`\He missed 20 on the bucks`\He focused on getting them to speed up the offense and ball movement.  It leaves them tired on defense. He's trying to improve their conditioning. `\Your mad the Lakers were having fun during the biggest upset in league history, their largest win of the season, and their best game of the year?`\LETS FUCKING GOOOOO `\We all know if Leonard were Curry, he'd have gotten freethrows there`\Have you seen his defence?`\Lol thats an offensive foul?`\Didn't do much of that tonight. When he isn't making 3s, his impact is that of a role player.`\I don't think the warriors are built for these slow grind games, if you can slow the pace and play exceptionally great defense, you got a good chance`\Warriors 3 ball is pretty constant as well lol`\playoffs are gonna be fun sure, nice highlights, maybe a few game 7 series, some buzzer beaters, etc but warriors gonna be holdin the larry o brien in june (sorry spurs)`\Russell turned around before it went in`\His offense is his defense. `\thanks`\i like big penis in my mouth`\March Madness was on ABC tonight `\I didn't say they did? And it was a joke.`\Yup, I think both team's fans have reasons to be happy about the way the game went. Spurs got the W, but the Warriors competed on a back to back away game with very important players injured and generally made things very difficult for the Spurs. To me, even though the Spurs got the W I think its still apparent that the Warriors would be favored in a 7 game series, but each game will no doubt be a grindfest. `\Things Maresse Speights and Bartolo Colon have in common:

- Both have funny names

- Both casually defy the laws of physics and/or rational thought and continually show the propensity to push the envelope on what we once thought to be the limit of human achievement in the arena of sport on a nightly basis

- Both occasionally need translators during postgame interviews

yep, comparison checks out`\Staples would have collectively ejaculated if Kobe yammed that`\Yeah wtf is he doing shooting wide open threes`\lakers about to win out the rest of the season off being pumped from this game alone`\Not winning anything with 13% 3FG & 20TO. Better team won.`\/r/nevertellmetheodds `\mavs commentators complain too? didn't realize`\Those are just good old grit 'n grind basketball, unlike Golden State's dirty moving screens.`\Why can Curry shred a defensive team and then it's just a fluke because he has one poor half against a good defense?`\because it's sterile and I like the taste`\Can we bloody keep the ball?`\This is honestly a game Golden State should have lost had the calls been more even.`\:( `\no`\Warriors shot 10% from 3, Lakers shot 40%.

Goddamnit`\What's on over there??`\and theyre only down one, should be a great game`\Warriors had this same halftime show last game lol`\upvote for visibility `\Danny's defense has been so good.`\I remember earlier spurs fans complaining about draymond putting his hands on LMA....man kwahi does that all day more than anyone`\http://espn.go.com/watchespn/player/_/id/2758606/`\Missed shots we normally make, too make it close when Klay/Steph shoot this bad is fine. `\You'd think with Wes guarding him he wouldn't`\Bench plus unbelievable performance from Dallas to come back. Bench missed a lot of open 3s and easy layups, it was really hard to watch at times. Dallas meanwhile just kept making 3s. Kerr probably left the bench out there a little longer than he should have, making the game closer than it should be.`\Without bogut we will have our matchups problems too. `\you really can't. his reach is insane `\Curry missing layups, what is going on ?`\fucking refs giving minny every soft call`\Because it's impossible, they can only tie it`\Lol`\Damn Tony parker played defense that i never thought possible from him`\Imagine the Spurs on the 2nd night of a back to back...Pop would've sat out half the team lol. Dubs got this.`\And then they have to steal. And if they don't, they're probably down 4 with like 5 seconds and have to make 2 3s with one timeout.

Not happening.`\okay u need to become a hermit asap`\When the Nets went 0-18, no team wanted to be the first to lose to them so we always got everyone's A-game. So in a way, I know exactly what you mean.`\Never said the Mavs were going to beat the W's in a series. Said its not impossible for us to take two from you in a series.

And it doesn't matter if Curry was in that game or not that night. Every team has injuries. Basketball isn't a one man show, its about a team. Still counts as an L on your record. `\When was the last time we lost the first quarter?`\your posts are really annoying you stupid fuck`\Clark must look awesome in practice or something cause he always plays like booty in game. `\If I was a GSW fan, I'd be ecstatic to be down six. They were outplayed and can't hit anything from the field.`\Steph Curry likes curry`\Just resting. Pop wants to see what the team can do without Old Man Riverwalk bailing them out. `\[TAKE US HOME KAWAII!](https://streamable.com/19ym)`\NOT YET!`\Wiggins needs to stop trying to play hero ball. He had KAT open rolling down the lane but passed it up for a contested turn around jumper...`\also post up long 2's are due to the personnel that we have more than Whitman's coaching. I think we didn't spend much knowing this huge increase in salary cap is coming up and this offseason will be amazing. KD COME HOME!!!!`\I'm unable to see the game. I keep seeing layup and dunks for the Lakers, are the Warriors not playing any D at all?`\Some dumb team will give it to him too`\GG`\        Lakers > Lakers && Lakers < Lakers
    <=> Lakers = Lakers

I love Mavs players intro music`\Everyone, meet at the four corners monument.`\Wiggins definitely seemed to crumble under the pressure :/`\oh shit dude that's aggressive, hope you drink some water or else you're in for one hell of a headache tomorrow.  Those fuckers are thick and syrupy `\Its empty advice, pay it no mind`\Dubs look tremendously sluggish. Lakers just look like the Lakers. `\Da fuck is going on`\Klay what is wrong with you`\Curry is 1/10 Klay is 0/8`\At the beginning of this day I was like "why the fuck are lakers playing the dubs on national tv for the 10th time, its gonna suck"... Lakers you have made my day, now get the win! `\Do u guys think Durant is watching right now and thinking "so this is how I beat the Warriors..." ????`\fuck bogut's out of this game with a toe injury. probably won't play tomorrow against the Spurs `\Can anyone explain why Klay didn't get called for a foul for posting up the smaller Patty Mills?`\100 year old reference ftw`\Just stopping by to say you guys are creating history one day at a time and it's been an honor to watch it all happen. Even my mom and girlfriend are interested in watching select regular season NBA games. This would be literally impossible unless Riley's dad was sinking 3's on a nightly basis.`\#ICE IN HIS VEINS`\mmm, churros`\He did.`\This is pathetic. `\This game does my body good`\Nah. `\No more tanking in LA!Marcelo turning this shaqtin bashing into something beautiful`\Lots of shots missed by both teams, for sure. This could easily already be in the 30's for both teams.`\What streak?`\hind sight is 20/20`\He is horrible. `\We need Bogut badly `\Or maybe... They should do something about all the threes the entire team is taking. Swear to god man, on every Warriors possession in the 1st half, three shooters would wait along the arc and just keep swinging the ball around until one of them got an open look. It was like watching a college game.`\I don't ever know how to feel about brandon knight and this game certainly didn't help`\[I can see why you thought of Terry Crews](https://youtu.be/-RNG_tTXXcg)`\Come on, Commander Scott!

Idiot. `\That last Curry 3 was horrendous.

I could see Draymond hesitation to shoot being a issue in the playoffs, a couple of the times he looked like DeAndre on the free throw line when he had  good looks. Really allowed his defender to completely back off him killing a lot of the offense.`\Saw this last night and wanna follow up now. How ya feeling, buddy?`\If you're Bogut you can't be attempting backdoor passes from the top of the key when YOUR OWN MAN is 25 feet away from you breaking the pass up.

Spurs lost by 30 @ Warriors w/o only Duncan and Spurs fans cited that as a big reason for the loss.
Warriors lost by 8 @ Spurs w/o Bogut/Andre/Festus and cite that as a reason for the loss.
Both teams haven't played each other at full strength. Either way both teams are playing historic basketball right now and are fun to watch.

Tyus Jones couldn't keep up and I feel like he needs some D-League time.

Curry needs to know and acknowledge when he has a cold night.

Seems like Carlisle brought him in and gave him a defined role at sixth man, doing what he does best instead of pussyfooting around.

A lot of them were saying that if we won, it didn't mean a damn thing. And yeah it's a meaningless regular season game, but to me it was like, "Hey if we lose, it's not our fault." I just thought that was bs. Oh well, we won! We're on to Charlotte. `\Should have gone to school for Computer Science instead of Econ`\I live in the bay area and ABC is on channel 7 over the air.

They lose one game and suddenly their style is unsustainable? Other all-time greats faced upsets when they went cold and no one says their style is unsustainable despite losing more often. The Warriors have won games where they were cold from beyond-the-arc before and also don't go that cold that often. There is literally nor eason to worry.`\stay salty my friend
`\Doesn't the ref have discretion on shot clock violations? Pretty sure he can allow the fast break to go on even if the team doesn't get possession. So all these people saying technically they didn't have the ball yet, well that doesn't matter. Tough calls. `\FREE THROWS MAN! I KNOW! IT'S KILLING MY MIND! `\2nd time. Gobert caught him first`\Entertainment wise, this is the most enjoyable sort of game.

Offensive skill vs offensive skill `\still not their true death lineup though, this one isn't nearly as good...doesn't deserve the 'death' title imo`\THIS GAME IS SOMETHING ELSE`\Blah blah see you in the playoffs sore losers`\> but it was still a 1 possession game with 2 minutes left.

And the Spurs were turning the ball over a lot more than they usually do. So does that balance out for GS's poor 3-pt percentage?

And just because GS is a great team all around, that doesn't mean that generally relying on 3-pt shots isn't an inherent risk. There are benefits, like opening up the lane, etc. beyond actually shooting a 3, which are evidenced in tonight's game. The simple *threat* of those 3-pt shots changes how teams play defense. But when your two biggest scorers are also both primarily shooting 3-pt shots, an off night hurts you worse.

If you're winning games by large margins making primarily 2-pt shots, then an off night will result in less overall missed points.

Because it was a hate-watch, I arbitrarily picked the Spurs to root for, and I gotta tell ya, it must be fun to be a Spurs fan. Danny Green is clutch as fuck.`\this I agree with.

We sat his ass from that point on. Man, the warriors did the stupidest things. Remember benching Timmy for BJ Armstrong? Or picking up Mugsy Bogues after this knees went bad?

That inexperience kept them from going to him more down the stretch and possibly cost the game, but those guys will learn and hopefully put it all together in a couple years.

Side note, but of all the games I've planned on going to, I don't think there's one I've been looking forward to more than vs. the Wolves in April.

Every team knows our small lineup, its no secret at this point.`\prolly`\Don't listen to him during a game when someone's getting hacked. It's even worse.`\Steph Curry had 0 points in the 4th quarter. Wow.`\When it's a this or that. Someone is wrong.`\my point was more that the spurs likely would have won by more if the refs actually called the warriors on these two things. why? because every warriors game I watch, the refs let them pick and hold while their shooters get open. Then they also let them hack at players in the lane. had these been called fairly, the warriors are in the bonus earlier and the spurs get more shots. The warriors either foul more at that point, or lay off on defense, creating easier shots for the spurs.

`\Don't forget about Nance! Love that kid! `\Marcelo getting that love from Hubie`\glorious spin move wasted on a miss`\Pop things.`\Playoffs bring out the most amount of salt.

About as probable as the rest of those predictions.`\Remember when D'Angelo Bustle and the Lakers fucked up by not picking Okafor?`\Whoa, how did Varejao go from on the floor on one end to grabbing the rebound on the other? Didn't even catch him running in.`\stupid pass from manu earlier too

No one likes to see this happen.`\Bogut and ezeli out does that. And Barnes in foul trouble. 8 PT loss at home completely cold with 3 men out. Good game, and u can tell Kerr played to win. `\So injuries were the only reason the Spurs won?`\Huh didn't know pointing out the obvious = victim complex.

worst of all, Dallas has ZERO fear factor versus the Warriors, they've played them tough and blown them out for one of the few losses they've taken this season... as a potential 1st round matchup, the Warriors needed to send a message... instead they sent the WRONG message`\Got back from the gym and checked game cast, thought it was broken or something.

Filthy chucker. `\A 4th quarter curry actually participated in.`\I'll hit you so hard that when you wake up, your clothes will be out of style!`\I think Harrison Barnes is going to score 15+ pts today.`\9 to by gsw only one by LAL...ayyyy`\Boris durke`\lol steph`\Huertas is going HAM this game`\Its like a Hydra, you stop one player shooting and several more rise to take their place.`\haha that was an obvious push off by Squidward's house. WTF Kerr?`\Seriously, him taking on those two defenders by himself and his half a handle was absurdist theater at its best.`\Shit we are getting killed on the boards... We need some magic today.`\FUCK THE CLIPPERS`\Bimbo Coles anyone?`\Jesus christ I just think the warriors are the better team and I thought yesterday they were still very much in the mix despite a lot of things going against them. I think a lot of those things won't be as large of a factor in a bigger sample size of games (ie the playoffs).`\Maybe this will force Kerr to go small. `\Steph tripdub too late now`\It was joke that was not thought out. I'm drunk.`\He pulled a reverse S-Livingston. 2pts 1/5 and a +\- of +25 in 17 minutes.`\I WANNA RIOT`\What? Where did you hear that?`\yeah raymond Fatton!!!`\ Refs don't call these type of stupid fouls on kawhi when he is defending LeBron or durant.`\this game is hype as fuck, loving it`\GG Spurs, congrats on 44 home wins`\At the time LMA wasn't a more deserving all-star than Lillard. He's played a lot better since the break, nobody's denying that`\Did Dlo just turn around before it went in??`\I mean yeah it was a very horrible call. do those 2 points really change the outcome of this game?`\Pop wants them all. Y'all ain't special.`\Kerr is complaining about that? the other call he complained the spurs travelled even on an obvious call. `\Bogut was limping. `\knee to knee or thigh`\Lol laker fan talking shit about losing. `\2 obvious fouls that happened directly in front of an official didn't get called on crucial plays. Fun game to watch though, this playoff series would be entertaining at least

Also Mejri got called for a travel on a play where he dribbled and Andrew Bogut literally jumped on top of him`\Watch his lowlights video and tell me someone was ALWAYS on him`\If the Warriors take home the chip this year, I'll have mad respect for what they've built and going back to back or whatever but if they do it by sweeping everyone and depriving me of close playoff basketball I'll probably hate them forever. `\Shooting bad. Not getting stops. But all it takes is one run.`\That commercial`\So lakers are the team not getting calls? That's new `\We need a Mo pick me up. Surprised he isn't in right now.`\3/28. Damn`\Looks kinda like the Birthday Party CW.`\This is still better than the red line though `\Good call`\So because we didn't have a rich fanbase that means we weren't legit fans? The regressive Texan in you is talking.`\I think he said he was proud of how well his team did despite the injuries, key missing players, playing back to back on the road and curry missing more shots than we know he will come playoffs.  Said another way San Antonio should have kicked the Warriors butts but that's not at all what happened.`\Greatest perimeter shooter of all time.`\An 11 point lead for the Warriors is like a 2 point lead for any other team`\3/29 from 3 point land for the Dubs. Damn. `\you're probably saying this as a bandwagon fan lol.`\SPEIGHTS WITH THE D!`\That might not even work if the other team hits every 3. `\Out of the six hours his mom gave birth , 4 was due to four head`\This game was porn for any Warriors haters, especially the Curry ones `\They can only tie it even with they win all their remaining games.`\Tha God. Danny motherfucking green`\As for his decision as a GSW fan to restart his slow ass PC during a game that close instead of just finding a better stream, now that we can question together. `\Fuck the FT talk, if you can't handle beans at his worst you don't deserve him at his best`\He's not terrible but if he's more than your 4th guard you're in the lottery`\Wow Byron actually coaching? He must know he's being seen on national tv`\I love our Brazilian, wish we see a better team though. He would be a great back up if we had a good defensive center and a great offense.  `\Lmao. Just wow `\Have to say, I'm happy to see the Black Mamba strike one last time (maybe) in the NBA's showcase game of the week.

And as a Sixers' fan, I'm still bummed that we didn't draft Kobe 20 years ago instead of A.I.

Bryant was a local kid and I know he was a little pissed off at the city back then but we could have made that right! The saddest words ... what could have been.`\Remember how the teams against the Warriors used to get called for fouls?`\you should hear Aussie sports men and women being interviewed, every sentence is begun or ended with a 'you know'`\I'd have to agree `\I think if you had to spend a couple days in a shitty part of Africa, you'd have a change of heart.`\I don't give a shit`\Warriors lost to the Lakers last season and went on to win the title`\We must stop the Barbamonster`\Them lucky ass white kids sitting behind the bench`\Curry had a bad night because they defended him well. `\Oh sorry. I meant the OKC game.`\I expect the Splash Brothers to put out the fire. `\Varejao dunking is so awkward. `\Showtime Lakers, baby!`\Thank you!`\Duncan didn't play in the frst game and Spurs got killed`\Shabazz must play rocket league with that attempted alley oop steal`\It will average out to the mean.`\Leonard is just such a quality threat that he knows how to create a great scoring opportunity even if that means getting to the line. `\Spunky!`\Wish Klay would have played better so people wouldn't inevitably talk shit, but he was klutch and showed some better handles/court vision than he usually gets credit for.`\Magikarp. `\Its not a big deal. It happens. I think you would rather lose a game like this when you just play poorly all around so its easier to put behind. An anomaly. An outlier game to disregard. On to the next one.`\Something you don't see [everyday](http://ust.chatango.com/um/d/a/datmamba/img/l_1084.jpg)`\Not nerves, yes tired. Klay is consistently short at better than 10'. `\Came down wrong and his knee buckled. Walked it off like a champ`\Wasn't just Kawhi, Green was being pesky as fuck. `\now that time of the year where we realize how hard its going to be to set a season wins record`\Spurs complained when they lost by 30 because Duncan wasn't playing. Yeah atta way to be fair bud.`\On* stupid mobile not letting me edit. `\So is this gonna be the Warriors' 95-96 Raptors game`\Steph + Klay are a combined 1-18 from three.`\imagine if durant didnt throw the ball away at the end of the GSW-OKC game. Could literally be the difference between GSW getting the record and coming up short`\Flair up or shutup. `\sounds like your tv is broken`\andy showing his dance moves lol`\Salty fucking broadcasters. You were wrong.`\The lack of foul calls for Kawhi there was ludacris`\So you do need at least one big guy to beat the Spurs`\Andrew BoGOAT`\**WWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWLWWWWWLWWWWWWWLWLWWWWWWWWWWWLWWWWWWWLWWWWWWWLWWWWW**ARRIORS!`\Lakers are playing with energy`\**SEASON STARTS NOW**`\Just turned the game on... what the hell happened?

I'd stay entertained enough`\Curry 6 for 17 . We are playing shit but by most standards that's not terrible and that's why we are still in the game.`\It's the city's main export.`\add the fact that there was no Iggy or Bogut`\Duncan came off the bench and played only 8 minutes tonight. We beat your asses fair and square.`\Whoever wins deserves to be champ.  These guys are in fantastic shape, and there aren't any back-to-backs in the playoffs.  There are even usually a couple extra days between the conference finals and the finals too, if memory serves.`\He's not talking about you idiot. He's talking about the lakers in general. I bet the lakers had as much bandwagon fans when shaq and Kobe were kicking ass as much as the Warriors do today `\They also had 11 turnovers in the first half. If they took care of the ball it was gonna be a blow out.`\Wasn't it a win-win from the start?`\I can't believe it's the refs keeping the Warriors, not the Lakers, in the game. What a crazy day.`\nice move`\"We're playing well."`\ballgame`\KLAY REACH (and touches the ball) JORDAN TEACHES `\it was aight`\Haven't felt this much hype in a while`\Don't worry their announcers are still telling all the Mavs fans "we're not getting any calls." What idiots. `\DAMN LAMARCUS`\Can we keep that three since you called off our first legit one earlier?`\Wake up, Dolan. You're dreaming. `\fouls on high screens are basically never called. `\This was a great game. Still waiting on the jack of all trades Draymond Green to show us why he is regarded as the best defensive player in the game. He can guard anyone.`\The pizza pocket eats me`\The D'Angelo/Julius Randle combo is going to look good in the years to come. Just need that head coach.`\winning the three point-competition must have taken a lot out of him `\I have this theory that since our young core aren't even 21 yet so maybe they're the only ones that aren't hung over? Lol `\The refs are playing down to the Warriors level.`\its just it was so obviously wrong`\spurs playing some of the best defense i have seen all year`\Hey, hey, Doug is a four time all-star too. He was a part of the 1972 US Men's team that got refballed to a loss against the Soviets`\And the endoplasmic reticulum.`\This game has been interesting `\I'll legit be shocked if the game tomorrow is even a game going into the 4th qrt.`\Tomorrow is going to be crazy...`\Get out the brooms because LA is gonna sweep the Warriors under the rug`\That is basically klay in a nutshell`\Draymond with 15 points, 16 rebounds, and 9 assists.

I'm actually legitimately curious how much he will sign for... Considering his humility and attitude about the "team."`\Kerr bout to give a stern talking to the team later.`\Brazilian jiu jitsu black belt Huertas choked Curry out. `\Yep, he's been a key part of our offense as a pick and roll man`\So this is what Golden State looks when they're pedestrian`\great game, Wolves commentators are fantastic to listen to`\They did a Curry lowlights on TV lol...`\Cut the act Kerr.`\J J Barea hates the warriors lol`\Yeah I thought you meant Huertas, I wasn't sure if you meant someone else tho.`\"Curry calls" comments incoming `\Dray is trash.

Plz.`\it takes a lot to make a stew`\Good god these refs aren't even being subtle about who they want to win`\Who puts a trash team like the Warriors on national TV?`\Dubs are on another level with their movement. Spurs look like their stuck in cement.`\Eight turnovers already for us

EIGHT`\Mac in to calm the team down with his scoring`\Holy flopping`\AUSTIN.... AUSTIN...... AUSTIN!!!!! `\The refs have lost control`\8 minutes total. So you'd be correct.`\exactly, becuase I think they are close to the bonus, if not now after the foul just now.

it's like come on kerr, they gave you a break! `\People seriously thought this was a good game? O.o`\Or Leonard `\I mean given the loss of players on the warriors and the shots they kept missing tonight the spurs should have stomped but the warriors showed just how well they can play defense when it's necessary. The game was 2-3 steph/klay shots from a win.`\Hibbert is in, he gave up an and-one.

Yep. The lead's gone, loved it while it lasted.`\Thunder game 2? They were outplayed until the 4th quarter`\I believe anything you say, /u/TimDuncanTheAlmighty.`\Same thing as when KC beat Green Bay when they were 14-0 and KC was winless. It makes it a fun fact, not a classic.`\Call me a homer, but the game gs played in okc looled pretty similar to this one in how Curry was harassed. Seemed to have the same playoff intensity. Curry just made amazing shots against us and missed against the Spurs. No hard feelings. As a basketball, Curry shows are fun to watch, just wish they weren't against okc. Haha `\Yeah the Warriors just have to have their worst shooting night of the year and turn it over 20 times again while the Blazers just have to go 56% from 3 abs 53% from the field. Clearly a repeatable recipe lol.`\    golden state brickers`\Mo Speights for the defensive substitution? What kind of world is this?`\Do a lowlight for Byron by showing lakers making good plays and Byron not tanking right `\It's what we need! Getting out of the first with a lead against this team would be huge considering how good our second quarters usually are`\The refs are hilarious. Literally every touch of a Warriors player has been a foul for the last like 3 minutes. Has there been an offensive possession for them without a foul? `\shaun surprisingly off`\McAdoo isn't really working out. `\Spurs. Deeper right now for crunch time and LMA is getting boards!`\*shhh you're a Thunder fan accept the compliment dammit!*`\Loved seeing Speights drill jumpers in Perkins face. Google Speights and Perkins and you'll see they don't like each other `\.......`\Feels so wrong, but seems so right.`\Can you imagine if Byron was brought in to lead the tank brigade and then after this they turn it around despite him and somehow make the playoffs? Like at that point is Byron so bad he can't even tank a team or is he so good he can't even tank a team? And what do you even do next season with him?....
**SO MANY QUESTIONS**`\Neither, he is just a bit off, he will get hot at some point.`\Nice defense there.`\Guys, I have to visit my granparents. Fuuuuuuck :( ima miss the game `\David Lee's stat sheets always look good, but his +/-, no so much.`\Not if they want good tacos they're not`\What's that in your eye?`\Awww, my wet dream...`\Kobe like, are you not entertained? `\hahaha

The Raptors beat the 72-10 Bulls too!`\Warriors are playing like trash right now. This is hard to watch.`\Ironman Matthews Noooooo :'(`\please no`\The Spurs disrespect game: Kerr plays McAdoo, Clark, Looney, the ghost of Vladimir Radmanovic, and a hobo from a moon tower`\They scored 120pts on the Warriors at Oracle without Dirk. `\Well that makes sense thanks`\Every game the Warriors play, they break new records. They seem impossible to beat. Don't know if anyone can beat them in a 7-game series in the playoffs. It's incredible they only have 6 losses still.`\Has it been that long?  I should go outside`\WHY. Barbosa is money`\Aldridge was amazing on both ends tonight, especially on the switches. `\They did the other meeting too, though.`\It's not being on top, Spurs dont get hate. It's your fan base. It's complete garbage.`\they would have had one if sam mitchell didnt use it to tell him to miss it`\I love them both. No ragrets.`\Because he was almost unanimously considered the better prospect at the time?`\lol that last GSW play reflects the lakers season but the score doesnt`\Klay and Curry combined 1-15 from 3. what the shit

edit: the rest of the team is actually 2-7 which is also weird lol`\The Lakers focused all of their energy on this game. No wonder they've been losing so many others. Game planning for the Warriors. They can't play anything like this tomorrow or they ain't breaking any record.`\Nope. Against Dallas. `\Not that time Steph`\Diaw is what every fat old guy at my local YMCA thinks they are`\That's... a bad call. Leonard should be allowed to post up there like that`\Dude that is the FIFTH shot of D-Will's that has hit the side of the backboard, what the fuck`\Diaw, you big french bastard, you move like a snail and probably eat them too (I've had escargot and it's fucking delicious), but goddammit I love you so much`\You could copy paste this comment into nearly every close GSW game. `\He's not a good shooter though off the block. They try when he has a small guy on him `\What is even happening with GS? `\Lakers hungover right now`\Yeah, although LAL have been trapping them well and keeping pressure on steph throughout the court instead of near the 3 line.  Warriors were playing sloppy as well with their T/Os and the Lakers really capitalized on em - especially in the 1st half.  Great play by D
lo, Clarkson and surprisingly Young made a few great shots in the second half.`\Wtf happened? Warriors had 3 days of rest too.`\Not just that. The Warriors are 3-29 from 3 and Steph and Klay are a combined 1-18. It's opposite day or some shit`\As the owner of the Cavs 2016 1st rounder pick, that is kind of nice. `\these fluke shots by the Warriors. It is just so hard for a team to keep pace.`\Nah GS @ OKC was`\Damn that was ugly    `\Salty`\If lakers were a decent team, 11-1 turnovers they would be 15-20+up on the gsw. Too bad we know the dubs will win in the 2nd half. `\Looks like it, worst game they've played this season`\MARCELO HUERTAS IS THE CURRY STOPPER`\just play the starters the entire fucking fourth quarter at this point.. who fucking cares.. I'm sick of being subjected to watching a national disaster when the bench comes in `\What happened to parsons?`\How the fuck does that thing still get upvotes?`\The Lakers had always had a dominant big man in order to be successful

Only reason they didn't pick Okafor was that they already had Randle. Having 2 all offense, no defense big men was just too much to stomach`\Get Larry Nance in this damn game, Byron.`\got caught underneath the treads`\Mavs going cold...here we go Dubs`\Who else is expecting Barnes to miss every single shot now?`\Let's fucking gooooo!!!`\Thompson got the matchup with Mills, the Spurs adjusted with Parker, and now the San Antonio Spurs  have been better defensively since the last substitution. It's also meant better offense too. `\Pop taking away handicap by keeping Timmy out. Such a class act`\This is what I get for snickering when my friend mentioned the Lakers were playing the Warriors today.`\That Draymond three was just silliness.`\Or the Sixers!`\Lol`\A bunch of TOs, 10% 3 point shooting`\Awesome, it's old people dancing!

That's why I got League Pass, rather watch old people dancing than stupid commercials.`\It always reminds me of 2010 Giants. It is unofficially the anthem to that team.`\Relax man, we're still a game ahead of the Bulls, and we're finding ways to win games with injuries/not playing our best. We may or may not get the record, but we'll be damn close. And it's all about the shampionship.`\Hell yeah. Fuck the Lakers and their Swag Bros.`\millsap wide open 3 at the end of regulation should have been the dagger, huge lost opportunity for ATL`\Jack approves`\Well that gif isn't from tonight so there's your answer. `\Spurs already tired

/s`\Mo'Buckets looks likes hes trying to take some of Barnes's money`\Aldridge is feasting, Warriors are really missing their bigs`\we live and die by the three. `\too bad we cant ride the starters forever, i think smitch might tho lol`\REBOUND THE DAMN BALL`\Manu needs to stop making risky passes that fucking asshole. `\Fuck you! I want the win!`\Can I order a 71-11 shirt right now?`\The fixed the bug before the game ended according to the Twitter

`\That's the reason it starts. The advantage the whiners get is too unfair for the rest of the players not to.`\It's the Kobe socks`\Is this happening? This is happening. `\I see bandwagon all over those faces `\I don't dislike JVG but he's not quite clever enough to justify his snark.`\IM SO EXCITED FOR THIS PLAYOFF SERIES`\Smitch.`\Mo Speights is the greatest Warrior of all time.`\You realize racist /pol/ users are the only reason it got popular in the first place right? There's a reason /r/The_Donald is full of the word.`\Lololololol

Curry has no chill`\kawahi is getting raped by the refs tonight. i feel sorry for the guy.`\Thank you for making me laugh`\Thats... What he just said`\Warriors be [like](http://imgur.com/gallery/EEyFLwE/new)`\Absolutely. I already went through all this. I watched the FO squander the talent they had through the KG years cycling junk in and out of the team. I already watched Kahn and Taylor turn this team into the laughing stock of the NBA.

If the FO can't figure out they need a real fucking coach (just like they needed a real fucking GM) and not someone's buddy who once saw a basketball game back in 1991 and knows what a screen is then I am absolutely done.

I'm not even close to the only one that feels this way either. Watch the games, the stands are fucking empty. We've got one of the most exciting young cores in the league and the stands have like 73 people in them. It's insane to me they can't see the issue. It's one thing to lose games because you don't have the talent and you're just trying to get a couple more pieces. It's another thing to lose so many games by 3 or 4 points in the last few minutes of a game because your coach can't draw up a play the defense doesn't see coming from miles away.

Rubio literally rolled his eyes on camera last night when Mitchell was telling him how to inbound the ball. Like it was as clear as could be, dude straight up rolled his eyes...and it happens all the time. `\Yeah, and this instance wasn't even sagging. He straight up turned his back on JJ and ran to the big to double.`\I thought that was Thunder Nation`\bruh`\;)`\Ha!`\Black Falcon sighting!`\Agreed!`\"The real is better than the game, when you play the video game, people get frustrated because they can't do the shot Curry does in the real game" - Jim Petersen	`\LMA is dad dicking Dray down low all night. `\what the hell was that lineup from the wolves? the 'please andrew do something' lineup?`\Welcome to r/nba`\I think we have a pretty good excuse as to why we might lose tbh.

Back to back, missing a couple key players.

We should still win this game and I'm not happy with those excuses. But they are reasons we may lose this game `\can't call em the dubs tonight `\Spurs played almost perfectly tonight. Warriors deserve a lot of credit for keeping it close right up through the end.

I think we have to keep in mind that Warriors were on second night of a back to back, missing both of their 7' rim defenders, and missing their 6th man and play maker Andre Iguodala.

Not saying the Spurs didn't earn this win, they definitely did, but I don't think small ball got exposed. Small ball is meant to be played limited minutes, not most of a game.`\Don't feel bad, fans get to do that, we don't make the decisions or sign the checks, what we get to do is bitch on the internet and to the people at work.`\It was a Harry Potter weekend too. `\Would probably be the most crazy thing in history `\Ugly turnover. God I hate our bench.`\saLty`\Man, this thread was nicer when it was just wolves and warriors fans.`\Never again`\It really hurts when the 3's aren't dropping. Plenty of open 3's for the Warriors missed.`\Still not sure how Booker reminds anybody of Klay. The way they move and shoot is not similar at all. They just have similar size and skin tone and can shoot.`\I fudged out typing it. I deserve that `\Spurs need to stop turning the ball over. Warriors need to stop allowing so many offensive rebounds. Refs need to figure out what the fuck is going on. So many strange calls going both ways.`\i remember them being the "up and coming" team 2 years ago. i may be wrong though.`\It's about how much the teams hate each other. See Bears Packers`\Knight hitting those 3's was kinda unavoidable, but yes, they are guilty of taking opponents lightly.  Those damn millennials man, I swear...`\Huertas is playing well. `\Fitz is getting more and more annoying, but JB is fine.`\11-6 MIN`\SO many fouls on Curry in one play `\When he's not hitting threes, he's usually dishing assists, arcing layups, and, most importantly, drawing the defense.`\I mean i get your point but I don't see GSW shooting like that very often. This was the exception not the rule `\I'm saying the refs have been calling fouls on us on defense the entire game. Where did I say the refs should stop calling our fouls lmao.`\It's not about the team, it's about their level of play.  Don't knock on them unless you actually watched the game.  Curry is fine.  `\Teams compete all of the time with missing players. Spurs almost beat the Heat in 2013 with way more players missing.`\Totally agree. But this was still less of a contrast than a shootout with Curry scoring 40 would have been.

Also, the thing that kills me (even though I do like college) is that they don't even go for 2 for 1s at the end of the half cus coaches have so little trust in their offenses.`\Ehhh it definitely took longer than 45 seconds but yeah crazy either way`\Draymond with low energy today`\Win so we get your pick

GO Lakers`\Nick Young is easily one of the most annoying players in the league`\lol`\Lakers 2016 Champs road to 31-51`\You're just that guy I don't know.`\not a classic? if you dont think one of the worst teams in the league blowing out a historically great team isnt a classic, then i dont know what is.`\Lmao Kerr is fired up`\How dare you miss Gonzaga vs Utah for this!  Just kidding.`\i didnt hear that, i dont know why they would though. absolutely text book block`\John Cena Spanish Reality Game Show Called American Grit? I might watch.`\Bigs? You mean LMA, right? `\Can't score on Drey either. Only 2 baskets when Drey had him straight up.`\Good point. I guess against the better teams we grind it out and our wins are more defense oriented (like the Clippers win last week), but we definitely do blow out what seems like half the league. `\D'LO!!!`\Clarkson is the main reason the Lakers in this`\This is what I came here to see Swaggy P`\Lol why is Duncan sweating his balls off`\Long story short, Levante beat Barcelona`\That made me happy`\What happened? I heard he was having surgery or something`\58% from 3-pt range just absolutely filthy`\GS is a hell of a defensive team, too. `\jesus the warriors are trash`\Fuck em`\There still isn't room for another big man who doesn't shoot. Especially on a bench that usually has Smart and Turner. Sully and even Zeller are better floor spacers. And Amir is really just paid to dunk and play d. Lee was just always a bad fit here. He was also bad, for sure.`\Indeed. Live and learn man.`\CLARKSON NICE`\Huh?`\[WE BACK IN THE BUILDIN'](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=By5t5VQ7zOQ)`\If we're actually keeping score it's Curry- 3 Huertas -1 `\Hmm. `\The funny thing with HB is I now assume he's going to miss the shot if he's wide open. smh`\Every time I see Shabazz handle the ball he thinks he's fucking LeBron James.`\GOTY candidate?`\I can't help but think that the dubs are playing right into the Spurs hands that the score after 3Q is so low.

Those last 3 minutes you guys completely shut Curry down.

Okay.`\Yup`\Refs philosophy: call a foul when there is no foul, when there is no foul, call a foul`\Considering the Warriors average 9 more possessions than the last team. It's not that big of a deal if you take possessions and pace into account for a team that is as efficient as GS.

We are in the middle of the pack for turnovers on any given night. Within 1 turnover there is a difference of being 13th or 20th.  Most NBA teams fall within 13.5-15.5 turnovers per game.

`\The Vegas odds for Portland winning by 22+ that night were 750 to 1 so there's that.

Players need to stop that hop step at full speed shit. Chances are pretty good that it's not gonna end well. You need to slow up first and then do the hop step.

That was SO blatant, how the fuck was that not called?`\Vine player makes me wanna kill myself.`\At any number it was a shitty bet. As crazy as it is, 25k is probably about right...

That's the new high watermark in my experience`\Yeah, *the God of hell*.

*dun dun dunnn...*`\FREE TARIK BLACK`\Everyone, prepare to overreact to every play, every poor decision by the ref, the final score and an ocean's worth of salt.

`\If losing to the Lakers let us sweep the Clippers, it was worth it.`\I would never not have an erection.`\Oh, my bad. I was wearing a towel so I didn't see it.`\But the defender ran straight into him... I don't really think it mattered at that point.`\Let's Go Lakers!!! Clap clap clapclapclap!!!`\That's a travel`\yeet!`\One thing that I've noticed is that, maybe due to his small stature, he tends to get non-calls even while being *very* physical. Curry uses his arms and body to keep the offensive player in front of him but tends not to get called for much. It's not often very egregious, but I found his play against Wall sometimes could have been called blocking fouls or some other contact foul. He also fronts big men often enough on the pick-and-roll switches and it's effective; I think part of that effectiveness is the refs being biased towards small players and letting them play physical. Unrelated to this physicality and non-calls, he also has very active hands that causes quite a bit of disruption.`\clearly a fucking foul`\tv`\But that actually was a foul?`\5-12... I hope not... but my nightmare scenario is that, lol.`\Garbage 3 attempt by Curry`\>If they lose it's because they played poorly.

And if they play poorly, it's because they've been thrown out of their comfort zone by an all-time great defense.`\Lakers fans must be regretting buying Warriors jerseys prematurely.`\Clarkson on fire`\Huertas man, must've gotten tired of being on Shaqtin a Fool`\That is an unnecessarily large graphic `\AT&T Center is fucking rocking.`\They have absolutely canned so many decisions for both teams`\pls stop making danny green putting it on the floor`\...who also threw the Warriors off their game by dictating pace, harassing them on defense, and controlling the boards.

>Me: ... we're talking about Russell again, guys. Again. Seriously, its the same person every time.

>Mom: No thats vlade!`\make curry watch. yes. then he's gonna come off the bench like rick grimes after watching that dude try to fuck carl. (i hope?)`\Damn Kerr is mad af!`\Really, it's unbelievable that people are supporting what is shaping up to be one of the best NBA teams of all time?`\8 turnovers in the first quarter(although, that turnover at the end of the first from tim duncan's inbound didn't really matter) still..`\Mjax is getting so hard at post play against the warriors.`\Speights should play defense like this everynight.`\They puttin' Barnes on you Bob0. Eat that motherfucker up!`\I called it bruh`\Man Wiggins really screwed up these last few minutes. Missed a bunch of rotations, and took that shit shot on that last possession. `\deangelo "damian "stephen curry" lillard " russel`\Nope not real `\Thanks magic! ;) `\so there is a god`\Defense wins championships Erneh.`\Err we smashed the Cavs with Love/Irving last time we played.`\Wos Angelllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllles Wakers`\Holy fuck that's the most heated I've seen Kerr `\Nah, if it's a game vs the GSW you can guarantee the refs are going to be out in full force for them. It never fails. `\Pls give them to us less fortunate`\me too`\GOD DAMNIT`\You play the same defense on Curry and you get 40, props to Tony Parker just for completing his assignment- Charles 'the round mound of jerks' Barkley`\That was an excellent game in spite of some shitty officiating at times.

The intensity and defense was playoff-like

Not only do we get to see these teams face off two more times in the regular season. Hopefully we also get to see them in the playoffs. They did a great job of harassing Steph tonight. And the warriors overall shot like shit from 3

I'm not gonna go so far as to say that this is the blueprint to beat them, I still don't think they are beatable. If this was the best punch from the Spurs, they only lost by 8. They still play great defense, and come playoff time if healthy, no team is gonna stop steph, klay, and draymond for 4 straight games`\No they didn't `\Splash brothers playing like the Trash Brothers today.`\Kerr is fucking embarrassed right now`\Tim Duncan coming off the bench for the third time in his career.`\March Madness is fun and all, but I'm ready for real basketball`\I reckon Spurs are a little bit lucky tonight with those very difficult shots who are going in and some Warriors players are out or not in the game.`\Been a warriors fan for as long as Ive watched basketball, he just looks tired after last nights game. He usually crosses over big men and he hasn't really been able to. `\Is it just me or does Marc Jackson seem to copy what JVG says...a lot?`\Switch everything even if it's a big?`\I saw this on /all. I'm by no means a guy that follows the NBA. I had never heard of the "Golden State Warriors." So I looked them up, expecting them to be a new franchise or a recently relocated team. Nope, always been the Warriors, since 1946 and they've been "Golden State" since 1971. I thought I was generally aware of what teams existed, but TIL there's a super old team that's won four championships and I'm officially mind-fucked.

Anyway, I'll leave y'all to talk basketball.`\Were not the Larriors anymore!

^^kill ^^me`\Steve Nash`\What in the world happened?`\Mavs came out playing fast. Pretty sure it was a conscious effort on their part. `\THEY NEED 2 THREES TO TIE IT. LET EM TAKE THE FREE THREES. DON'T FOUL. MOTHER OF GOD DON'T FUCKING FOUL THE THREES. PLAY IT SMART. RUN IT OUT.`\LaMarcus reactivating his twitter tonight

*I'm back bitches!*`\Defense requires more energy and Warriros have shown that there shooting is a constant. One game considering how many back to backs they have had in a short stretch doesn't reflect how good they shoot the ball. `\Cam they guard power forwards?`\��������`\Yea, I thought they were but I wasnt 100% confident on that. `\Clarkson: 3-3 from 3. GSW: 3-18. Clarkson confirmed better than the Warriors`\Great defensive plan from byron this game.`\That's what she said `\You literally don't. They open the beers when you buy em, and then hand them to you. Drank a bunch at the game on Thursday `\haha... WarrioRefs.`\wtf is green complaining about`\That's not Corey Spaghetti his arms are too small `\Damn I probably just watched that ~45 times`\I still remember when he was doing [this.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EebuaDemic8) He's come so far.`\Basketball still surprises you every now and then. `\Haha yall are out after the first or second round. There will be no wcf`\Miami up 75-51 on Cleveland`\Danny falls ON TOP of Curry, No foul...`\Rebounds are a foreign concept to GS tonight.`\pls no comeback. i'll cry`\On the other hand I was amazed about Alex Len's performance. he just kept hitting those shots!`\Dubs are cold...playing down to their comp as usual`\LOL Jack :D`\Barnes about to get Cooked alive `\The olde "Hot Start Against The Champs" routine, eh Mavs?`\Why do you care so much how long people were fans? `\That's how you play DEFENSE`\3 ball ain't so exciting when they don't go in huh`\Must...refrain...referee...criticism...`\seems like both spurs and dubs tired each other out on sat`\He's a mental midget compared to Rodman`\Pls no acl`\Jesus christ SA DJ, enough Pitbull!`\Eh. Get used to that. They said that both games we beat GS in playoffs last year. `\We'll give him back to you for Dray.`\I mean it's not for lack of trying. Deandre and dirk would have formed an ideal front court with rebounding,  scoring, defense, and spacing. They've spent a ton of money and assets on the perimeter in the last 15 months between rondo, Wes Mathews, parsons, etc`\So basically, the only time the Warriors lose is if Curry and Klay have bad games. That makes every team hopeful in beating them lol Dubs haven't even lost two games in a row, I don't think that will change in the playoffs.`\http://imgur.com/6f9mRYt.jpg`\I've been seeing a few salty Raptors fans too. Not sure why though. `\Mostly against bad teams on the road. `\He's the Brandon belt of the Warriors`\Its happened against other teams(not spurs, cavs or thunder) but usually other guys step up. The team has enough weapons to stay in games. `\He's looking good out there.`\Falling from the ceiling`\WHAT THE FUCK HAPPENED?????????`\/u/era650 deleted his account

I mean... 25k to win 100? Wut?`\# Where was you when Warriors was kill. I was in arena and see the score. "Warriors is kill". "Yes".

Real Talk - I was only at the game because it was my (and Shaq's) Birthday, and I'm so hyped but crying inside for the Tank.`\>We lost this one ourselves

No, you lost to a team that played good D. It's not all about your 3pt %.`\Super small lineup with rush`\Diaw is eating his cheerios! Hope they keep feeding him. `\im always saying drive first, then midrange, then work the three when they're cold.

instead they just keep trying, hoping for the law of large numbers`\straight up luck`\We are one PF away from being special.

And a coach. `\Because we aren't playing to our full capacity either`\is ABC fucked up for everyone or is it just me?`\Referees doing work like usual. Curry hooked Kwahi's arm... and got Kwahi a foul call for it? haha. `\It's pretty hard to score 87 points and blow out a team like the Warriors.

Holy shit. `\They're just hating on the Warriors because they have skills.`\Guaranteed hectic start here`\No`\I'm dying watching this. A playoff series between us will kill me, no doubt.`\Great analysis by TWolves crew on the previous out of bounds play. `\If you think it's possible cool because I don't. Even if it was, I think the Warriors as they proved tonight, can compete with Steph playing subpar especially when Iggy and bogut are in the mix.`\Damn Dray with that sick steal then that sick 3`\Would you like me to relieve it for you
`\Heat up 30 dayum`\idk how they keep doing this lol, warriors have the basketball gods watching over them`\I certainly hope so. Why drop that kind of money and have your front office mismanage the franchise with nepotism and favorites.`\I still can't get over what has happened to the Lakers, Jesus `\mcadoo is a boss`\Holy shit`\you can't be serious lol`\"AND THEIR ONLY DOWN 5" guess they can stop saying that 20 times in a fucking row`\I don't think there are any`\You guys have better rested starters`\As long as we don't have to face the Lakers`\My boy. Hope he becomes an All-Star for y'all`\Your dad excited for the Giants season to kick off?!`\bricks for days`\Evan Turner? I don't see any similarities at all. Why did you think that?`\Fun fact: someone once asked David Stern what his Deen NBA  Finals matchup would be. He replied "The Lakers vs the Lakers"`\Oh shit curry mad`\let's get a 5 guard rotation, why the hell not`\Curry our best rebounder`\Yes Green! `\YESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS`\This was one of the greatest regular season games I have ever seen.`\Yeah, tbh I think that game said more about how good the Warriors are than how good you guys are. Down both centers and their best bench player, second night of a fairly competitive back to back, on the road, Steph and Klay are both completely off and they still almost won.

Now, obviously the Spurs deserve credit for harassing Steph and Klay all night and credit for winning with very little from Duncan. I just think that game made me feel more convinced that the Warriors are a not insignificant amount better than the Spurs, despite the loss.`\If we go out and basketball more than they basketball we're in with a good shot of winning.`\That or the fact that reddit is bugged right now and only half the posts and comments are showing up.`\I get it now. But my intent wasn't the same. I was legitimately impressed by the kid. `\Spurs new defensive coordinator: Fat Jimmy. `\LARRY`\Nitro boost `\So this is winning basketball.`\fuck yeah Mo!`\I think you're right. Their first meeting in November 2014. `\Danny is so fucking awesome. Can't score? No problem. He'll defend hard.`\Refs like Kawhi less than Steph.

That said, neither player really gets calls. `\Maybe Pop sees the Duncan is at a disadvantage in this game.`\Then April 10th @ Spurs again, honestly don't want either team to win at their home games. At this point of the season I just want to see a WC Finals between the two. Any other games or teams are irrelevant.`\GG. `\I like the Clippers, hope y'all get Blake back in time for playoffs(:`\Someone please add a 3 pointer going into a basket behind him.`\Is steph past his prime? ;)`\Dacos? against GSW? It might happen.`\I wonder how many fans in the arena started of supporting the Warriors and ended the game supporting the Lakers lol`\Not when both of our @Spurs games are the second game of a back to back. No thanks. `\KAT leaping all over the place.`\Two potential undefeated at home 72 win teams.. in a single season? Godd dayumm `\NIIICE, I'd love to play Destiny but I don't wanna play a game on a network. I vastly prefer standalone games.

Just employ Byron Scott as your coach, and sign your biggest star to maximum deal that kills your cap room. `\He already landed`\damn that looked bad`\We better score here`\Clearly a foul a well. Flop doesn't negate the foul`\Lol we are the best team in the league. We match up fine with Utah `\STICKUM HOWARD`\It's funny, when dubs fans are crying about the refs, I usually downvote them. So maybe it's not just warriors fans who are putting that salt in the negative. `\I'm glad this sub can have such a positive outlook on bandwagon fans.

Coincidence?`\Is there something in the casebook saying if Curry is near a play, the foul is on the other player?`\hahahahahahaha`\Do you guys think that Klay yells "Curry!" when he shoots it from that far out?`\Got that high res reaction gif. Respect.`\Goodrich/West?`\Or run plays....`\Clarkson has been pure today`\double dribble but damn Clarkson just fool ref`\The Big Croissant!`\r u a wizard?`\I never noticed before the State Farm commercial but DeAndre has some nice legs...`\Why the fuck is Kawhi iced out of our own fuckin offense? Where's his post ups?`\What is it with spurs always committing turnovers when playing us??`\The 2014 WCF in hockey was exactly that. OT to determine game 7. It didn't matter who was playing the Kings or Hawks from the east, they weren't winning. `\True but that was in the playoffs. Everyone for some reason only counts the regular season.`\It was killing me to watch him in the post against Watson and Jennings and always looking to pass. `\Found this on the floor: \\`\Daddy has come off the bench`\Great play green`\unbelievable. literally unbelievable. like how could you not see that livingston's ass hit curry?


`\Warriors have no defense without iggy and bogut `\I love you`\Please don't give our management any ideas`\what's a yam to a nonbelieverrrrrrr`\Head coach trumps defensive coordinator. Ty Lue very obviously changed our pacing, which gives us less energy to play defense. It doesn't matter if his scheme stays the same because our players are too tired to run it. The slow-ass tempo we used last season gave us a better defensive effort, which is what San Antonio did to beat them tonight. I don't even see how you can argue this, the stats very clearly say that our defense got much worse. How can you explain that?`\His injury really affected his play `\Rings will be confiscated from the Frauden State wArriors and given to Kobe Bryant.`\Can't tell if ABC is doing the audio slightly ahead of the video thing again. `\Probably gave him the shits as well`\guess i jinxed it`\im gonna stand by my statement. probably give or take 1 point`\You just knew it.`\Why are Melissa McCarthy movies always exactly the same?`\come on man, how aren't we putting away this game? It's at home, it's a back to back for them, they're missing basically 2 starters, and they're shooting piss-poor. `\I bet you like Fitz`\Called the Jazz taking them to the edge to a friend at work today`\That's BS. We start 2 bigs who aren't 3 point shooters. We put the ball in his hands a lot in the beginning of the season and he was a comedy of errors. He just didn't bother to get into shape until we cut him. `\Did someone tell Steph before the game, "hey, I don't think you do enough behind the back passes"? `\You know what, I ain't even mad.`\�� that man has a family `\[Boban laughs at your definition of massive.](http://imgur.com/gallery/T2NCIjk)`\Are you sure?

For any contender that's a loss.`\Klay's 8/27 night and horrible officiating, we got bailed out by terrific Dubs defense and Hawks missing so many open shots`\Theyd be fine if they didnt turn the ball over as much`\>Dad: they are cathching up!!

You have to actively try to "kick" the ball for the call. `\haha curry on that rubio shot`\I like you`\too many missed 3's, that is the tl, dr of the game.`\You better hope that you aren't playing Portland in the 1st round, that's a 50/50 series at best.`\Dubs aren't gonna keep missing 3s. Spurs need to execute much better and stop turning it over. `\You can tell this is Manu's last year, he wants to go out with heart.

His overall numbers are about what they have been(slightly down because of the cold streak). His role on the team has never been huge. He is asked to play defense, rebound, and hit the corner three(the occasional iso). Not to mention that he is 23.`\Refs were bad both ways though.

Hopefully the suns come back strong next year because in my opinion they have the potentially coolest rookie of the last 5 years`\What are you talking about? that's like his 3rd one.`\Good energy so far, Sunday national TV and Warriors will do that. `\HAHAHAHA SHOW HIM HOW ITS DONE NICK`\lol Metta World Peace with the only negative +/- for the Lakers`\This game is giving me chills.`\For tying up the ball? Lol`\8 point leads gone in 30 seconds`\first call for curry getting mauled`\-Steve Kerr`\DLee really wants that W`\Monster rebound by kawhi`\what the fuck, you mean the one where Rubio held down Greens arm when he jumped?`\Our organization is classy.  We are assholes.  But your team sucks.`\Well that's why used the "effect" rather than "theory" it's too short of a time for the Ewing theory to be fully established in this situation. But for one game you could say making LMA step up with the lack of Duncan produced an "effect" on LMA similar to the Ewing theory.

I should get a Law degree, then all I'll need is the DUI to be a full fledged lawyer.`\Yeah. Towards the end they put up a stat comparing the two warriros bench was close to 40 and wolves didn;t even break 10. If you're bench doubled you win and 20 out of that should not be a big ask.

Your big 3 are great and in about 5 years I can easily see the warriros hating to play them. You guys match up extremely well already. `\So I'm watching the pregame where 2K Sports is talking about having to write new algorithms changing the physics of the game in order to best stimulate the season Steph Curry's having, i.e. 60% from >30 feet, having a 98 rating and possibly having >100 rating in the future.

The fun in seeing such an impossible, imitable iconoclast of a player is giving him a nickname:

Michael "Air" Jordan

Earvin "Magic" Johnson

And now,

Steph "Human Cheat Code" Curry`\Serious question.. How much would ya have to pay for average-ish seats for this game? Would be ridiculous `\Bless your heart. Have some gold.`\Let's go`\The fact that you think that's a bigger problem than it actually is says a whole lot.`\LOL david west.`\LETS START THE PARTY RIGHT NOW. Lol so much cringe`\Please let these teams make it to the WCF!`\Can anyone on this team make both free throws tonight?? They're freebies!!`\Curry def needs some time off`\Why are you talking trash about your own team :p`\LOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOL`\Will hate to try and count how many times Skip will call them his Spurs, on the next First Take`\They look more energized than last game.`\what a pass by draymond`\Clarkson learned so much from Nash, he, too, juggles the ball with hia feet.`\NANCE A MAKEM DANCE`\How much did the Mark Cuban pay the refs?`\No he doesn't.`\Most of their 3s weren't opened. Hmmmm they missed a lot of 3s vs the best team at defending 3s.

Excuses, excuses, excuses `\This gif would be about a million times better if you could actually see what preceded the arc of the ball...`\Was it a good deal?`\LMAO CURRY`\WE COVERED THE SPREAD!!!`\If he's even still in the league next year.`\The top 6-7+ comments are all jokes or Lakers > Warriors. Not sure that post from yesterday got through aha`\I give him the Green light to start breaking shit`\If these two teams meet in the WCF the series is going to be a fucking blood bath and I can't wait.`\Our bench hasn't been too great tonight`\varajao seems like a great off-court teammate. he honestly seems like such a nice, positive dude.`\OH MY GOD I JUST CAME`\Time for the bench to be clutch AF`\Live by the three, die by the three. The Warriors rely on it way too much. Plus 20 turnovers doesn't help. `\Fml`\It doesn't take much to play you like a fiddle though^1

^1: ^112>95`\you don't like green tea??`\One of my favorite things about watching the Dubs is how unorthodox their lineups are sometimes.`\God if the playoff series is like this I will not be watching, this is painful

edit: I guess gruelling, foul heavy games with loads of open missed shots and loads of turnovers are fun`\I mean, they're the defending champs and they're probably going to break the record for wins in a season. You should have been scared long before tonight.`\I think OKC are the best rebounding team in the league though, so it's not that strange.`\That stickum`\The Spurs were playing sloppy basketball and the Splash bros were cold. That will not happen again. The rematch will be different game but the Spurs still can win. `\no worries, i could've worded it better`\Is this the first year of nba prime time? I like a prime time game on Saturday `\Um. If you dont get it. Dubs have ALOT of valid ones.`\Good game you immaculate fucks `\Lol the warriors will dad dick the Mavs in the first round. They shot at about their average 3 pt % while Dallas had randoms hitting 3's all over the place that would never usually fall. Anomalies be damned a win is a win at this point in the season and nothing else matters`\sigh this team is just way too damn good`\Man would he have looked silly if it didn't go in`\How the fuck is this happening? In 10 years, what will you say when asked "where were you when the 2016 Tankers beat the 73 win Warriors?" `\Yeah, saw the graphic right after. Thanks.`\Hey guys, at least it wasn't another moving screen on Dray this time. `\I also think Carlisle is intentionally hiding schemes and rotations from the Warriors in hopes that maybe he can get an edge somehow in a 7 game series.

The last game the Mavs played against the Warriors was maybe the least amount of switching or rotating I've ever seen them execute on defense all season long.  `\Still one 76ers game left. `\S/o to the Warriors announcers being all doom and gloom midway through the third. "This is a classic kind of game for the Warriors.. Reminds us of the Denver game earlier this season" when the Warriors were down like FIVE.

SERIOUSLY, almost every Warriors fan is being spoiled by this seasons team. If the game is even close getting near the fourth, everyone is worried and calling the game a potential loss repeatedly.

On the other hand, that momentum swing at the beginning of the fourth quarter was classic 2016 Warriors basketball. The arena got loud and it looked like the score went from down ten to tied in like 17 seconds.

This is a team for the ages. `\When he got to the line in the 4th the crowd chanted 'WARRIORS'



 Missed a chance to give Mo some MVP love`\To think the Warriors picked Barnes over Drummond`\Holy shit the Spurs broke Steph Curry`\Not a really a Warriors fan, but why is it that when Curry does well against a good defensive team it's "it's only one game" or "it's just the regular season" but when he does poorly its "lol Curry is exposed"`\Just stopped what I was doing to log into Reddit and find this game thread and say HELL FUCKIN YEAH. `\The previous play Danny green literally fell on him for no foul`\Lol`\Good for David Lee. I fuckin love that dude. **FULL SQUAD**

But WTF Barbosa.`\Why isn't Curry shooting like Curry.. this makes me sad :(`\I bet the Sportscenter coverage shows Curry's 1 make over and over`\"Fouled"`\lol let's hear this`\We can't stop shit. There will be a 30+ point quarter at least once if not twice this game. `\100% agree. They tend to play like this in trap-games =(.`\Warriors fans get your hot take here: "I ain't mad it was the biggest upset in league history; I'm mad they seemed to be having fun during it"`\God dammit, just tuned in, why does Marc Jackson have to be doing this game?`\REKT`\Crazy that they need to finish 11-3 to beat the Bulls' record.`\So like the Maloofs and Ranadive`\big ol' women.`\And he wasnt even shooting open 3s. In the playoffs,  he can kill you with those.`\Yeah everyone's always forgetting that the games are supposed to be fun. `\And man Thursday is going to be a HELL OF A NIGHT you know the thunder are going to come out with fire but I think the wArriors will be ready but I'm a thunder and wArriors fan so I just hope for a good game `\For it was for dominating and being the face of basketball the past 20 years.`\Between you and me, I think the Clippers GM is having an affair with Austin's mother. It's how I got to play on my high school team.`\HOLD ON  LAKERS U CAN DO IT`\SOOOO many reach-ins by GS that aren't called, yet we get a whistle every time on the other end.`\Totally. Would be better if we had a starting quality center and our FMVP back. But Dray brought his hard hat as usual. Klay looking VERY active on D too. `\I always thought it was funny when players like Kendrick Perkins would throw the full court shot at the end of a quarter.  and like not even hit the back board and it'd go into the stands.  would suck if you were in the third row not paying attention and got drilled because that asshole was trying his best steph curry. `\*Kerr

also they only have Speights and McAdoo.. what else you gonna do`\Yeah I'll take things I thought I'd never read for 500 hundred`\Moral story of this game: Champions always find a way to win.`\this sub would have gone apeshit (again) if he wasn't called for that 'screen' on crawford in the 4th`\Portland was playing worse and look where they are. I still think we would have turned the season around with Knight and Bled healthy. At the very least to something a lot more respectable than 17-50`\Is this the filming of Space Jam 2 where the whole Warriors team got their talents stolen?`\Yeah I noticed when they showed the replay. Idk how that was missed.`\I am at the game and you are not far off my friend.   So many curry jerseys...  I don't remember seeing anything like this since MJ`\He can do whatever he wants, but if he fouls curry it's a foul whether he's in control of his body or not`\Probably the same thing as Davis Unibrow

`\Yeah :( fuckn Aldridge. `\Much better than last time`\Jazz what the hell guys you had it till the very end.`\I miss the spaghetti bot.`\If the team goes out in the second round once again this year, do you think that Ballmer would consider giving Doc the boot?`\randle just gave up on guarding steph lol`\Golden state can't buy a 3 and they're turning the ball over constantly `\this is so hard to watch as a warriors fan`\The warriors getting the attention is what the Spurs want. You guys fly under the radar and strike come playoff time. `\Really goes to show how amazing that shot is in the first place.`\I think you may be able to do it if you go through your phone's browser and switch to desktop view.

I don't think you can do it through the app, at least not Alien Blue, or through the mobile site. `\Can't wait 'till other teams figure this out and the Warriors lose the rest of their games. `\To look at you. If he doesnt respond, yell at Manu to ask curry to do it!`\damn that sequence ..`\> Splash Uncle

ew`\Well if Steph and klay shoot 60% combined and Dame shoots 20% for a series then be my guest and gloat`\Wait you really think the Thunder will win the NBA finals?`\I guess he had to show up after getting rekt by Huertas the night before.`\How much is the Lillard doll with microphone included?`\Fivehead`\Why would /r/nba have a field day when their most beloved player struggles?

A lowlight video for Curry will be like Schindler's List on here`\KOBEEEEEEE!!!!!!!
`\Probably because it wasn't clear when they reviewed it`\Amazing defensive plays from the Spurs. Also shown how good is GSW despite they missing their 3pt shoots. `\Remind me to give you Reddit Silver if this were to happen.  :P`\Klay went bananas in the bay.`\2 games, this was the 2nd (2/2)`\Ehh. Millsap should've ended it with his three. And the Hawks started out OT shooting only threes and bricking them. Then there's the whole Schroeder missing two free throws thing`\Well the Dubs win on skill almost every night so they e got plenty of luck in the bank.`\This is fucking sweet!`\SO MY KIDS DON'T HAVE TO FORAGE jesus fuck what is this commercial?`\HEY WE WERE ON NATIONAL TELEVISION FOR TWO SECONDS`\Kawhi is wet`\Although they played great D the Warriors were simply not hitting the shots they usually always make, oh well a loss is a loss`\GET EM KAT! `\Got it. Thanks!`\Shoot the ball so high on the FB that it splits in half when it hits the rim. `\Probably especially true for Lakers fans from overseas (like me) that follow the NBA. I got into watching the NBA because of Kobe and Shaq like 15 years ago, and soon even Kobe will be gone. I still really like watching basketball but I'm not sure I'll ever be as attached to a team as I was the Lakers with Kobe, considering I have no city or state to feel attached to. `\Dope. Wish he was still with us. `\Kobe Bryant`\can that one be a loss next time yall play them, to nullify this and put us back up by 3.5 games?`\If this happened to Cleveland, kyrie would want to be traded, hiring Lue was the worst decision ever and Lebron would be on his way back to Miami `\bogut might be injured`\i honestly don't think leonard has actually committed a foul this game and has been called for 3`\Duncan didn't look good out there, he was getting hounded by Warriors defense, Pop looks to stay with small line-up`\Really missing Bogut right now. Underrated player.`\The dubs missed a ton of open look threes in the first quarter `\I don't think its fair to call him overrated based off this game because he was sick tonight. Plus if you watch him play he always makes big plays on both ends. That doesnt just go away.`\dude I'm thinking of what to say for that karma. `\Will Danny green ever make a shot again?`\Hey, according to every team we play, refs always favor Warriors.`\I agree just pointing out how useless it is. Seems like he was the reason the Mavs were staying in the game.`\Warriors can't buy a goddamn rebound today.`\Following this game both the Warriors and the Pelicans records are now palindromes. 24-42 for the Pelicans 60-06 for the Warriors. `\Clarkson, way to bail em out`\We woulda been eliminated from the playoffs with a loss today. Finals here we come.

Edit- *ahem* Fuck the Rockets `\How's the pizza pocket?`\It would be replayed throughout the day.`\aldridge fell asleep on that cut jeeze`\lol ridiculous `\We need to get the TOs under control.  We looked seriously sloppy for long stretches.`\Winning is winning.`\Eh. Sometimes, rarely, the worse team wins. Look at LAC vs SA last year. Usually 7 games is enough to guarantee the better team wins but not always.`\But I enjoy having an extra chance to watch away teams. And it's a magical feeling watching 4 different NBA teams play in less than 12 hours.`\He's saying it's hard to do both and that's why it wasn't a blowout.`\Irregardless of who they're cheering for...

Some people are just dumbasses.

As fans

As individuals

As people`\Fitz pretty much, but JB been through the shit for like 30+ years. He gets a pass!!!`\guys we scored 14 points in the first quarter one time`\Hopefully more Draymond rage`\not intentional, curry threw it off his foot`\I liked Rocky IV better.`\We ain't gonna win this if Steph keeps playing like doodoo butter.`\Are you trolling or serious?`\The Goldenstate Warriors remind me of Jonathan McIntosh`\Don't the Spurs hold Curry to an average of like 15 PPG?`\Nance was a sky walker on that dunk. `\GSW needs a another spanking from PDX to wake em up`\Huertas is en fuego`\This thread is annoying, the Warriors aren't drunk, they just got out played.`\https://streamable.com/b0n0`\They took way too long to call this jumpball`\They need to unleash the savior, Mo Buckets.`\Sexy block Livingston`\Yep that's Fitz`\You didn't get a reminder yesterday when the Mavs were within 5 for most of the 3rd quarter? `\>blowout isn't this Spurs' team's style

lead the league in 25+ pt wins and the highest pt differential :)`\SKEWERED`\really?`\secretly, Steve Kerr is Lakers fan`\Yeah, we've been doing it a bit.`\we're doing decent in the third!?`\Ref with all these shit calls for the Spurs. `\Epic epic game. Holy shit`\Going to be pretty tired tomorrow.`\Grit `\Man that was some tremendous defense from both sides. But the NBA old timers will claim the league is soft, these aren't two all-time teams on both ends of the floor, etc. For all the talk of the Warriors, if the Spurs win it all this year, it feels like they won't get their credit as an all-time team, which would be foolish.`\Just tuned in, what the hell is happening?`\Warriors played to not lose the entire game...`\Question: can I add a flair on mobile or do I have to be on a desktop? `\Bad reffing both ways IMO`\People bitching at the refs? Well i never. Not like it happens EVERY GAME THREAD. `\Lol just some friendly ribbing of our forever rivals.`\Kawhi having a great game.

But he is also getting the most defensive pressure I have ever seen him under.

I trust he will respond.`\Last quarter and the score is 0-0. I can't handle this`\So you're saying that Draymond Green is a bad basketball player? `\I'm sure he'll take the travel.`\Well that was a pretty tasty game`\TIL`\WELCOME TO THE SPEIGHT'S JAM!!`\Motherfuckers gonna feel dumb about disrespecting Jaylen Brown`\The game should have ended when Klay missed that shot but refs decided nah.`\Wave actual old guy for guy who just looks old.`\That dunk was dirty `\so fixed lmao`\42 mins damn`\Bleh `\That's basically the formula for every game thread that involves the Warriors. It's civil until halfway through the 4th quarter. All the experts come in raging when it gets close to the end and take no prisoners.`\Deleted`\What do we do with all these Bricks ? `\...are we watching the same game? `\Oh snap`\?`\Fuck Parsons is out for the rest of the game. `\are the Warriors ever going to make a shot?`\I think if they win tomorrow it's pretty much a lock. Everything is really stacked against them, injuries to Iggy, Ezeli, bogut and back to back in San antonio, who hasn't lost at home in 43 games. If they manage to win, they're just that good and then they would only have to go 10-3 with 9 of those games at home.

In addition if they were to win tomorrow, with Spurs being 5 losses back it's very possible POP would just concede it's unrealistic for Spurs to get 1st seed and would probably rest players their next 2 meetings.`\Exactly.`\Most basketball fans would understand that if you consistently put a hand up on a shooter's face and contest then run him around screens, he will eventually tire out and start rushing his shots. The Spurs did a good job making them attack the rim and challenging shots instead of giving up open threes from the high pick and roll.`\Wow curry put up 35 pts like it was nothing. One of the quietest/most effortless 35 pt games I've ever seen.

Mo Buckets put up 25 pts in 18 minutes.

TYBG for the Big Two. `\Name change: Philadelphia SixSeventySixers`\Rudy Gobert `\Lmfao. This is actually ridiculous.`\Dang, that's a sweet pass by Rubio.`\Leonard's getting boned on some of these calls`\Warriors turning the ball over like every other possession`\2015 finals was pulling in 23K`\any other team Barnes would make $5m a year, no more`\Warriors should just tank now imo.`\Popping in my gameday spaghettios lets go boys`\Can't think of another superstar who gets foul calls so easily.

Curry is like a delicate flower out there`\In 2 games`\> Would you not?

Isiah Thomas and Joe Dumars for me. `\MARCELINHO!`\Stu probably had a lot of fun calling this game lol `\lmao curry`\THEY BLOCKED A STEPH THREE!!! THEY FINALLY SOLVED THE CURRY RIDDLE!!!`\Serious question? How will you win against this team the next years? ... haha.. I mean...This is history stuff..`\Do you guys think the Andersons got tickets to this game?`\That was not that bad. It's relevant considering they just lost a game they were up by 20.`\On McAdoo? Curry protected again /s`\Fuck dwill this game`\Spy is funny.   Fite me irl `\how on earth can draymond complain about that? and risk getting a T? For what? Theres no case to be made there man`\I'm broken after those 5 minutes.`\I enjoyed that game despite the loss. GG`\cmon man...`\What a game! Yall locked down Curry incredibly. Great one, SA - hope we can return the favor and later start a winning streak @SA in the WCF!`\Not to mention Danny Green for blocking Curry's shots.`\Yeah I never understood that. Ticks me off every time I watch it.`\Chasing that triple double will be the death of Dray.`\Steph got his 3 point shooting back tonight.`\C'MON DRAYMOND LET THE OLD MAN YAM IT`\Lakers have an incredible chance to beat the best team in the nba and Kibe takes stupid threes..`\Warriors will finish with 25 turnovers. `\what is happening`\curry vs. kobe lowlights or just curry ❓❓❓`\Have the 76ers played all their games against the Cavs yet? If not, hopefully we can get some of this "last place team beating the first place" magic again`\/r/nbastreams`\I'm rooting for GS. I'm not really a neutral though as Curry is my favourite player `\Swallow your whistles refs, we want to see a good game.`\DRAY IS A FUCKING BEAST`\god damn`\Barnes just left Towns alone at the rim to run out to the three point line. He's so bad that it's become hilarious.`\If I took a shot every time Draymond shouted "and one!", I'd be blacked out by now`\Droppin dimes everywhere`\Powell! `\Eat dick Draymond`\I would actually murder a man for Popovich to coach my team.`\I'm sure he did cause we straight creamed 'em in 14.`\Hope Andre is OK. `\GG Warriors `\as a neutral fan I will love the overreactions and anger being tossed around `\And the Spurs are the first to block a Curry 3, officially...`\Frozen Curry`\All They need do to flop against their own players to get free throws `\It will only take him about an hour to get to SA, with all the whistles I'm sure he could make it with a couple mins left in the game.`\/r/nbastreams`\Had some two weeks ago!`\Butt hurt AF. As a lakers fan I realized I've been spoiled, bad seasons happen but you can't take away all our rings `\From reading the thread nobody really complaining that much about Reffing on gsw side`\Yes`\I've proposed this many times.`\SVG is such a fucking cunt

Fuck him`\"Should've signed with the Lakers..."

Now we know`\That's why the NBA is so pussy now. No one from the Jordan era would ever do that....Ohh wait`\Okay!`\That girl walking out on that replay had a sick view of that Curry corner 3 if she would have just turned around..`\The cooking is real`\Not just Bogut, anyone tall.`\alright alright alright `\This game is highlighting how much curry is covered by the rest of the team. Klay is guarding Kobe or clarkson and Russell a rookie is just torching curry. `\Curry pls`\Do you seriously think he wasn't fouled by Manu there?`\Spurs take "Dad D" to a whole new level. `\I think 2.`\Oh my damn they really are trying to do this... `\soccer time`\Steph and Klay combining for 1/17. wtf`\Sooooo, anybody wanna tell him?`\Slap curry on the neck when he's on the bench`\Curry defs got away with one there. JVG on point with the analysis`\Amen`\This is going to be a fun series`\Oh without a doubt. Both teams way below their regular shooting splits. `\Because the Spurs probably have the longest active run of continued success and stability in all of sports except for maybe the Patriots. The Warriors have only been at their current level of dominance for the past two seasons or two. Do not misunderstand, I am taking nothing away from the Warriors but the Spurs are full of guys who were playing together at an extremely high level way before the Warriors were even a playoff team. That's what battle proven means to me. The Spurs are pretty much more battle proven than any other team in the league and it's not even that close. `\Big man now that he got 33% correct lol.`\Actually when Kerr took over, one of the first items of business was passing and cutting down on turnovers.  During training camp, they focused a lot on basic fundamentals of passing

3 point floaters`\It's gay because Mavs are playing knowing that every bump is a foul. Really obvious they way they play on offense. `\Travel #14761924781924789124786 for everyone in the NBA uncalled`\How about you just go away and never come back`\...to join KD in Oakland`\Not when teams decide to defend and contest his shots, doubling him off the pick.

Even moving off the ball he doesn't look right`\K sportsguy11`\This game is ugly so far. `\CLARK BUTTER`\Huertes>>>>curry`\Yeah what the fuck happened today?`\Well it *was* a blowout.`\Barbosa made some really great passes and played great D. HB wasn't a good shooter that night but his effort on the offensive boards allowed the early lead.`\Same people that believe Blake Griffin drives a Kia. `\well if you watched the game you would know he kept us in that game`\Tbh I'm rooting for yall vs CLE`\Most Spurs Fans have hopped on the anti Danny Green bandwagon due to his offensive struggles but his defense in the last two games has been remarkable.`\You can smell it when he's chuckin up a three. `\No`\LOL RUSSELL`\Use those fingers to count all the Warriors' missed threes because I'm running out. `\Like your comment?

Checkmake `\So that thing where they light up the 3pt line when someone takes a three, is that a TV thing or are they doing it in the stadium somehow? Could work either way as far as I can tell, so just curious.`\Anyone have a clip of that?

Edit: https://streamable.com/vpe0 thanks to /u/Perksofthesewalls on /r/Warriors`\staph lavine feed towns`\Yes I watched the game.

I watched the Cavs take a 2-1 lead mostly on the strength of harassing perimeter D and then not be able to sustain that effort. You're much deeper than the Cavs, but it will take an heroic effort to do that over a full best of 7.

I loved watching you win tonight.

And I hate your team mortally.

But it was a head check to the idea that this Warriors team is the greatest ever. An idea which is wrong and chaps my ass.`\Most fans come from bandwagons or hometown fans. What's wrong with liking a team that's also fun to watch? That's how I started with the 3peat Lakers. You guys win a lot too so less heartbreak.`\damnnnn`\Here's what my dad just said. He doesn't watch basketball a lot:

I don't think we can know for sure either way. `\Yes please. `\Most valuable pimple`\Yeah, Towns was the first pick overall this past year.

[Here is this year's rookie class's stats if you want to compare them.](http://www.basketball-reference.com/leagues/NBA_2016_debut.html)

Booker is doing amazing and has a bright future ahead of him, but he's not even top 3. Just goes to show how phenomenal this year's rookies are.`\No, but he did have a good, full career.  And to be fair, nobody was ever this good.`\Bogut trying to join the 60/100/45 club`\Clarkson travels every play `\Varejao is sooo bad.`\well phoenix could salvage the tank if they beat memphis`\We're right here. We can hear you.`\me too. safari`\Would love to see some DWest this game. Solid D on Curry so far, he's just too damn good to bottle up tho `\wtf curry`\That would been beast steal by Leonard`\his poor barber has to cut around the wart`\It's a back to back on the road and they don't have a single center healthy.`\Same with curry.`\Steph and Klay needed to pad their stats a little`\Which side of the bandwagon am I supposed to be on now? The classic or modern side?`\Ya for sure, its been great, i just wanted to emphasize how otherworldly Spurs D has been this season. And your D being 2nd, and O being not so good is pretty surprising.`\Yeah the conference has been weaker but with the Boston Big-3 and the Miami Big-3, the Eastern winner has been just as good as the West's winner. So the WCF hasn't been the finals for those 6 years. The West still won 3 of those titles but they were hard-fought series each time.`\Okay, let's assume that the great defense was due to Lue. Why did it stop as soon as he became head coach?`\yo...what's going on lol `\How come Larry Nance Jr. don't get more PT?`\The problem is were not shooting 3s or playing defense so... not trending well at all`\I'm going to tell my future children about this game. `\That was the most awkward looking floater in the world by Draymond`\So basically you won't do anything? `\Curry needs to just drive to the rim every time.`\This game thread is cancer look at all these random downvotes!
On topic: It's amazing that the Warriors are only down by 6 despite their poor shooting thanks to the Spur's defense. I can't wait for the second half to start!`\Tyus Jones, Andrew Wiggins, Tayshaun Prince, Shabazz Muhammad, and Greg Smith. `\Not at all`\fuck draymond green`\79 points, that's some badass D `\Pretty rare for GSW to shoot like this though`\:(`\Charlie got murdered right in front of the ref..


F`\Holy crap he's 13 days younger than me. I never truly understood the "what am I doing with my life comments" until now.`\why is acknowledging that it was the second game of a road back-to-back while missing some key players an "excuse".

Is it so unreasonable to think that those things might have been the difference in a game that came down to just a few possessions?
`\It was pretty clear that he was referring to this season, where the Warriors are also undefeated at home. Both the Spurs and Warriors play ridiculously well at home.

And the Warriors won in SA in the playoffs in 2013.`\Someone clean the glue off of Randles hands please`\Anyone have a stream? /u/anotherduck`\JVG clowing right now. Hopefully he doesn't go off on a tangent too long...`\Barbosa's showing his experience here. Chaotic game, but he seems to always be in control`\Seriously? The entire quarter? It's been amazing`\wasnt even a travel`\Curry is BROKEN`\I don't, although if I did it would probably be wise to withhold that information. Couldn't blame you for wanting to have a word with them :P`\ernay`\8 more than normal!`\There towards the end, he was going off so much, that I was surprised he didn't get T'd up.

I'm glad he didn't, though. I mean, I hate him, but I didn't want a game like this one to come down to a technical foul`\dang where can i cop those socks? google ain't helping me here.`\Is there a word for a put-back that doesn't fall in?`\LOOKIT THAT HUSTLE`\FIRST TO 100 WINS GG`\I'm not worried about Wolves fans lol.

Watching the Warriors get shat on by the refs.`\Warriors playing horrible on a b2b with key player missing only down 6 not bad`\Curry or Klay needs to heat up and this game will be amazing. No fun when theyre cold`\It's like he's not even trying to hide it. `\Whack Curry and Spurs fans dont even mention it`\I don't usually say this but these refs can suck a phat cawk`\Andre Drummond.`\You guys sure like living on the edge. A Chicago loss would have also eliminated you last night. `\It was like 90-90, wtf happened.`\RIVERWALK IS BACK!`\Anyone got that highlight of the fast break where Livingston goes behind the back to Klay in the corner?`\Vengeance will be sweet. `\What a game to be excited about the playoffs!`\I was referring to the sarcastic and smartass tone of the OP. It was obvious if you watched that CP missed at least 5 open looks, same with JJ.`\One of my favorite wins this season. Great game from the Hawks, I knew they would take us all the way. `\Here me out guys: If warriors win every game for the rest of the season, I think there's a pretty good chance they'll get the record. `\LAKERS REFBALL, JUST LIKE OLD TIMES`\Barnes having a nice game so far`\People would just start calling them "rarfs" or something to get around it.

Sorry, this one's on us.`\foul?`\Iso with Ginobli gets fucked again -_-`\Macadoo looks like he was on high school musical `\HAHAHA yeah that would've changed everything`\Have you heard Beenie's speeches? He says he wants a political revolution over and over. `\Legend has it Barea is still screaming to this day`\lol cmon not that bad`\Time to start drafting centers again `\Nah I don't think anyone would get that reference `\Wow, Chicago fell all the way to the 9th spot.  What a spiral`\The box score tells the story for this game. Wolves bench vs Warriors bench is night and day. Wolves starters vs Warriors starters has been night and day. `\too far`\While I was having this same reaction I clicked the link`\they aren't that good at defense/rebounding`\uffda`\Right? I feel like we haven't even been able to really compete against them when they've been full strength. `\Exposed`\nope..i like Clarkson on your team, so i thiink that is not just a simple hating thing`\If the warriors played like this against a contender they would be down 40`\David Lee is really trying to prove something.

It's annoying`\I want to so bad, but the odds are against us.  I think 67 is doable? We'll see.`\Neither does Curry (except for that one)`\But it's cool if they land on him right? Haha`\Curry looking like 2011 Finals LeBron out there. He's literally disappeared. `\spurs are playing much better than back then`\Yep, I've been blown away by that for like the last decade.`\Warriors laugh and say, "You want a shootout? We'll give you one."`\That too`\Warriors are so out of it,not even the refs can help,its a loss boys`\Refs are blind`\Jesus that's a great idea. Every third comment is bitching about the refs- and that's how it is for every game thread. `\Spurs amazing defense put em out like a fire hose`\I remember he was automatic from the corner early this season`\Haha that was some great stat padding by the Warriors at the end. `\It's perfect karma. I can't wait.`\The problem will be that they will make his skills closer to reality and he will be unstoppable. Not sure how you fix him unless you can code something magical.`\D'Lo 1-on-1 with Curry, the moment I've been waiting for all season.`\I hope people read this. He literally dribbled it off of the guy's foot on accident and people are bitching about bad reffing.

Only bad call I saw this half was the 3 point shot GSW got from the Parker foul. `\If you push a player into a player shooting, it should be a 100% foul. If it's a fastbreak and Kawhi is attempting a layup, while Lebron pushes Parker into him and Kawhi misses. It's a clear shooting foul.`\No more fouls lol! `\It's sad that the only thing that can get our fans into the game is the possibility of free cherry berry.`\Lavine has been clutch for the warriors.`\- Popovich wouldn't try the real strategy he is going to use in the WCF in a regular season game

- 'Jump shooting teams' have that extra psychological burden in close do or die games which makes them 'going cold' more likely to happen.

- The Spurs can certainly play better offensively than in this game

- I don't think they were pushed to "their absolute limit"

I'd give them a 35% chance to win a 7 games series.`\No.. I mean Kobe fans. Laker fans will still go. I get that you're trying to make a joke, but I literally differentiated Kobe fans from true Laker fans. `\Hey bballref guys add Huertas' nickname "The Curry Stopper"`\The Lakers put up 60 in the first half, and the opponents somehow don't have 75?`\> **FUCK THE CELTICS**

One of very few things fans of the Lakers and Heat can both agree on.`\Spurs going to try and run us after last night? Should be a fun start`\Damn. Matthews on my current all defense team. I hope he gon be gud. `\I feel bad for Barnes... trying so hard and can't even hit the lay-up :/ `\Barbosa steals the rebound to deny Steph the triple double.`\But they had bogut not this around tho.`\Duncan played eight minutes off the bench, no excuses here, we beat you down`\Peak use of that GIF lmao`\Clarkson killin' it`\Gotta love the awareness of Shaun Livingston, got a block earlier in the game, and made that saving play there on offense`\Lol this`\I think you're taking it the wrong way. It was a joke, like you [Forgot about Dre](http://genius.com/Dr-dre-forgot-about-dre-lyrics).`\Ricky really stepped up his 3s after that game winner vs Thunder`\HOLY SHIT FOUL?`\Man, shutup JvG. How are you supposed to control yourself in the air like that?`\This feels like game 1 of playoffs`\Maybe that's true. But y'all gave us so much shit when we made qualifiers about not having Duncan. `\We Larriors again. `\Which means he died by it today.`\Don't bother. He's just a curry band wagoner and probably never watched a game of basketball until last year.

Think of it like its your mom. She has no idea about the sport but enjoys watching this light skinned scrawny kid get the ball into the net from really far away. Just let it go`\He has no reason to do that as they are an older team who want to win in the playoffs.`\Well honestly no I tuned in about halfway through the 3rd, so you got me there. My opinion is based on the parts of the game I did see, and maybe colored by the fact that I was watching the Hawks stream.`\Me too, he bricks a lot of shots `\Yep, in Detroit`\Jack left early to get his tacos!`\holy crap the Spurs in stadium announcer lmao`\I'm just amazed at how he continues to develop every party of his game to a high level`\GG`\wow....
i thought the game thread was classy then this came....`\I really didn't realize just how badly I wanted this team to get to 73 wins until I got 9 IPAs in me. `\Lakers on fire from downtown today, damn`\This is destiny. `\warriors farewell gift to kobe. 'grats mamba.`\Mavs are getting every call. I try not to blame the reffing but this is ridiculous.`\The Western Conference Finals is going to be insane.`\I don't think so.

Section 306 last night!`\You've got every call but one this quarter `\The refs drinking some crunk juice or what`\But Curry barely plays because of the blow outs /s`\Why would you switch off ball and give up a huge mismatch? `\That hardcore henry shit's a joke right...

But only a little bit, because anything was better than Cohan.`\Bogut had a great game. A Bogut dunk is the second greatest thing to a curry 3.`\Because the real reason is the dubs got out played with who was available. there is no certainty that you win with them and not off a back to back but what is certain is the dubs lost last night. Any comment other than the spurs played better than the dubs in favor of the dubs is an excuse. I have no idea why its so hard for you guys to give credit to the spurs instead of coming up with what ifs. Plenty of peeps gave the dubs credit when they beat us even though we were short Timmy and LMA had his worst game of the season. `\Did they just bleep out JC lol?`\The greatest thing of all time.`\There is still more than 2 quarters to go..`\Every game will be different. It's dumb draw major conclusions from one game. What did the first Cavs vs GSW game indicate about the the second? Absolutely nothing.`\I don't get it. Can you explain more?`\Steph leads the league in steals now`\that's not really his role though. Speights and Shawn usually lead the bench in scoring while Iggy plays point forward, Barnes' role, whether this is good or bad, doesn't really change depending on who's out there.`\These refs are fuckin whack `\OH BABY`\tbf there would be no KD talk if he signed that`\And so it begins. Warriors lose this game and end up falling short of the Bulls record. This creates a tone of negativity which leads to them suffering a monumental loss to the Clippers in the 2nd round. Spurs beat the Clips in the WCF and go on to beat the Cavs in the Finals. Duncan retires with 6 rings. `\bogut!`\That game was WEIRD`\fucking randle man SMH`\We're back baby!

My heart...`\FUCK THE CLIPPERS!`\Okay I'm about to collectively jerk off the entirety of the GSW fanbase:

From what I've seen, you don't beat the Warriors. When they lose, it means they beat themselves (and that doesn't happen much).

Before the all-star break I'd say that the Warriors aren't a shoo-in to win it all if everyone freezes up during the playoffs. Well, everyone has frozen since the all-star break, and look how that's working out.

It takes a 1-12 game by Stephen fucking Curry for them to lose to the Spurs. Honestly, this is the best team to play since the 1996 Bulls and arguably the best team the NBA has ever seen. Looking through their roster, every single player is an above average passer (except Mo) and they have so many shooters that everyone can get an open shot. Their defense is exceptional and Kerr is an incredible coach. There's just nothing you can do to stop this team. If they lose it's because they played poorly.`\Was just a joke lol`\Thank god, must feel nice to be able to rest him today and come out with a win.

GL with the rest of your games, I'm enjoying watching you guys play. `\This really bad joke needs more love, dammit`\Warriors played the first half like it was a practice game and then didn't bother to pick it during the second half.`\Maybe the only positive for us: at least it wasn't a home game.`\Are you sure you don't wanna call that on Kawhi too?`\hahahaha...nah, we would hug it out and eat some bomb chips and queso!`\Found Riley Curry's reddit account.`\This is probably a second-round playoff team without Steph which is a fucking ridiculous thing to say when you don't have an MVP on the floor.

WTF`\Klay showing up for that OT and that OT only


Speights is a splash cousin too`\Since new years its been close with Spurs, but overall even though ur 2nd, its not even close to Spurs historic D.`\I like you`\will curry have more points or kobe shot attempts?`\Was I the only one who saw that curry travel? `\Dubs already scored more than some NCAA games /s`\yes`\Possible but there is almost 100% chance that he gets 2+ wide open ones. Happened every game due to offensive boards or fast breaks.`\I swear to God, Danny Green is the greatest fast break defender in the NBA. He always managed to blow up a fast break whether it's LeBron & Wade or Curry & Klay`\Y'all aren't attacking the basket what do you expect `\it's a violation, not a foul`\And PS I don't like asking there cos they seem to get real salty about gore. Like, they act like you're a prancing nancy if you ask about gore.`\100% from 3 in his Warriors career`\That Kendrick bass riff is so nice.`\if Currys airball gets called an assist I'm out`\Dubs shot 3-30 from 3.`\Jim Pete is my favorite... listening to Minny stream for this reason. `\every team does that against us`\The DEFENSE! Switch has been turned on!`\we're not even playing that good, if steph and klay were shooting any way close to normal wed be so down`\Should just give up now`\Seriously?`\That's actually really cool Russell showed restraint to guarantee the layup. For a rookie that's really mature.`\Thompson has missed open shots

But they've locked up curry pretty good so far`\3-29 from three and 20 turnovers. What a joke of a game by the Warriors`\Because that's what Pop wants.`\Spurs came ready to play, I don't see any passion from the Warriors at all. Draymond needs to get them fired up after halftime`\A great game by Jeremy Lin, 29 points, man. He took charge in that game`\Ken Mauer is the worst, holy shit`\You can stream it from espn themselves. just google it`\if you combine Wiggans and KATs age its younger then Garnett, and have contributed 48 points this game`\lol, cheers you bastard.`\Because you guys decide to triple team Curry. `\Games where he shoots 2/9 or 1/12 could probably be considered below average`\Yes, I'm a spaniard that has studied political marketing and I wanted to have a serious discusson about American politics and was surprider that r/politics is basically r/berniesanders.

The interesting thing in the US electoral campaign, from a political marketing point of view, is precisely the Trump campaign and not the Sanders one. But it seems that people fail to understand the first and basic point which is: What Trump says is probably not what he thinks (maybe he does maybe he doesn't), it is what his team thinks is going to be the most beneficial to him and reap more votes.

People shouldn't say that Trump is wicked and racist, they should wonder why such a wicked and racist speech works. Politics is just a game of identifying needs and desires in society.
`\Lol, Pops timeouts are so weird but amazing.`\It doesn't bother me that much, but it is incredibly unnecessary`\The offensive player has to be able to land after his shot without being landed on also, lol.`\the level of hatred in this thread is crazy.`\Hey Aldridge be careful, don't laugh... They'll call a tech for it.`\You also had a ton of turnovers and Timmy didn't really play.  I give the Warriors the slight edge in a playoff match up (especially with home court) but the Spurs def could win a series against them.  `\I eagerly anticipate the detailed breakdowns of what the Spurs did on defense that Michigan State didn't.`\try to keep up`\http://imgur.com/lrLj8Vx`\Curry banked a 3 from the corner

O_o`\No, just calling out something unfair. `\Oh yeah, hit the one after the whistle Curry. Maybe you should start hitting them when they count`\If Curry got the fouls he deserved  every game, he'd average 35+

Edit: And the refs continue the bullshit with that foul call on Kawhi`\well...Kerr did want more travel calls.`\So sick of having whether or not the shot goes in spoiled by the stupid audio being out of sync. `\WOW NO FOUL????`\Welcome to the club
`\That's such a cop out excuse.

`\Part of that was great perimeter defense, but also a consequence of the Spurs slowing the pace, eating clock, and preventing fast breaks. Warriors and Curry never got into an offensive rhythm. The other half was 34 minutes of fast paced basketball against an energetic Mavs team, with the last half being Curry pretending to be human so the league doesn't catch on.  `\Yeah KAT was rolling to the basket with Klay on him and plenty of that time on the shot clock at the end there.

Nene has a decent percentage with them but most teams know to lock down the paint against us bc we really only have 2 solid 3 PT shooters, hopefully Otto will continue his development during the offseason.

don't know who decided Ariza should go. but a player like him is what this team needs to allow Wall to drive, Beal not to be constantly guarded on the outside and Gortat and Nene to do more post up moves w/o being double teamed often leading to a foul. `\Whats the yam?`\9/12 from 3 is such a ridic stat line`\Curry is unreal, but he was also one of the main reasons the game stayed close. With three minutes to go and the dubs up 9 this was his game:

1) Missed 3, Bogut rebound, Curry missed jumper, Orlando comes down and scores

2) Turns the ball over (not sure if they gave it to Bogut), falls asleep on D, allows Jennings to burn him and get to the line (missed one FT)

3) Green TO, Dipo 2 points

4) Curry misses another shot, Dipo comes down and scores 2 FT to make it a 2 point game

5) Nearly turns it over, gets bailed out by an act of god and a Clay 3 to make it 5 again.

6) Bogut gets the steal to ice the game, Curry with break-away layup.

I do hate the Spurs, as in the team. The fans haven't really bothered me personally. I hate that they have a systemic history of players (excluding the marquee guys - you know who I mean) that have been coached and instructed to injure opposing players as part of their game plan.

Parker and Green took 4 steps 3 or 4 times between them in the 4th alone. I feel bad for people who devote themselves to being a fan of this game, cuz no matter how good your team is, NBA refs can just fuck you apparently.`\allow me to introduce, blade, laser, blazer, and Klazer.`\One situation does not cause another. Them having off nights or possibly getting locked up does not change the fact that tonight OUR players were actually just missing open shots.`\they are having either the best or 2nd best regular season of any team in nba history.`\WHY DIDN'T THEY FOUL??!!`\You could say this about 10 of their wins this season. Doesn't change anything though because they still take care of their business when it mattered.`\Fuck I just joined onto the game...how are we even remotely competitive with the Warriors?

I mean we got Kobe and Clarkson back but what happened?`\The best part is, he flew to new york to "spend time with me" and decided we'd watch the game together instead of seeing the city.`\Crab dribble`\This may sound weird..but why does it look like the Spurs aren't trying?

In their last few games you see them give so much freedom to Kawhi. And now once he gets the ball he immediately passes it

And it also seems like the Warriors aren't really going at it that much either which could explain Kerr's weird tech as he tries to fire his team up

This game just seems so relaxed`\Curry just did the Chris paul`\Steph looks tired`\Lol wiggins single handedly threw this game for the wolves with that chunk up shot, and then missed free throw. He should feel bad. Really bad.`\I'm trying to picture this...like, holding the bread and doing an underhand knife maneuver? `\Getting a little carried away there from 20 minutes of basketball by a depleted warriors on the road in game 2 of a b2b, lol`\Lots of contact there`\why is that a foul for Harden every time but its never a foul for Klay or Green?`\I literally keep hearing cans of beer being cracked in the background `\The refs gotta be consistent. If they didn't call the foul the Curry block, don't call a ticky tack foul on Kawhi on the steal. Or if you do, make sure you're calling the game tight all-around. `\holy shit, trading threes `\Sure, I was going off his reaction, but you might be right.`\Drink!`\I'm not sure if it was Draymond who inbounded the ball, but at the end someone inbounded it all the way down court to Barnes and he just stood there. I get that it's out of respect for the enemy team but I would much rather give my team mate a triple double.`\But can they beat the Lakers on a cold, rainy Sunday night in Los Angeles?`\That dray 3 at the end definitely killed the morale of the hawks`\AIR FRANCE`\Looks like this one might play out this way for the entire game. Too many mistakes and Lakers are making them pay.`\This might be an unpopular jumping the gun but I think this game and the nuggets loss are gonna cost the Warriors the record. `\He's had more off nights than on`\> Gonna be a ~~physical~~ GREAT game

FTFY`\He can turn that faucet on any minute. `\They said he's only gotten 8 mins so far.`\Green needs to calm the hell down. The refs are letting him get away with his constant yapping, but he's going to get T'd up soon

/go spurs`\https://streamable.com/kub4`\Thanks John. Let's go down to the court now and see who's basketballing harder. `\Mo Speights and Brandon Knight showing up! `\i'd have to see a doctor after my erection lasted longer than 4 hours.`\is that Facebook God?  That dude fucking rocks!!!`\I like this Huertas dude`\This has to be the worst the Warriors have played this year.`\What a great day for basketball`\Pretty sure Gobert blocked one earlier in the year.`\Odd that you analyze another man that much`\Go fuck yourself you piece of shit.`\Ew, like the NFL?`\Thanks Spurs! Now we are only 12.5 games out of the first seed! Oh and the spurs are only two games. Which again still blows my mind. `\I was expecting better shooting from Lillard and Klay played really well tonight.`\"Look at me. I'm the Splash Brother now"

--Draymond Green`\What the hell is going on?`\in the end, lakers get us `\And Manu makes the 3`\how`\John Wall and Klay get pissy`\Now imagine pop doing that to Craig Sager when his biggest hero, Alan Greenspan walks by. `\Give me the warriors in the WCF`\pls klay`\Curry shot just as bad as his new drill video made him look.`\Curry hating and McGregor hating has never been so fashionable. I like it...`\No Bogut, no Iggy and no Festus. Im concerned `\Damn, Steph getting mugged with no call. `\Nah he was decent from '09-'13. Nothing huge, but servicable.`\who says no? `\Batum was gone either way. They didn't want what was happening with LMA to happen to Batum. He's an inconsistent UFA. We wanted to get something of value (Vonleh) so that we have pieces to build around Lillard with, rather than giving Batum way too much money to be mediocre

If you're paying Batum a max, you won't ever win a championship

We did get a traditional PF though -- Ed Davis. And he's a monster; really good small ball C too`\First All-NBA selection, now MVP votes for Klay, huuuh Jalen?`\Wow I have the same headphone as Steph's!`\Mo "The Great Wall of China" Speights.`\I see Warriors fans can't take a loss...wow. If the Warriors don't shoot lights out from 3, they lose.`\I will never not upvote this. `\Before his injury this year. I think they replaced him with a lookalike`\My bad I forgot you guys traded it.`\He made a dunk on a cut to the basket`\Curry stood up after that Livingston pass like, am I having an out of body experience?`\If we didn't turn it over so much... maybe they wouldn't be within 6 points D:`\look. at. that. fuckin'. pass.
`\ooh not a mav fan but that was legitness`\It was awesome seeing him finally get his ring. When the Celtics released him I was very scared he'd end up somewhere that had no more games in Oakland, and he'd miss his chance to get it in front of Oracle.`\Look if you want to talk shit about my favorite player, that's fine. Just know that it doesn't really make me feel good about myself. `\theyre calling handchecking on curry a lot more these past few games`\Just a nod to South Florida. What the heck is soflo antonio?`\Why would anybody throw that much at Barnes, he's not worth that. `\Warriors about to lose to the Lakers!`\Can someone tell me what the fuck is going on, I just turned the game on`\Ayyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy lmao`\WOLVES!`\Shit that was dangerous...`\Guys, look! Everyone who lives in Utah is Mormon!`\every NBA basketball game played in Reddit era has had this exact comment in it (swap out team names of course).  I get it...NBA refs suck.  But holy shit, we just watched two of the top teams to play in our lifetime go head to head.  There were only 28 free throws shot combined.  Warriors shot 10.  This is what people have been asking from the refs since forever (let the players play), and people still bitch of course. `\*e`\2`\Wtf was that`\Whoah.   First start of his career right?   I can't remember him ever getting 20 minutes in a game, let alone starting`\McGrindfather`\Oops, that's what I meant. I get my VG initials switched sometimes.`\LAC vs. MEM will be a great series`\IMMOVABLE OBJECT`\finals mvp? lol

`\You mean Jarry Jergich?`\I turned this game on, and I don't get to watch gsw often, only to see JMM get four straight pick and rolls called for him. What was that?`\bogut on 2/7/7 please get a triple double!`\Chill dude we're winning and Young has been money lol`\Im so fucking hyped`\Gotta admit that was very satisfying to see from curry`\Try opening it on safari if you're using an app`\mcadoo playing like he doesn't belong`\Get the starters in! `\W A T`\Maybe season stats, not game stats`\Lol`\He'll change to another pair of shoes!`\Awe, did baby want a foul call?`\I assume you are being facetious`\lol the warriors will still break a record even if they lose`\Fuck.`\Same here`\I wouldn't call the officiating so far biased in our favor lol`\Wonder what you said when they got blown out by the Lakers`\NEVER AGAIN (except tonight) `\No Bogut, No Ezeli, No Iguodala, Thompson and Curry have one of their worst shooting games of the season but we still came down fighting. GG Spurs :) `\Meh, every game is different and the refs were on their side. Unfortunately, they will likely always be on their side because refs in this league favor smaller players over bigger and stronger players.`\The Raptors haven't beaten the Spurs in San Antonio during the playoffs since 1977.`\The entire 3rd and beginning of the 4th I was just waiting for the Warriors to come back `\If it was Harden it would be on front page right now
`\Did the abc announcers just say clarkson is an excellent defender? Ha`\Still bad`\I don't mind it since DLo and JC basically bounce from the 2 to the 1 depending on how well they're shooting. Having him stagger with them off the bench might not be a bad idea`\Okay add Knicks then to the top line. `\He's selfless like that.`\Defense won this game`\Jesus Klay has a short memory`\Kevin Hart got in his head`\Harrison Barnes is crap on both ends`\I wonder if either team is gonna score more than 100 this game`\Their D is fine. They just aren't scoring anything like they normally do and are only down 6`\Sage Steele would be a great name for a hermaphrodite porn star.`\I'm visiting my granparents in a little ass town in the middle of nowhere. I barely have any service`\Dont feel special. they suck for both teams`\Offensive rebounding is going to be the Warriors' Achilles hill in the playoffs. But then again, Curry shooting this badly is an anomaly.

Just wishing for Spurs vs Warriors WCF.`\no other player in the league I love to see lose more than Draymond Green `\I think we can believe that Curry still a human.`\I think tonight was the first time we saw a team LEGITIMATELY beat Golden State
`\Still loves me some Bass.`\I got bell satellite on channel 1201`\Byron Scott is coaching this team to a win. Incredible`\Yes, don't let the 55 wins fool you, we are a 1st round exit`\Spurs taking advantage of the small lineup`\GS' defense needs to step up. `\That's it, own the paint `\I don't give a shit what an announcer says. They definitely shut him down.

He may have been cold, but he went 1-12, and Thomspon went 1-7... if you don't think the Spurs caused that, you're hilariously wrong`\I know he's a KAT but he should be a GOAT`\Are you fucking kidding me`\I mean like the fans doing the howl. Can't really do a good whinny myself lol.`\I love you.`\So, how is your morning? `\Obviously...`\Never said 'in'. I said 'from'. If you're not from there then that makes you a bandwagon fan, which is ironic given how much shit you're spewing about Warriors bandwagon fans.`\well hes playing against speights so`\of all the calls...`\Wow this went from a somewhat close game to a fucking blowout without minutes, damn! Anyways hats off to the Dubs.`\they shouldn't in the first place most of them are bullshit chucks.`\Lol are you really going to try and call me out for using the word disingenuous but then turn around and casually drop "regression to the mean", which is a phrase that is rampantly used more on this sub than anywhere else in the world?

Also, fyi regression to the mean isn't some magical catch-all phrase. I don't think the Dubs are likely to regress to the mean against the Spurs because the Spurs play much better defense than every other team in the league does. Shooting percentage isn't an isolated variable. It's greatly affected by the strength of your opponent's defense. `\I live in Dallas so I'm half-hoping they make 8th just so I can watch`\You take that back you math hating bastard!`\Literally checked to see if it was April 1st even though I know that's like a month away `\If the Lakers somehow lead by halftime, I will not sleep even if I have school, it's 5:30am I have to leave my house at 9 then be at school at 11.

Who needs sleep when you can watch the Lakers magically beat the Warriors?`\What percentage chance do they have of beating 72-10 now?`\these fucking refs lol, trying to hand GSW a win or something`\So that guy who bet the Sixers with $500 to cover made a killing tonight?

Good on you, takes some balls to put that money on the line even when given historic type betting lines`\So far, all Draymond does is back up the shit he talks.  The same cannot be said for the Clippers. It would be hilarious if they don't make it out of the first round.`\Robots don't get the flu..

Dray confirmed neither robot nor MJ.

`\Shits fucking weird man. I legit have to catch myself thinking negatively of a possibly great candidate because of his supporters. They don't get that they're doing much more harm then good.`\Pull the starters, we have a game tomorrow`\Kerr's just screaming at Bass for a blown assignment.`\Watch the Warriors bench bring them back`\Chuck is gonna love this`\Calls are calls. `\he's blurzilian.`\Shannon Brown monster block https://youtu.be/U6c3wibswBQ`\Stop making Raptors fans look stupid. `\Duuude... at first I thought this was so cruel... but it ends up being so perfect`\Fans want reasons to hate him. His play has gotten better in recent games. `\Boris reaching the next level of butteriness `\oh god you're gonna have a field day with another set of klay and steph lowlights`\They're homers, but they're honest.`\He jokingly said in his post game interview that he couldn't miss tonight haha. Glad he got a sense a humor about a tough shooting night `\More like Vin-dementia at this point`\BASS ATTACK !!!!`\Can't believe this mismatch was a national game smh`\I...I don't know what to think. We fucking won? Could this be our year? I mean I'm still waiting for the 4th quarter implosion and the game has been over for 15 mins. `\RUN RUN RUN!`\OH MY FUCKING GOD`\No need to worry, I'm sure the Clippers can help you with that. `\For that I'll never not up vote your shit \#ipromise `\Curry 1-12 from three. Holy shit. That Spurs defense.`\I'd like to beat GSW on their historic run.`\Adolf? Himmler? Hope you know they were right wingers like yourself. Your education has failed you miserably.

Also, never said you're white. Regressive = white only in your small mind.

BTW if you're not from Texas then doesn't that make you a bandwagon fan? So besides being regressive and uneducated you have to deal with being a hypocrite. My contempt for you is now just pity. Life must be terrible having to carry all that burden.`\I am an Atlanta sports fan. I enjoy pain. You can't hurt me Millsap. `\/r/politics might as well be /r/fuckhilaryclinton at this point. anything not favoring Bernie is just downvoted`\ayy fam`\May the team that executes better win.`\Wow...again? Anything to stop the Warriors fastbreak I guess`\Dubs are so off tonight.`\Fuck`\those are almost always callēd since you can't determine intent on that...lma got crossed and ball hit his leg.`\True but teams are playing better defense on him and its opening up klay to score like crazy. `\Don't forget Rush man.`\Getting out-Warriored`\gsw lookin lethargic`\This is excellent.`\And the Lakers are about to beat you by 20. Ergo, the Lakers are better.

See why that kind of thinking is beyond stupid?`\No cause I'm jealous at how consistently good you guys have been for the past 20 years.`\It'd be REALLY weird to see Kevin in here.  Or maybe I'd assume his drunk ass just forgot what sport he was supposed to be botting `\Yeah. Don't think you're special.`\I keep saying, Barnes is garbage.  He crazy if he wants +20 mil a season.`\But we had a Morris twin at the time. And to be honest, Horny and Watson were trying to appease him the entire season to up his trade value.`\Whoa clarkson easy now`\Livingston is so god damn OP`\You Warriors fans are fucking ridiculous.`\That was a kick ball.`\He definitely will, not worried about that`\Expecting him to play well in every single game he plays in is ridiculous `\I missed the first half so didn't see most of that but this half he hasn't played with his usual edge. `\Hadn't seen Rush in a pressure game til tonight....now I am ok (er) about letting HB walk.`\It was clearly sarcasm referring to that lmao. I thought it might be Flagrant 1.`\I shouldn't have to`\Key to beating the Warriors: Someone needs to warm their icy hearts with a hot island song.`\Meh. They are just ok in my opinion.`\Is this real life?`\LMA has been the fucking man today`\Eh. He was super cold for a couple of games vs Houston last year. They won a couple of games.

Then he stopped and they never looked back.`\Good lord. You're more than a casual observer of the guy. How did you acquire all this wisdom?`\Every game is different. Calm down. Playoff games between the two are a long way off.`\LOL not sure how you got any of that from this game, but sure why not.`\What makes you think he'll be ahead of Swaggy P? `\Knight though...`\someone hire this person`\Found you TRUMP.`\have to show up back in your hometown.

same for Lillard`\I'm just here for the memes.`\GG, that's game.`\It's insane that there's a team that might finish the season with the best record ever, yet you can argue that there's a team better than them.`\maybe you're a jinx. `\Should demand the ball more at the end of games.`\Klay

went

bananas

in

the

Bay`\woosh x2`\You must not watch a lot of Laker games our defense is actually really good `\That's true, but that doesn't mean we should be trying to get him for $20m. `\klay knocked it out of his hands, dont know why though, bailed out clarkson by doing it`\**Nobody beats ~~Vitas Gerulaitis~~ the Lakers ~~17~~ 4 times in a row.**`\Aldridge gotta heat up!`\Unbelievable. `\Spurs are playing great D but jeez are refs cheesing us out last two games
`\PARKER DID SOMETHING`\The Wolves commentary is so much better, that's how I'm watching right now`\DISRESPECT`\Woulda been cool if the Warriors weren't on the tail end of a back to back. Oh wait, next time they are as well. These games don't mean shit. Fuck off Spurs.`\Except literally everyone is turning it over`\Klay's 3s are more like "lol wut" 3s than fuck you 3s.  I don't think I've ever seen Klay get angry at anyone except himself.  `\Are you a mathmagician?`\The addition of Curry takes that pathetic offensive performance to the greatest offense of all time. GOAT`\that Sunday game is another tail end of a back to back with the Spurs after a day off. `\ITS OVER LADIES AND GENTLEMEN`\and he did the walk away thing again`\Who's that?`\##BLOWMO`\Very fair `\>  you don't beat the Warriors. When they lose, it means they beat themselves

Not entirely true. I'd say The Pistons legitimately beat us. Spurs too although we were short three players. Curry's 1-12 was the direct result of their excellent defense. `\Fok u m8, they aren't true fans `\For every team`\Zebras.`\I agree but that is still not going to win anyone 6moty. The guy with the best numbers off the bench tends to win. Look at all the past winners.

http://www.basketball-reference.com/awards/smoy.html`\Spurs shot poorly too.`\Any repair bills yet? He seems really good at pulling wool over ones eyes. `\Oh don't worry, that's not a team `\Thanks bro`\The fuck am I supposed to do. Watch March Madness and NBA at the same time? `\Good job Warriors players.`\WE DEM BOYZ`\it's BS that these guys can't play each other in the finals.. totally in favor of getting rid of conference based playoff seeding.`\Its a win if the refs didnt spot the spurs 17 points... `\Ah, yes. The Kevin Durant ratio.`\it seems like, at least this season, when the Spurs and Warriors face off, the home team is gonna win`\Very true.`\Got me some shiner bock and my Duncan jersey. Lets kill the Warriors. GSG `\man everytime julius puts the ball down i'm like here we fucking go again...`\Huertas is ballin`\shrug, all i know is bandwaggoners may be bad for reddit but theyre great for teams and the nba, lots of money and attention brought to it, thats usually a good thing`\STEPH `\That wasn't a fool lol. `\That's nuts.`\ayyyyyyyy. k`\Klay looks so confused. They just let Spurs players grab onto him at one end, but he can't even touch anyone when he's on defense.`\http://www.ducking.xyz/kwak/
`\Time to tank.`\Y'all lied to me and said Curry was better than Josh Richardson.`\Hahahahahahahaha `\WTF I WAS PROMISED A BENCH GAME! `\Just weighing in, I think it defeats the whole purpose to include makes. You don't want to see misses in a highlights video after all.`\Agreed. His shot may have been off this season but his D never wavered! Here's to an even better second half of the game `\Thank-you Greg Popovich for Corey Joseph. Toronto thanks you... Stick it to these perimeter shootin "warriors." GO SPURS!! `\What a joke of a comment. It was a bad Foul but it has nothing to do with curry. He gets mauled and doesn't get the call all the time. Multiple times in this game even

Just because you hear JVG say it doesn't mean it's true `\Mo Speights is in a Spurs jersey though!!`\That's what happened last year and the Ws got an easy ride to a 'ship.`\Nah, I've already drunk a few jugs when MSU went down.`\maybe these kobe socks are lucky`\Curry just broke physics.`\Our boys looking tired and nervous. But good on them for closing the gap there.`\Kerr doesn't know what a pivot foot is...`\Yeah Curry was fouled. No question.`\Curry gets no love when it comes to contact under the basket.`\That one last fairly large contract. `\Back to back on the road, Missing three key players no Center, Curry with a bad night and kept it close. Spurs should be embarrased. Not even worried.  Down vote me if you agree.`\  The Dubs had their best three players on the court.  you gotta hand it to the Spurs on this one.`\Holy fuck Sage looks great`\This is really just a normal Spurs half. We mostly come back in the 2nd half`\It was ater a clean block lmao`\*knock on wood*`\GG Spurs!  Lots of bitching in this thread from everyone, but at the end of the day, I'm glad to have watched some crazy basketball.  `\he also missed a bunch of very makeable (for curry) shots. spurs played great but steph's not gonna go 1-12 very often `\much credit to spurs defense.`\FUCK THE WARRIORS

GO LAKERS GO`\Besides the fact that we beat them by 20`\Barnes' best looking 3 in a long time. `\8 mins`\/r/nba loves to shit on their favorite players

see - lebron`\That's the thing about us this year, I don't know who I don't want out there. There's so many seemingly-useful dudes. Shit, even CV had a 2014 throwback game. `\Curry reserving some energy for some birthday action tonight.`\Because Paul Walker is dead mate`\They were 1 Milsap three away.

I'm on board with this movement`\oh shit, we're playing basketball now? `\how many people changing their warriors jersey to a lakers one in the stands. need more gifs`\Yeah. We'll give  Tony that shot all day `\That's a bad call. But makes up for the 3 they took away from dray for no reason `\The refs are the real MVP of this game, Spurs won because of their bullshit calls and the Warriors didn't have Bogut or Igoudala, this loss doesn't qualify as shit`\That's like, his thing. Or whatever he calls it `\I can't believe how many times I've seen the Warriors bite really hard on pump fakes.`\I've never loved the Lakers more.`\GO KINGS GO !!!`\The hell Nance? SHOOT IT!`\I agree

He needs space it seems. I think he'd function better with set plays called for him because it always seems like someone is in his way leading to turnovers. `\This has been promising so far.

We just can't afford to come out of the half flat like we have a habit of doing.`\This thread is so busy it's not even fun :/

Refs are __always__ making shit calls, but it's not unbalanced.`\GREAT game T-wolves. `\for shame`\Been waiting all year for both Steph and Klay to get hot in the same game. This game was it. `\Against the team that the first comment I replied to was referring to, that's why I said it. He didn't mention Klay, thats why Idk why it matters. but anytime you say anything remotely bad or against Curry or GSW you get downvoted lol I was just saying that Dame doesn't have to prove he can score against GSW tonight cause he did it last week.`\[ANYTHING IS POSSIBLE!](http://static.tumblr.com/t3vcfnk/M4im6us6j/garnett_gif.gif)`\It's implied, buddy.

You guys have some all stars.  Its the bench that really seals games for you guys.

That's why it sounded like a violation`\ok that was clearly A FUCKING FOUL STFU DRAYMOND`\Honestly Steph was this covered the first game. Missed at least 10 shots he usually hits :( Just tired and didn't have his legs tonight


Solid Spurs defense all around though`\I thought we were safe here`\I'm not surprised motherfuckers`\WOOOOOO GET PUMPED BITCHES`\Warriors are shooting 75% from 3 (9-12) and 61.5% from 2 (16-26).`\Since he deleted his twitter the last time we played you. `\This Spurs defense is a beauty to watch. My feetpads are sweaty.`\What the fuck.`\Biased refs back for the Warriors.`\After the shot clock`\True I just notice Bogut a lot more. Also what is this like 6th game in 9 days? They are only human so not surprisingly they shot poorly either. Either way this is going to be a fun match up in the playoffs neither team showed there true potential. `\Who's grabbing who?

 Steph strolled from half court through 4 blue uniforms that were glued to the floor, to the basket, and the game was over.

That might be the craziest thing I've seen this year, in a year where deep buzzer beaters aren't crazy anymore.

I think it was at 2:30 to play*.  Am I tripping?  Did the crowd just stun the Mavs?

*edit-At 3:40 to play`\Who scored 500 for the Sixers?? I missed the game.`\WE ARE THE BEST TEAM IN THE LEAGUE RIGHT NOW PACK YOUR BAGS WE ARE NBA CHAMPS`\Always thought Hockey refs were bad, but goddamn.`\FOR NOW!!!!

Im praying he comes back for another exciting thunder matchup on thursday`\Draymond fucking up`\Effort honestly`\Steph missing from Clarkson range`\Duncan to GSW confirmed`\Says you like hearing the truth.`\Aldridge can't score on bogey. With dray it's BBQ chicken. `\I would settle for one victory in a seven game series.  `\That three game win streak though.`\Welcome `\this year i think`\It's a nationally broadcast game and it's a weekend.  Lots of casual/band wagon fans in here. `\> Are you still there Stephen? It's me, God

Fixed`\Have all the respect for the Warriors, they are on the top for a reason. We (Spurs) played well but could have been better. I still believe the warriors are the team to beat. There a team or deserves the respect for there game play and attitude throughout the few seasons. I hope the Spurs and warriors fight it out in the WCF they both deserve the chance. `\Nah b`\only ignorant fans will point out FT disparity. It all has to do with how much a team drive or how talented a team is. The warriors shot a ton of duds, missing open shots all night and didnt get fouled as much as the spurs did. simple as that, but i think the spurs should have got more with all those fouls the warriors NEVER get called for`\I think the oracle would literally explode if he had made that 3.`\Randle finally made one`\Nick Young is the future of the NBA. New logo coming soon. `\Did this really just happen?! What a game.`\This may be one of the most watched games of season `\Open your browser on your mobile device, open /r/nba in desktop mode on your phone/tablet's browser, then change your flair.`\no body would survive man.`\Troll from the Stickum clan`\Ayyyyy`\I wish this was the finals matchup`\I don't think people hated on the Mavs. `\Kevin Love, Dwight Howard, Horford, Gasol, DeRozan, and Batum off the top of my head. Andre Drummond is restricted and seems to fit in too well to leave Detroit`\Making history `\27 actually... lol I was there. One of the best games I've been to :P`\Where's the game ball? `\Congrats on the Pizza Pocket. How was it?`\I don't think I did ever include makes, lol. But it's not a bad idea, I agree, I think all full lowlight videos should include misses. However, it does take away from some of the humor to have makes. but it's not a bad idea, i might start doing that`\Dray needs to start trash talking DLee`\What the absolute fuck was that shot`\Or klaymen `\"I need one in black and one in a slightly darker black" `\Allow me to just hand you the fucking ball please`\Bullshit like this that makes this sub toxic `\I get what you're saying, and I am honestly not trying to be cocky, but it's be suprising if any of the Warrior's playoff series go longer than six games`\good for you man. I'm gonna go see him this month for my bday! hope he plays :)`\I do, we've played like dog shit all game`\TACOS`\What the hell. I come home and it's 2010 apparently in LA.`\RIP Magic`\God damnit someone please get Sam Mitchell a tailored suit`\Pop has been standing for a long time too.  Very uncharacteristic of him.`\he's gotta stop getting fouled by his teammates and not getting calls`\Draymond Draymond Draymond what was you expecting?`\I'm not watching this game.

Dude shoots from his face lol`\I can not wait for the Warriors fans to spin this one.`\It's weird but I have no real hate for them other than they are always good. I playoff series or two could change that quickly.`\All the great looks Danny green has had and he hits the 3 after almost falling over.`\Barnes why?`\Stfu troll. It was an amazing game on both teams part. Move on. `\saLt`\Gonna have to change your end year date to 2008 since in 2009 is when we started drafting good w/ Steph`\The Lakers are the Warriors Raptors if you remember 96.`\He doing alright so far`\No travel.

LeBron`\Remember the clippers talking all that shit before the season? `\so you agree?`\Not sure if anyone has commented yet, but we don't play OKC again this years.`\Atlanta misses so many open shots, it is unbelievable. `\And this is why it's hard to win 72 games`\I think so. I was reading an article just a couple of days ago that said he hadn't had one blocked at the three point line yet.`\dude got held by duncan and grabbed by d,green `\Since almost every Dubs 3/4 shot is is good or close I expected Parsons to be close lol`\Ricky is a special player.

As a Wolves fan, when he's running this offense, he gives me hope for this terrible franchise. `\Curry missing wide open 3s LMAO`\lucky I didn't say he'd done it on his own, then - but the question is, was it Mitchell that caused that growth, or would anyone in Mitchell's place have done it - or was it another of the coaching OR training staff, or was it some of the vets on the team?  That's what's "idiotic" to me, attributing it to the HC`\#Exposed.`\literally throw everything i know about basketball out the window`\wouldnt he have made more threes tho?`\ savage as always!!!! `\Big Mac with the tip in!`\smitch throws a fit every time the warriors score`\ha`\Hella hella, Spanish Novela `\I saw him fail to successfully post up all three of Curry, Rush, and LB`\Luke Walton inside job spiked the Gatorade.`\Liking Klay right now`\Check secondary broadcasters. Who is your ABC station, maybe I might be able to help you out?`\He did already. Minor surgery to clean out his knee. Happened a few weeks ago. Been rehabbing since. `\that d by rubio on steph and klay was impressive`\BULL SHIT!`\LaMarcus was fucking money. he looks to be a Warriors killer`\Im hyped for the next spurs vs warriors game.`\http://nbafull.com/`\As a Warriors fan I've got to hand it to the Spurs. They clamped down and made Steph look like a regular mortal having a poor game....which has been done before. But they also shut down the rest of the team and kept the pace at their tempo, which is pretty damn rare to see this year.
Also, glad to see the Warriors keep it close despite all their issues on offense.  It's going to be a fun ass matchup in the playoffs.  Part of me can't wait...the other part is desperately praying that San Antonio gets bounced in the first round

Curry dribbled off of Aldridges foot. `\Good observation. Refs don't give Kawhi the calls other stars get. `\good defense barnes though`\Refs were shit the whole game. I'd never seen Kerr and Pop so visually outraged. At the end of the game I could lip read their conversations and they were laughing at how poorly the game was called. The officials called nothing when bodies were flying everywhere, but would blow a whistle when there was no contact whatsoever.`\Well I mean its always easy to say that in our position to pass it out to someone but at the same time if you're in his position, you have to make a split second decision while under pressure.`\You can. I still fucking hate the Warriors, Curry's stupid fucking pubic chin hair, Klay's face, Draymond's mouthbreathing ass, and Andre Iguodala's bitchface. I just respect that this team is absolutely fucking OP and there's really no way to stop it. So fuck you and your stupid team that's probably going to end in the history books.`\The smile from Green throwing the ball away down by 14 :))))))`\I don't think it'll work regardless of the score, I think the league overall has seen Sam Mitchell underperform at the helm of the Timberwolves with how many talented young players they have.

Operators are standing by.`\Both teams played scrappy D. For the most part, I think this is how a series between the two will be. Either GSW blows SAS defense out of the water or SAS holds firm, and it'll prolly switch between games. `\Where the fuck is u/Sane333 and what did u/GenButtNekkid do to him?`\I don't know if I'd have thought so at the beginning of the season though. Even when Bled and TJ were healthy, we were still playing pretty poorly. At least now we know Booker is far and away this team's future and Len is turning out to be the player we've always wanted him to be.`\i live on the west coast and i agree, its so late! must be hell for east coasters`\SHOWTIME.`\Someone on the Warriors needs to step up. `\Legendary. `\Ball don't lie`\I mean, they're down two centers...`\Fucking flopper`\Only in fm12`\Well no, that's why I at least added the New Years caveat, but our defense has been championship caliber, without an offense to go with it :(`\Ironically that record will be the one that breaks that record.`\Oh damn, the Heat are pooping on the Cavs.`\Just gotta be bold and go with it aka say fuck it and hope for the best`\Really missing Bogut in this game.`\Role players are playing/shooting well.

I take that !!!`\When both teams aren't playing to the fans' expectations, the refs are the first scapegoat`\amen`\Not necessarily, but the odds were mightily decreased with SA's defensive scheme. Curry probably would have made maybe 2 more 3's that were open. If I recall correctly (I watched the game like 2 hours ago on demand) he had only 2 open threes and the others were so well defended he rather forced the shots, even for Curry's shooting skill. The one Curry hit against Alrdrige on the angle was a very tough one, within Curry's skill but he didn't hit any more. SA defended smartly and they played the odds, since they deliberately lowered them. Aldridge is also a pretty decent defender at the 3pt line and quite tall with his wing span. I am guessing Curry would hit more 3's another time but who is to say or compare that to this time. Averages are a result of the situations created and can but should not only be used to PREdict an outcome, since the situation has to be taken into account. How many games has Curry played against such a defense as today this season? The outcome showed what worked well. And I agree it was a back to back and what not (I saw what a btb does to a player and his shooting with Lillard and the Blazers' btb games and his shots) but the Spurs really played super D on Steph and they knew what they were doing. I am also guessing that Pop is going to learn from this experience and ADD to his defensive scheme for next time. So for us the fun is that we will see what WILL pan out next time. None of our perceptions and opinions will matter when it is layed out live on the court and the outcome shown. =)`\> My "diehard" Laker fan dad: Who is this kid doing the chicken dance???

Haha wow dude that was fucking hilarious! I don't think I've ever seen someone call NBA referees, or referees in sports for that matter, garbage!

That was a really creative joke you made man. Take my upvote.`\Yeah but the reality is that in a playoff series the tempo is always going to tend towards being much slower and more grind-it-out. I think the first matchup was more of an outlier and that tonight was more indicative of how a series would play out between these two teams. It's going to a grind-it-out chess match that can go either way. `\Fun times in Cleveland againnnnn`\I'm partial to even the weirder stuff of his.

It's a masterpiece.`\Yes, but Lillard Lowry Wall he gave up huge games to all of them. He's not a good defender at all which is why Klay usually guards the PG if the SG isn't good enough. Dame is good yeah but so is Curry. And great offense always beats great defense the best defenders give up points..

Just because they get lit up one game or games by Curry doesn't mean their bad if they defend well every other night. Curry on the other hand has been getting wrecked by a number of PGs. He makes up for it with his offense though.

and you talk about the "randoms" hitting shots... well now those "randoms" WILL have confidence the next time they meet up if it's a first round series/ if GSW had dusted them when they were up 18 in the 3rd, Villanueva would be 0-fer and probably thinking "man i stunk it up"... instead he's probably walking around right now with the George Jefferson strut talking about "y'all know Draymond fouled me too..." and don't for a second think that a top-five coach like Carlisle didn't take note of Villanueva's explosion. still remember how he pulled rookie Tayshaun Prince out of nowhere to shut down T-Mac after the Magic had gone up 3-1 in that early 2000s series... and inserting Barea in the starting lineup in the Finals versus the Heat... dude is a mad scientist... i think i'll rather roll with a JB Bickerstaff-coached team than a Carlisle-coached one LOL`\Indeed, he does. ����`\Guys time to overreact! `\yea spurs stream does that`\Love the way the Wolves are battling for rebounds this game`\It's ESPN, what did you expect?`\Spurs fantastic defense put the clamps on golden states 3 ball`\holy shit, this is really happening`\Feels good man.`\Hahahahahaha`\swaggy p is that annoying kid at recess that was ass at ball but somehow always hit the game-winning dagger right before the bell `\We could still lose this game.

But he kept denying the tickets 4 times before accepting tickets to a playoff game 7 vs Rockets.  He and his Dad went and thought the tickets were just for Club 200 bar seats where they would watch the entire game on a flat screen TV instead of the actual game inside the stadium.  In reality, the tickets were SRO (standing room only) and they could have indeed watched the actual game, albeit standing.  Frustrated with this "poor treatment" he decided to make a reddit post (which hit 5k upvotes before mods removed it for "inciting a witch hunt") describing how he was mistreated and ignored, in an attempt to publicly shame Draymond into compensating him with more freebies, presumably for 2016 playoff tickets since he waited a year before speaking up.  He mentioned that he was blocked by Draymond on Twitter, but failed to say that it was because he trolled Draymond in a tweet when Michigan (Draymond's alma mater) lost.  Also, he tried to contact Draymond's mom about all of this, too.  He apparently has deleted his account.`\warriors shooting 3-25 from the three point line
