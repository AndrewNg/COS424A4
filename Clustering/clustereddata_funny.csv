He might be the most likable character on the show but he's far from the best. Walt's character tells a tale of a classic tragedy and despite all his best efforts he alienates everyone and realizes the money wasn't worth sacrificing the love he had. Jesse's character starts out so abrasive, idiotic, and annoying. You wonder why Walt keeps him around as he continues to fail over and over. But eventually we see he is just as capable as his mentor. Walt kept him around because he believed in him and because he was unbelievably loyal. Unfortunately Walt abuses this loyalty and manipulates Jesse multiple times, leading to his capture. We see Jesse stand up for himself in the last episode and essentially tell Walt that he was responsible for everything. Walt losing Jesse's loyalty is the actual climax of the show and it's absolutely brilliant. I don't even want to start on Hank or Skylar.",http://reddit.com/r/funny/comments/4a0mbq/c/d0wru02,4705,5

We boarded up and came back with new storefront a few days later.

I could walk fine without them but I wasn't supposed to bare weight on my leg. Well, we went to Disneyland about three years after my surgery. Because of all the walking I didn't want to use my crutches so my family got me a wheel chair. We got to skip all the lines and when we would get up to the ride I would act out exactly what is shown in this picture and get up out of my wheel chair, seemingly healed, and walk to the ride and get in.

I see a similar sign at the supermarket with the tear off number and the name Megan on it, so I take one as I don't have the time to do it myself. Well I call and ask for Megan and am greeted with an angry concerned voice asking who I was and what I wanted with their daughter. Confused, I tell them that I need my yard cleaned and I saw her advertising. When Megan got on the phone I realized their tone was because she was 9 years old! After her and her father were finished I gave them an extra $10 because it was a lot of work for $20.
