All of this feedback is taken in, and talked about.Over the past few months, we have been getting a lot of feedback about the quality of the subreddit. Some people are not happy with the quality of the content on the subreddit, some people don't like the quality of the comments, etc, etc Solving this issue is no simple task. We brainstormed, came up with ideas, and voted on them. Nothing would really pass, something would come up, or another idea would just not be possible on the reddit platform.So we reached backWhat have other subreddits done to increase quality?Some tighten up on rulesSome create a poster whitelistMost became selfpost onlyAt that last point, when we finally came up with the idea it was clear then. The best way to increase the quality of /r/pics was to make it self-post only.Starting right now, /r/pics will only allow self posts. We are doing this to help stop and even reverse the decline of the sub. In addition, self promotion and spam has been a big problem lately. We have been absolutely flooded by run of the mill spam, as well as karma farmers - new accounts that steal comments and pictures in order to gain karma and sell their accounts. This kind of spam is incredibly hard to deal with. We decided along with self post only, we would just ban all links entirely.Thank you./r/pics mods",22,https://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/4cskn3,/r/pics is now text-only,"

9090,pics,"In the past we've discouraged links to unfamiliar image hosts because we tend to crash their servers or bankrupt them with bandwidth fees whenever they hit the front page and get hit with front-page traffic. In a few egregious cases, we've also encountered a bit of excessive self-promotion.This had led to shutting-out many professional photographers and artists who would like to submit their work to /r/pics while hosting the images on their own sites, rather than just imgur, 500px, flickr or deviantart.Most of the hosting issues seem to have been worked out over the last few years: many good hosts now have affordable plans that can take a 5K-karma post without handing you a bill for half your life savings. So for the past few months, we've been unofficially relaxing those restrictions a little to see how it goes, and we'd now like to open this up officially. These are our guidelines for professional photographers and artists who would like to host submissions from their own sites. We're also offering ""Verified Photographer"" and ""Verified Artist"" flair to users who can prove to us (privately via modmail) that it's their site. Verified status means that other redditors on /r/pics can see that your posts are OC (Original Content) unless you specify otherwise in the post title. ""Verified"" flair will be a condition for linking to your own site, from now-on.All of reddit's self-promotion rules still apply, of course, which means this isn't a license to spam /r/pics or pass off other people's content as your own.Our subscribers come here to see all kinds of pics--the unusual, the hilarious, and the inspiring--but we know they're hungry for quality above all, and we'd love to see you bring it.",24,https://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/4a40jr,Professional photographers and artists: We now offer 'Verified' flair and guidelines for linking to your own site,Next add a tag for when the original photographer or artist is participating in the comment section.,http://reddit.com/r/pics/comments/4a40jr/c/d0x68y1,434,1
