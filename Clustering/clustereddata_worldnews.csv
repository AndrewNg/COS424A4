Honestly I try to be objective, but I think that a lot of the problem with this situation is people have the narratives all backwards. They say Israel is a theocracy based on reclaiming holy land because the bible tells them to. While the Palestinians are viewed as secular freedom fighters just trying to liberate their land that was stolen by religious tyrants. The truth is very complex but by and large most Israelis are very secular and a majority of Palestinians are much more religiously observant. Also the biggest objection to Israel especially in this most recent wave of stabbing has far less to do with the occupation and was actually instigated on because of a rumor that Israel was trying to take over al Aqsa mosque. Which was a baseless rumor by the way. The Palestinians rioted because Jews tried to pray at the Temple Mount which was built on top of the ancient Jewish temple. Jews are forbidden from visiting the mount. In fact only Muslims are allowed to visit. Much like Mecca it is only open to Muslims. Yet any Jewish holy site is open to any faith and throughout Israel freedom of religion is practiced the same as any other country. The Israelis are a tough prickly people, but deep down they are by and large good and Israel provides a lot humanitarian support, even to their sworn enemies. Are they perfect? Of course not. They have their issues like any country, but if you honestly look at them objectively you'd see they do more good for the world than harm. And when you realize the depravity of their enemies and the lengths they will go through to kill even one Israeli it starts to inform you a bit more of why they are the way they are. It's a very complicated issue and I do want to see an independent Palestine, but peace has to come from both sides and until both sides can overcome their hatred and start looking to the future Israel will continue to maintain the status quo.

About 200 have never been read. X-raying begins in July."," where these scrolls were recovered beginning in the middle-1700's is theorized to have belonged to Lucius Calpurnius Piso Caesoninus, father-in-law of Julius Caesar, wealthy art collector, man of culture and a patron and friend of the Epicurean philosopher Philodemus. As such, his library (the only complete private library from antiquity so-far discovered) would have been a substantial one, and of note even at the time. Based on scrolls from this collection which were already successfully or semi-successfully unrolled we know that the library contained a large number of Greek philosophical texts. Many years ago my classics professor told us that only about 1%, maybe less, of all the literature produced in classical antiquity has survived. I don't know if that number is absolutely correct, but I think the basic sentiment certainly is... much has been lost from this era.
