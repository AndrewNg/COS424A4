`\I think so. Do us a solid and let us have the next one :D`\Quickly glancing at their owed salaries for next season, it looks as if the Hornets will be able to retain their key players while also still having about enough to offer a max contract to someone else.

That 1 was the buzzer beater loss to the Wizards.

When Danny is on we're nearly unbeatable. `\What? Kanter is a very dependable scorer, and Ibaka is USUALLY good for a sort of efficient 12ppg. The problem is that Donovan doesn't play Kanter enough and he has terrible terrible rotations. Morrow has disappeared from our lineup and his shooting is so cold now he's useless. He fucking ruined a great role player that was amazing for us last season. Fuck I hate this dude.

Tonight, he didn't call a timeout in a 7 minute stretch where the Spurs went on a huge run in the 4th and he didn't put Kanter back in to close when KD and Westbrook were being shut down with double teams and couldn't pass to anyone. (Kanter was doing really well too) He has repeatedly made the same mistakes and has not learned from them. He is the entire reason this team is in the shape that it's in. He's not utilizing what we have and everyone is showing serious frustration.


`\I'll take misses over stupid pump fakes any day of the week`\I hope Parker is ok :(`\No choking tonight!`\In Kawhi we trust.
`\LMAO`\Good guy Timmy`\Well to be fair, these 2 assistant coaches both have head coaching experience and I'd wager they were drawing many of the plays earlier in the season, since OKC wasn't as prone to choking when they were around. Turnovers have always been a problem for OKC, but only recently have I seen that they can't play past them. But after the ASG, 4th quarter turnovers are both expected and destructive, melting away the leads they build up. Also their bench production is a nail in the coffin, with everyone but Kanter playing like steaming piles of shit. Donovan has a lot of questionable rotations. I feel like Morrow should be used over Roberson esp. when we need offensive production, and I have no idea why Payne isn't getting any minutes.

Worth noting that Serge hasn't been great lately. Stevens is coming along fine, but his hands are bricks or something because he's a big source of turnovers with his inability to catch sometimes. Roberson is an offensive black hole that lets opposing teams double down on one of Durant/Westbrook.

It's a team that's always had problems, but these problems are becoming way more apparent with the loss of its two assistants. Donovan's inexperienced and from what I've seen, he's pretty terrible during crunch time and has some questionable lineups. . For instance, yesterday Ibaka was playing like shit and Kanter would have been great on the floor in the last minutes. But Kanter was on the bench while Ibaka played like shit. He also can't reign in Durant and Westbrook well, and they make stupid decisions and stupider turnovers as a result. `\he's finally knocking down that midrange jumper after a kawhi or tony pick and pop.  Plus teammates are trusting him now to hit that consistently`\Yeah. And to think Bird's Celtics went 40-1.

Also, they're humble...they go out of their way to not create bulletin board material, and I like that.  It's like competing against gravity.

p.s. Stray, weird thought...Pop assembles his roster like he's playing Scrabble (or Gwent for Witcher fans). "I only want to play him, and him, and him,  We won't need anyone else.

This is working though `\Death, Taxes. Losing to the Pels`\contusion is probably medical term/used before bruise became a word? idfk`\Every fanbase has cocky douchebags to be fair. Just remember that the few dont represent the many in this case `\Chris Paul???`\Big mans rebound for Jordan!`\Was watching till HT. What happened in that third??`\ No :(`\No matter how it ends up, as long as the top 4 teams in the West win the first round it's going to be really fun and interesting.`\"Michael Jordan wasn't much of a scorer." - Pacers announcers`\-God`\Spurs fans acting like their losing because of the refs, yet they can't make an open shot and are shooting 16% from 3. `\What a disappointment of an ending.  25 or bust, dammit. /s`\Parker has been really bad against great centers guarding the paint. Pop should switch up depending on the opp.`\Gotta try and get that 1 seed. Gonna be hard as fuck to beat Golden State in a 7 game series playing 4 games in San Fran. Golden State is probably thinking the same thing about beating the Spurs with 4 games in San Antonio lol. As amazing as Golden State's record is, the Spurs could legitimately still get the 1 seed.`\Oh, I was talking about the Simmons contact, in which case the Manu thing wouldn't matter since Lance had already committed an Offensive Foul. And people were saying the "no call" was the reason we gained the momentum, which I assumed was because they wanted a blocking foul called on Simmons.`\Jobs are good, Texas has had one of the best economies out of the states. Generally people are more laid back then most places I've been, especially when it comes to driving. Night life is good, you're gonna have clubs and a ton of bars and shit in every big town, but I really don't know much because that's not really my thing. If you don't like it, Austin is 45 min away.`\*6th seed

lol, we struck a nerve. Someone's a bit anally anguished.`\Great interview`\At least it's against the Grizzlies (no offense Memphis) at home? Could be worse`\Spurs left them in the dust in the 4th. Main thing I took away though, JJ is not that good`\Kawhi for President!`\Parker is a much better defender than Patty. `\Watching UT lose to NIU was bad enough, but watching NIU squander that lead against A&M was even worse. If we lose this game, after the first quarter we had, I may have to quit sports.`\Go back to sleep!! It's our only hope `\I wanna sleep with Aldridge :(`\Didn't guard him**`\We lost because Johnathon Simmons, Matt Bonner, and Andre didn't play. Also refs where against us and Kawhi never shoots this bad.  Lol

 GG hornets you guys played awesome you deserved it.`\Duck Bay Gallon!`\I LOVE YOU KAWHI!`\Yeh but sinnce its a meme, it gets so overused it loses any sense of comedy within a week.`\I don't think anyone has said that. `\Alvin what the fuck`\lol well then`\damn, spurs on fire offensively and defensively. `\Yes, keep hacking Ian`\No rim protection this game it seems.`\2000 era Nuggets.`\FFS FEED THE POST`\I think I heard the stat that he's something like 22 pts + in the last 10-12 games against the Spurs. `\The league would just quite at that point.`\How would betting on the Spurs straight win yield a lot? No way that was more than 1.5X`\and we only lost by 8 points... `\31 points on 16 FGA. LMA is becoming pretty damn efficient now.`\Monta is the man`\brings a smile to my face`\lel Kyle not the best dude to run a fast break at the end of the q`\Yeah, the number is actually larger, if you can believe it. I just didn't feel like looking up the records haha. `\Wtf man.`\Gordon is a bum, injuries didn't just kill him it was lack of drive. He never put the work in to develop his skill. He just got paid and stopped caring. `\Our missing pieces now are Manu (probably gotta shake some rust off) and Green. We need those two to really hit it by playoffs.`\Do putback's like Adams before count as rebounds as well? `\What about the first game back from the ASG vs. the Clips, I'd say our performance tonight rivaled that.`\Danny green sighting just as rare as spotting a great white shark`\Thanks! I've always hated the Spurs with the intensity of a thousand suns. But I guess I hate them less than Draymond or LeBron. Or the Clippers.`\And two ABA teams at that.   I've wanted a Pacers / Spurs Finals for so long.  Something always happens when it's most likely to happen.  `\:D It's 11am here, perfect time to watch basketball and binge on chocolate`\We should get Nazr in against all these old players`\Most Charlotte fans don't get it either. There seems to be this feud between the new hornets fans that came along with Lin, and some other hornets fans.

The general consensus is that were glad we have him. But the vocal people...are pretty vocal about him.`\3 travel calls so far already`\Normally Kanter produces but David West is giving him issues.

Everyone else is either trash or streaky as fuck. `\Lol no. Defense? I still say no and all around that's not even close `\Does Ginobli get old? wtf I feel he's been in the league forever and always has looked the same `\they only need 4 more outstanding losses`\ugh these french spurs players low key trying to recruit Batum`\spurs line up age.

Plus minus of Lac's 5 bench players who have played but of course Doc leaves them all in at once to start the 4th. SMH `\I like this Danny Green`\We should play on the same team. Game would stay scoreless for at-least an hour.`\Nah nigga FUCK the poolice`\I'm not mad at Cole. What is this feeling? Happiness?  `\Fair.`\Somebody needs to yell at Danny Green for Pop.`\getting ugly!!!!!`\lol that foul.`\Does anyone have that Kawhi behind the back bounce pass to Aldridge?`\Gonna crowdsource about $100k for the tickets?`\danny is the reason for this shit `\Is there a story behind why Cole Aldrich is missing some front teeth`\If he keeps improving every year like he so noticeably has. He will be even more of a monster in a few years. And I love the fact that he seems to know this and is willing to keep working hard to get there.`\Techn9ne out here balling `\GR3333333N`\What happened to Kawhi?!`\4th quarter comeback in the works`\KAWHI FOR MVP FIGHT ME`\http://hehestreams.xyz/`\Wait til your down 15 	at least `\Fuck, I know its on a back to back but it looks like we've completely given up.`\solid game by your team. had me nervous up until the last minute. gg Chicago.`\People are going to shit on OKC, but if you look at the teams they've lost to recently you see GSW x2, SAS, and the Clippers. Those aren't bad teams. `\I miss the times when you did that to us in the conference finals. :'( `\I love finally getting to root for the underdog.`\What a fucking comeback holy shit`\Danny said fuck being cold`\had an Egg earlier, then my mum thought the egg box she bought for next door was too small do I got that one as well. Pigged out on some muffins too, so pretty unhealthy day.


 Slightly slower on the upload tonight because I don't have my second monitor at home, but at least I get to watch`\Thank god idk who told him that was a good idea.`\That shot by Kawhi was lowkey ridiculous.`\Not a back to back.`\sarcasm went through yo head fam`\Why don't we trade KAT. Too many wins he might get us.`\#\#5 whatasized`\Damn, if Kawhi can pick up Manu's runner across the lane...`\Why would the Wolves run something that works?`\Fuck this gay earth`\When the Spurs want to win, it just takes few minutes and last thing you know they are ahead by 8 after being down by 5+.`\It is extremely doubtful that this novel could be characterized as a classic.

Am I being trolled here? Getting whiffs of trollery.`\This.  So many soccer mom fans of this team, the most in-depth analysis you usually here is, "the boys just don't look good tonight" or "Pop gonna be mad at them after that one!"  I yearn to talk serious hoops with fellow Spurs fans!`\Boban needs to start asserting his authoritah in the paint, his fade away one-handed jumpshots just aren't falling tonight.`\Kawhi might hit 30 points :)`\My theory is that as Green's defense improves, his offense will continue to suffer. I think he just doesn't have the legs to intense D and maintain the shooting he's had in the past.`\Refs like her embody what's wrong with the NBA. `\people pray to god that he'll retire quickly `\really? I had just watched the game via the stream, dang`\GO BULLS! `\Alright, alright, alright. LET'S WATCH SOME SHOOTY-HOOPS! `\PATRICK MILLS`\It will never happen again.`\Im still at awe that we have fucking lamarcus aldridge carrying the load for us now aside from Kawhi. He was definitely missing last year when we couldnt close out games `\He can sometimes make some dumb ISO mistakes in crucial moments`\Aldridge heating up`\This game has a strange pace `\#THERETURN`\Kawhi made a bad defensive play, end of story.`\we have a Chip Engelland`\Nazr's known as a good locker room guy and we've had him on the squad before and the guys like him. His desired impact when we signed him was never supposed to be on the floor.`\the ending was equally awkward. sager just turned back to the camera and kawhi ran away haha`\ahh there's the classic westbrook tomahawk, these are standard now`\Kawhi $$$$$`\Patty seems off tonight`\best player to never score 40?`\Martin wtf. Pop needs to grill that mofo.`\GG, bruh.`\If that's what happened, always tune in to Spurs games!`\Like butter god damn that was a pretty shot`\I never understood why the Wolves haven't traded Muhammad I feel like he's just a worse version of Wiggins. `\Nah I've just got a sugar high and posting shit on whatever's on the screen`\Holy shit, the Grizz has Vince Carter too? `\If Danny Green shoots one more 3 point I'm going to kick him in the mouth. `\Clippers get the "we had a racist owner!" card. `\I was following the Grizz vs Cavs game. What happened here?`\Not to mention the fast paced style of play `\Pop is trying out new tactics i see`\You cant kill death itself `\In the Blazers/Raptors game with Lauren Holtkamp there was 65 foul calls, hows it going this game?`\blake's release looks like that of a little kid playing YMCA ball`\Green is terrible to boot.`\How is this game so close?`\Spurs defense ain't that great either so far`\That was only the 3rd holy shit guys`\He's hesitating`\ET playing great tonight`\If anything that should have been on Duncan. Stuck his leg out on the drive.`\Kawhis move there
`\That was a sexy, sexy move by D Wade to close out the half there`\Solo has looked great these past few games.`\What's the origin of that?`\I just want Lance to do well so bad`\Its true. ;\`\I am sure I’m not the first to say this, but the Thunder are SUCH a top-heavy team that Westbrook and Durant can never have bad games. Their bench is effectively useless, they run through so many guys who can’t shoot it’s really incredible. They can’t play Kanter without another big, but playing Kanter and another big locks the paint up for Westbrook to drive.

I think their best team will have the same starting lineup, but put Kanter in and pull Westrbrook at the same time. Why play Randy Foye when he can’t hit a freaking jump shot? Why play Kyle Singler when he can’t hit a freaking jump shot? I know Anthony Morrow is no great shakes on defense, but Singler isn’t exactly Scottie Pippin.

Am I missing something on Cameron Payne? Is he hurt, or not as good as the few times I’ve seen him? I see no reason why Randy Foye should be getting minutes over Payne at this point.
`\He really has not been good in the last month or two`\Their play-by-play guy and analyst. I missed the names of who was calling the game, but they don't bring the same energy as FSD's casters, George Blaha and Gregory "Special K" Kelser.

Seeing as how the 'Stones haven't been getting any national broadcasts, I figured I'd check out ESPN's coverage of the game to see what they have to say.`\That's a Rockets fan you just replied to`\I love watching Kawhi`\Jesus.`\Hey and 2 of the Spurs last 5 games are against the Warriors! how weird is that?`\An 8 seed with 51 wins?  Interesting scenario.`\Just yesterday morning people were saying the "Spurs need an elite PG"`\Is Jeff Green gonna be on LMA? If so, let's just call this a Spurs win now`\Kawhi wants to also be the best individually though, he wants to win an MVP. If he just increased his shots 4-5, his offensive numbers would be more comparable to Westbrook/Durant.`\AND ONE`\I say when Blake comes back we manage their minutes like they do in OKC, always have one on the floor.`\Stop time traveling u fuc
`\It was turned over so much its right side up again.`\Lol, might as well try to break the record for longest basketball game.`\Dragic is averaging 18/8/5 on 55% TS since the all star break (17 games), which would have been absolutely insane coming from chalmers.  Just a bad night for him.`\Kawhi isn't the kind of player that cares about his personal stats. He just wants to win. Respect.`\Probably. He's Matt fucking Bonner. Whether it's eating sandwiches or flipping off refs, he does what he wants.`\That was some solid fucking offense there boys`\http://i.imgur.com/s28PsRv.gif`\They didn't tank because we were injured. They tanked because they knew Z-Bo and Gasol could kill Timmy (who looked old all season), McDyess and Bonner... and THEN Manu broke his arm in the meaningless final game.

Never forgive. Never forget.`\It should've opened the eyes of the spurs front office. Going back to last season and last season's playoffs versus the clippers showed how much Parker has declined. They really need a contingency plan to replace Parker or have him play as the 6th man when Manu retires. He loses games like this for the spurs because of his inability to run the offense or play decent defense. He is a huge minus especially in late game situations. Pop did the right thing against the Pelicans in the last game when he benched Parker late in the 4th for Mills. Too bad he didn't leave this game earlier. I bet they would've had a better chance to win.`\Did you see how fast Patty ran to try and help Tim? Maaan love Patty Stacks!`\Haha I thought it was Rick too. Harden's turning into him while Drake is turning into DJ Khaled`\WHERE THE FUCK IS ERNIE???`\Oh god everyone is getting banged up. Bring in the garbage time players`\B A R S`\Manu with the and1 mixtape move `\You wondered into the wrong thread apparently `\Meh, let's be reasonable here. I'll settle with Steph and Iguodala`\> over commits and gets burned

Exactly this. He's had his ankles broken a few times this year, but the hustle from him is great.`\The camera happened to be focused on the bench when Duncan briefly flashed those triple OG gang signs`\If we lost by 11 after dominating for the first half, I would have considered it a blow out.`\Oh okay.`\Timberwolves should be the ones imagining they had Curry.  `\I know, right?

He's not taking bad shots, he's playing D lights out. What more can you ask of the guy?`\Yeah, you're right, Pop doesn't know what he's doing playing that scrub. Fire Pop and cut Tony.



Obviously I'm being sarcastic. Tony runs the offense how Pop wants him to, or we would see him bitching out Tony on the sidelines. Considering this doesn't happen, it's safe to say Tony isn't playing as poorly as you think he is.`\They know the end already since they wrote it  /s`\So how long until Kevin Martin plays? Does he have to learn the system first or what?`\These Spurs could beat the Warriors if they show up. In the 4th They had the offense that beat the heat, and have the defense of the Bruce Bowen teams`\At this point if the dpoy race is between kawhi or timmy, I don't even know who I'd cheer for. Kawhi getting back to back dpoy's would be amazing to start off his career, but timmy getting one for his final (maybe) year would be remarkable `\Apparently got hurt (saw from another comment)`\Agreed. I'm starting to hate the Spurs after spending time in this subreddit. Massive circlejerk around that whole team`\lmao we tried so hard to be the spurs on that possession.`\Give him some slack. He's french.`\that just happened`\travel and out of bounds`\i hope manu doesnt kill us.`\Idk About the Rockets, but HEB does have a bunch of commercials in Houston with JJ Watt and his mom. `\there it is`\He's dribbling the air out of the basketball only to turn it over or take a contested shot`\This has been a fun game so far`\LMAOOOOOO`\Damn, the dreaded KCP offensive struggle `\Get Danny Green out. Jesus christ`\Pop is a huge troll.

Just yesterday some people were saying kawhi could never be the top player in the league cause his career high is only 32.

This game makes that look like a joke.`\the fuck happened to us after all star week`\Tell me about it. Very streaky :(`\Kawhi needs to hit some 3s tonight, Redick had a great night last night`\God damn LaMarcus is good.`\Does this mean we are the best team in the NBA now?`\I feel like it would be best for everybody if Kyle Anderson shaved his head.`\I wonder if we get a Gentry tirade tonight. Dude is about to up and quit, I swear`\KEEP THEM TO 7 POINTS THIS QUARTER!!`\Lawson injury updated to a left FOOT sprain, will not return :(`\Mills has really been clicking with those two, I love it.`\Stop winning already. Jeez`\Thunder are coming back with Westbrook putting up like 6 straight points. This game is starting to make more sense now.`\IMO the Spurs are the epitome of how to run an organization. I have nothing but respect (and fear) for them.`\But they've beat every team convincingly in the last couple regular seasons `\This is how you utilize two superstars correctly. Take note OKC.`\*Somebody* hates his guts.  `\Liking our hustle on defense so far.`\Making this .4 will almost kinda make up for .4. But who the fuck thinks we're about to make a 3? lol`\ONYA MATTY PILLS`\You were pretty fun to watch too`\Boban shooting free throws looks like a normal sized person playing those basketball arcade machines`\THATS A PROBABILITY. ILL CHECK INTO IT`\really!?? there were SIX hands on Duncan!! no call?!!`\That was literally the definition of all ball`\reggie miller `\WEST IS A FUCKING G!!!!`\Tim Duncan, LaMarcus Aldridge, David West, and Boris Diaw are on his team.`\I wish ABA teams had special retro jerseys every time they played each other.`\It's cool the op is a spurs fan so its rightful that he posts the post game thread. `\Call me when you're not in the Finals`\Danny Green should climb into that blue trash can where he belongs `\oh shit Pop is gonna chew everyone out`\I suppose that looked bad out of context. I was more lamenting how Patty has been cold all night, I would've preferred him at least draw rim but I guess it was a Hail Mary regardless.`\Omg Danny.
`\DEM CHANTS THO`\Yeah OKC Hornets`\at first I thought westbrook was going for a reverse dunk but fuck me that'll do`\We need KCP to get going`\Mine was down`\Okay, I'm in love with Andre. He's showing some real hustle out there.`\your face is a typo!`\Wow - kawhi `\Why Drummond onky play 3 mins?`\Fat Lady`\Great company for the Spurs.`\Oh my fucking god man. It doesn't matter who gets the wide open look or who creates the wide open look. The problem is the ball going in the hoop. `\So many assists. Thought He would have hit his career high, but we got the W.`\Really liking Aldridge's court vision.  He's looking for and making Spurs-like passes.`\And had less turnovers than John Wall last night`\He was dreadful against GSW as well. I'm getting slightly nervous about how he performs against top teams. Hopefully now he is a bit more comfortable but we will see in these next few weeks.`\yo wtf happened here`\Danny Green had so many chances down the stretch`\If your team is down 26, there are other problems besides the refs.`\How did all the grizzlies turn into all stars for this game.

Matt Barnes and bird man have personal problems with the spurs`\Four out of our five starters tonight are in the double digits. The fifth starter has zero points. Guess who it is?`\My wife was saying that. Not sure what to think.`\Starting to resemble Kid Cudi's career post MOTMII, aka our Finals appearance.`\Castle you lucky man. `\A bit.`\Spurs held CP3, Westbrook, and Steph to 0 points in the 4th quarter in their matchups, but allow Jeremy Lin to score 15 in the 4th lol`\I've been keeping my eye on Bullock when hes out there and I'm pleasantly surprised with his Defense so far.`\spurs, pls.`\WOW!`\Nah. He sounds like a horse `\Yeah Tony basically jumped him when he went up. Bad call `\BOBAN GON GIVE IT TO YA!`\Apparently he was talking shit and edited his statements lol`\You mean Kawhi on Westbrook.`\IDK Boris gave us a good push there in the beginning to keep it close.`\when is BG coming back?`\Ha I see what you did there!`\It's a play on Enes Kanter.  He was trying to be funny.`\Water is wet `\lollll`\Go Spurs Go`\God, our shooting is atrocious.`\What a choke job by the spurs.`\Nice passing boys.`\Point spread?`\u r welcome`\I'll admit I have to agree with your first two, but I'm unsure about Lebron/Kyrie...`\Does Gentry even have a system on this clutch situations? Like a hammer play or a high low for an easy 2 for Davis? `\K-WHI LENNY`\It's only fun every once in a while.  Then it becomes unbearable.  I watched far too many terrible Astros games while they were tanking.  It's hard to watch. `\Pick it up guys`\Yeah`\So this is what Linsanity feels like.`\Dear whoever is in charge of the cameras: Watching it from the other end of the court makes it difficult to figure out what's going on and judge distances. Don't make us watch it like that, there's a reason those are the cheap seats in sports stadiums.`\too exciting...gah`\Spurs are shooting like this is a 2k game. `\Take that as a sign of respect, they know full well that your bench is no joke`\FUCK, quad contusion. D:`\I'd watch that for at least 2 and a half minutes.`\You've disappointed me senpai`\Patty's level of hustle is off the goddamn charts, that's absurd.`\lol that wasn't intentional `\Kevin harlan is great`\Alright kawhi has to be a robot for sure. That mid range shot is money every time`\Every person in this thread`\Dude was just terrible everywhere. He kept dribbling into traffic and turning the ball over`\This is hilarious `\He's not your fwiend, budday. `\AD is a hard matchup`\TIMMMMMMMYYYY`\Exhibit A: Christmas Day

*shudders*`\>You used the word 'we.' So, nice try.

Yea... Well... Fuck you!

lol I legit didn't know we had people going into yalls threads and sub. Oops. I hate that. I love shit talking, but it has its time and place. `\Okay then don't complain when Durant leaves.`\Luke Babbitt looks like a guy in my rec league.... `\this is the fucking Knicks all over again`\Kawhi with the Rocket League dribble`\It's like a sexual experience every time Kawhi swishes a jumper like that`\https://i.imgur.com/fwgLl1P.png`\LANCE NO.`\i refuse to acknowledge any words that may rhyme with your chosen words.`\*4 point play!*`\Leonard is too fucking good.`\That's actually the only thing I would have him do as a clipper. Given that I had to play him.

He's actually not too bad with lay ups. Problem is he often runs into trees and gets fouled, and his FTs are not that consistent. `\Nah

"I have no strong feelings one way or another"`\hurts for us to lose but i'm also waiting for people to stop talking about linsanity like it's something unnatural.`\maybe thats the key. Danny needs to stop taking easy shots`\Absolutely. I've been seeing his highlights all season and I think I'll watch him play tonight over my Knicks`\They were only up by 2

Does that even count`\his internet is dialup`\only the Spurs can make Jermey Rin and Courtney Lee look like perennial all-stars lol...the playoffs can't come soon enough.`\They're doing fine.  Just need to grab some boards.`\That was an ugly win, everytime I thought we pulled it away they came back and closed it to 4. Also LMA totally didn't deserve that all star spot `\Illegal screen `\this is getting out of hand...`\Parker can still put up 25 points and 10 assists in a playoff game if we need it. I think people are selling him short because he's just letting the others get their confidence built for the postseason`\Tell me about it!`\He might have a bruised knee`\HOLY DICK`\you're too damn slow Anderson!`\Agreed.  Clippers always bring out the best in the Spurs, and vice versa.`\Best record through first 60 games in franchise history IIRC`\Like I think he can be a contender for most underpaid player this season based on his production.`\put Mills back in`\You know reffing is bad when Bill and Sean are bitching on behalf of the Grizzlies.`\WHY NOT KYLE ANDERSON`\It's on FSSW? Didn't know that...I'll have to switch over`\Andre Miller already averaging the most offensive rebounds per game on our team.`\I was so confused. At first I thougth it was go pels go, then I realized its actually "go spurs go!" lol. `\you too :D`\"COCKS IT AND ROCKS IT" - HARLAN IS THE GOAT`\Did I get it rights Dubs fans?`\Someone get Putin on the line so we can send these refs to a Gulag`\I'm glad I stuck to three beers tonight. Now I have three more to try to forget this game.

No matter what, we played and shot like shit, especially in the first half. They even gave us a chance at the end, we just couldn't get it together tonight.`\It didn't but I still lol at the facts `\LET'S GO!`\lol, I don't blame him...`\Any idea why I can never get them to work on vlc? I copied the link into the network stream option, then I get an error message. `\dad dickin all over the place`\LIIIIIIN`\So did the Pelicans fans going into halftime.`\Sweet revenge!!

But that blow was pretty ugly. Sorry about that.`\damn I almost bought a ticket for section 118 row 13 to go to this game. I want free bread!`\And Lexi Belle is fat now :(`\You should trade for Ish Smith. I hear he's a point guard. `\Either way out shakes out they're damn sure gonna remember the Alamo.`\Cuck the Flippers `\Kawhi is on fire`\Did Red Rocket flip off the ref? `\So where is the Warriors in terms of this record?`\We would've lost the game without him imo. Parker was trash and we had no go-to guy. Maybe Boban could've turned the tables but we Pop didn't take the chance. `\Don't worry he'll become a cyborg once he runs out of knees just to continue playing`\Flair up. Dont be scared. `\aha timmy, how was there no foul there`\Boban can't guard the pick and roll. Too slow on his feet. CP3 would eat that matchup alive.`\*DEFENSE HURR DURR*`\Welcome to SA where the players play`\Oh I don't doubt that - for me though, I think it's quite a weak excuse since other players who runs the offense like Chris Paul or Rondo still can do it without a high turnover rate. That said, what I meant was I need to watch more Rocket games to see whether those turnovers are inevitable or if Harden is just a bad decision maker/passer.`\Oh, that stopped two straight possessions with zero ball movement and hacking their way to the basket and forcing horribly contested layups?  K, lady ref.  Got it.`\Just Spurs bro... 30 straight playoffs is my goal`\LET'S GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO`\I don't mind Parker not playing well. The whole point of Leonard developing and getting LA is to have better primary scorers. But when Danny Green goes 1-9 from three after that new contract...fuck that. Though his defense is still solid I suppose. `\Forreal, LET US SULK!`\"WE'RE \#1 IN THE POWER RANKINGS. FUCK THIS GOTTA GET BACK UNDER THE RADAR."`\I hope not this year but maybe one day`\SHIT.`\Timmy going in to retirement SWINGING.`\Its not even the 4th Qtr calm down`\No, you won't. You lost to Minnesota. At home. You guys should never drop a game to one of the worst teams in the league. Your team has dropped more 4th quarter leads than the 76ers. Your team will not be fine. `\For anyone who didn't see, Kawhi slammed knees with Stoudemire`\Big if. Say your prayers .... He  gives us a real shot vs the warriors if he gets his shot back.`\Shocking.  Don't fuck with the Ws.  `\I thought he had a stretch of games where his minutes were low, and Lin took on more of a responsibility and managed it nicely. The problem isn't with Kemba not being good enough, but with two ball-dominant PGs being on the same team. Lin doesn't seem to be a great fit here, unless he embraces more of a shooting guard type of role, which isn't his biggest strength.`\I like this. Game isn't even done yet. Good bet tho.`\Tyreke hasn't played sf in a long time, Reggie. `\so sadddd`\He's streaky. It's painful whenever he hits the cold bits, but he'll probably have a firey second half.`\Battier couldnt hit a shot for 2 months till game 7, then he started knocking down everything he put up. Allen saved game 6 and Battier saved game 7. It was AWESOME!`\So was our next run in the playoffs til Westbrook got hurt.`\[Who you gonna call?](https://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/4285569/DJEsdYq.0.jpg)`\DAYUM.  Why you gotta...tell the truth like that :(`\The thing about the Warriors is they have never beaten an elite team in the playoffs`\It's actually cappuccino, sorry just getting it out there.`\Mike I miss you so much`\He should be sponsored by baby oil under the rim.`\I'd rather face Houston in the first round if possible. They're not a strong competitor, Tim has never faced them so they're the only West team he's never beaten in the playoffs, and if they make the playoffs, they'll get a worse draft pick. `\Ibaka!!!!`\I swear to god the Pelicans go ape shit against us every match up. They just love gearing up to play the Spurs`\I really hope the Thunder stay in that 3rd seed. People are saying that OKC has the best shot against the Warriors. But all I see is a team with poor defense, Waiters/Singler in the rotations, and Scotty Donovan as coach. I'd much rather see them in the 2nd round than the Clipps who always play Golden State tough as well.`\It's just whiny Spurs fans who are used to winning. `\:(`\Best handles in the league. The tiny fundamental at it again.`\What's does that even mean?`\*God`\Depends on the matchup. With young athletic bigs out there he's a negative, it's not even an effort thing he just cant move his feet anymore. Against slower guys he's a net positive definitely, but not quite to the degree that his numbers imply.
`\If we fucken lose this one after GS lost yesterday I'm gonna be pissed...`\We've been blowing teams out lately, people want to see a 4th quarter. `\So spurs had finished rebuilding and lakers is still tanking?`\lol he had a 35 point game against the raptors earlier this season`\Again Tony?`\Probably bruised his knee `\Mike smith pls`\Ibaka really dropped the ball. :V`\WE BUZZIN FAM`\Boban not making his shots`\EAT SLEEP BREAK THE STREAK`\Old Man Riverwalk! `\What the fuck happened after that 7 points first Q`\I see why Memphis is still firmly in the playoffs. Geez`\What a tough decision to make. But that tells you how great this team is and how much everybody contributes. Even with our end of the bench guys like McCallum and Bonner, we feel some hesitation with cutting them and bringing in new guys, even if those guys are proven vets.`\The record against those top teams for the Spurs is skewed, i mean most of their games have been on the road vs top teams, theyve won both of them at home`\We're trying to make up games behind Warriors though. We should've won this since they lost to the Lakers. `\love this PA music person`\Thanks!`\Simmon's can't catch a break tonight`\http://ftve3200-i.akamaihd.net/hls/live/217139/room307/4028k/prog.m3u8

The Spurs one is a softball game for some reason.`\#CHOO-CHOO`\The lower the score the better. Can you imagine 1 point?! Damn this better not happen in the finals.`\Save the comment, mi amigo. Let's see where they at in 2 seasons. Blazers are the Future.`\Some terrible possessions by the Spurs.`\I nominate Nawlins for the worst PA announcer in the league. `\me as well`\That is the thing Kawhi has been missing. PLAYMAKING!! When he gets that down he will truley be the best two way player in the league for a long time to come.`\Check the bench scoring`\Thank God this is on tnt. Almost missed this one since I'm stuck at Chili's but I got some angry looks from Mavs homers when I asked them to put this on one of the tvs lol`\The Rotations and rest seriously confounded the team chemistry.  We need to get back to a solid rotation now.  `\mother fucking BOBAANNNN`\I'll take it.`\Huh?`\HOLY SHIT LIN`\What comment?`\yummy`\great to win a game in where Lamarcus, Green, Tim and Tony Parker had the night off.`\:'(`\THIS IS WHY THE SPURS ARE CHOKERS ahahahah and people think they can beat the warriors?`\7 points in the first just to give the Spurs false hope.`\Hey guys kawhi must have gotten fouled on the wide open three right?? why else would he miss???`\Lol Patty `\Geez man`\Nah man, you must not know about Boban "Serbian Hakeem" Marjonovic `\come on clippers don't mess this up`\"Hoiberg is a loose cannon." - Craig Sager`\It's been a weird couple days.`\/r/nbastreams`\I asked a legitimate question you dick, please just get out if you can't take it.`\I am so sorry that your spurs are getting the short stick against my pelicans. It must be so hard being a spurs fan.`\There should be a law, on not calling defensive fouls on KCP. He's the cleanest defender in the league.`\*ball`\Feels like the Spurs are getting outhustled...`\da fuq`\sigh`\I want Popovich to be the President, because it'd be fun to: (a) see Sager in the White House Press Corps; and (b) watch Pop slay every single press conference.`\Stop making contact with Kawhi's knees plz`\-Interesting how Pop put Danny Green on Durant and Kawhi on Westbrook

-Pop was telling Tony to give it to Kawhi at the end of the game, he wants him to get that clutch time experience for the playoffs

-Duncan warming up for playoffs!`\Minnesota is great.  They played the Spurs hard for about 30 minutes.`\is jonathon simmons related to ron simmons cuz...DAMN`\Expecting to lose cheering the Boban.

That was scary af. `\Wiggins glides so effortlessly `\The kings need Kevin Martin back to make them great. `\guy was so swole`\Someone needs to take 3's!`\Lmao so many mad Spurs fans. `\Billy Donovan looks like the kind of dude who apologizes for his house being dirty when you drop by and then you go inside and it's spotless. `\yes, you and 1/2 the east`\Haha nice`\And a legit NBA backup center, and a legit NBA backup point guard.`\I'm ready for Saturday.`\but you know, it's only a 2 point [game](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzpndHtdl9A)....`\Don't worry, we excel at blowing big first half leads.`\Fucking Spurs man lol ....SMDH

Note: Data from basketball-reference, March 25th.
>> `\BUZZ BUZZ MOTHERFUCKERS!!!!! `\Danny what the fuck`\I don't think anyone unironically thought that was going to happen.

Edit: why do you have a Spurs flair?`\Fuck Tony Parker. `\It would have been a lot closer, Spurs would have to put Kawhi on Bulter leaving Rose to feast.`\The Pelicans just cannot close out games`\Ugly game..`\Nah but dj quake plays good throwbacks`\IF, that's a big if lets hope so, but he's gotta perform for 7 games in playoff mode.`\suck my dick cheating ass refs`\Clinched HCA in the Finals too.`\Six points!  In San Antonio!  I have (slight) hope for Monday!`\son and friends`\Yeah, sure. `\I didn't think anyone else noticed that. It's so weird.`\well to be fair, that lead was 2 points and against a team that had won 31 straight home games`\Definitely will be helpful for the Spurs. `\Towns is gonna get all he wants without Duncan `\I....what? Is that a saying?`\Both fair assessments.`\Nothing against the spurs, always love watching them play and am hoping for an epic WCF, but if a few more teams could hand them L's so we clinch the 1 seed and pop sits guys giving us the record, that would be great.`\Not only is Danny cold, but the entire team is.... Wow Timmy, wow lol.`\Refs have been pretty inconsistent all year, guessing they just thought he went straight up.`\Probably, but someone has to actually step up. No one's done that.`\Me too thanks.`\He's going to have to step up tonight if things keep going this way...`\Excellent D on Kawhi by J Rich`\Are people getting paid to shit on Danny Green? Calm down dudes, you've got a good team and he's still phenomenal on defense. I'd take him over Roberson any day.`\lmao Russ scared my dog with that rim slam`\and we love Curry`\yes - he's a winner`\Spurs vs. Pistons final confirmed`\You're schedule is partially hard because you play us 3 times. But that means our schedule is hard because we play you 3 times`\I don't understand why Kyle doesn't just shoot that.`\Damn looked like Simmons had a straight path to the basket there`\HERE COMES AUSTIN RIVERS`\Losing is one thing, losing like that, though?

As someone who has been dealing with it quite often recently, it's fucking awful every time`\Memes are a fairly large part of reddit...if they upset you this much then maybe this isn't the place for you. `\I was a Freshmen. Saw all the 90's glory live and was old enough to remember it all. Such a good time.



Ballin' in the street, betting basketball cards(I think I won a Duncan rookie card this way, and some Jordon cards), and then heading home to watch basketball at night and then play video games. Sega for life.`\wiggins got a games worth of rebounds for him in just that quarter, nice work.`\Best player=Mvp??`\Fuck the Clippers`\God damn it`\What's Anderson, then?  "Glacier-like"?`\Let's be real Singler isn't responsible for everyone else's poor performance off the bench.`\The Wolves arena was playing "All My Ex's Live in Texas", in case you were wondering if this was going to be a friendly away crowd.`\Wow, West didn't even play`\michelob tastes like water`\It's just not our night. We're not gonna win.`\Who's playing next?`\I noticed a pattern in most of the games this season. When Parker leaves the game they end up going on a run. He is hurting them more than helping them. `\Aldridge-Duncan isn't even fair`\I kinda wanna see Ray go off tonight.`\uh... what?`\I really don't like them `\outside of LMA and Kawhi we're cold as fuck`\Brian Davis needs to stop calling Durant Westbrook, haha. That's at least twice this game. `\Yep. Oldest player to record his first triple double?`\So you heave a halfcourt prayer but you fake yourself out from closer 3 pointers lol.`\Whiteside doesn't know what to do with him. He should elbow him again so that he doesn't have to keep getting embarrassed `\SUGAR K LEONARD LETS GO`\maybe he just likes Applebee's`\If they pull this out it will make my week.`\i'll take it split over 2 years at this point...`\Easy to say when you're a fan of a team like the Spurs lol `\Please be the game where Green regains his confidence.`\You know, when the going gets rough everyone says Westbrook and KD can't co exist. But these guys disappear when they combine for 90 or when they combine for like 50pts 20rebs 30ast.

It's been hard post ASB but KD and Westbrook are still the best duo in the league. They'll show up in the playoffs. I have faith `\Those minutes after Mills subbed in for Parker went by quick.  Leonard and Aldridge went off.`\WHAT A PASS!!!!!!!!!!!`\But in 2011, "we too old"`\This same thing happened with Monty. No matter what, AD just doesn't get the ball enough. `\Never happen`\"~~Leonard~~ Green on the follow!!"`\Especially last year, Timmy's defense was just beautiful to watch. `\Imma chill that beverage!`\Travel???`\Chris paul can't play 48 minutes a game. `\Trash Talk with Danny Green lol`\Fuck yeah Kawhi! To think that he has yet to peak. Spurs are blessed. `\We loved West but it was mutually beneficial. He just allowed us to start our rebuild a year earlier `\The Spurs are really solid on their rotations and help right now.`\Can we get Lin on the side bar picture for the front game pls, he played outstanding tonight `\They've taken a step back from their earlier historical defensive rating. `\just you`\Kawhi graduated from saying nothing to still saying nothing, but with a lot words`\There's been less of it this year. I almost thought we were free of it.`\Whats the deal with that? Is it serious?`\The Hornets did actually beat the Bulls that year.  IIRC the Hornets were one of their two home losses.`\Jump shooting bigs fucking kill Kanter`\Boban scored more than those 3`\That Tarzan commercial gets me everytime`\Yeah, but I'm talking about the garbage time lineup out there right now.`\His D overshadowed by Kawhi's maybe?`\They had an easy schedule lately and they're in the east.`\Im just going to assume that Pop has accepted the 2nd seed and is experimenting with lineups. `\I feel like there are like 0 jersey stores now. There were like a fuckton right before christmas, but I can only find one store on there selling Spurs Jerseys, and they're the normal black ones.`\*warriors frantically try to trade stephen curry for jeremy lin*`\WTF are you talking about? Spurs are the best defensive team in the NBA by a longshot, and have 0 issues. They are also 59-10, please stop complaining. `\If NBA allowed players to step on the sidelines when they have he ball Austin Rivers would cut down his turnovers by 90%`\What if he was a Mav?`\If you keep SVG and give him time you have a chance of that happening`\Also where's the Juice??`\Holy shit. Pacers announcer saying Timmy deserves a tech! LMAO`\Duncan, Manu and Parker are out? also, Minny you have my favorite color commentator. `\Jeremy Lin   r/makemesmile`\Wish Kyle Anderson was on the Wolves.`\1 of the requirements to play for the Spurs is you need a post fadeaway `\I thought that throwing the ball at someone's legs isn't automatically a kickball? `\That dirty ass player! `\Why the fuck does Danny EVER try those weird ass floaters when he's capable of shit like THAT!?`\Plantar fasciitis. `\I can say anything I want! No one will see this! Photograph by nickelback is a good song!`\LIN`\Fuck amare `\Spurs top scorers:

Kawhi Leonard - 32

Boban Marjanovic - 15

Kevin Martin - 12

what`\Harris and Morris are hitting their shots. Open jumpers on our end are not going down. No Boban.`\D West momentum time`\gotta be the worst ref in the league`\I think Patty still needs to work on commanding the floor if he's going to start for Parker though. He's still mainly just finding open shots recently, but I think in time he totally could.`\Missed and 1 but ok. Single digits `\Y'all some salty ass bitches in here. `\THAT PASS

THAT DUNK`\Danny get your shit together, luckily Kawhi grabbed your brick and swish the game winning 3.
`\Why does Donovan insist we play Singler? Morrow has been balling.`\[Seems you're right](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenichi_Ebina) `\Danny Green shot like hot garbage, he's gotta pick it up in time for the playoffs`\Blow it up?`\Patty!`\leopard is a damn good nickname though. `\San Antonio your commentators are fantastically unbiased. It's great`\It's so fun to watch the best teams turn it on like that. It sucks when they do it to your team, but it's fun with everyone else.`\I like the pistons for this one..Drummond is a beast`\Derek fisher `\CONTINUATION?!!! `\that 4th quarter was like a glimpse into what we are capable of when every cylinder clicks, scoring 37 and holding opponent to 17 pts`\Literally a goddamn miracle when he makes a shot. `\fam`\I gotcha, I feel silly for not thinking about all of that but I mostly just watch NBA and CFB. It makes sense I guess. To your last point, and I'm just one person my first favorite team was the Mavs, Dirk is still the only NBA jersey I own. As soon as the OKC Hornets came to town though I was all aboard the train, same with the Thunder. It's irrational for me to be like, legitmately upset that someone doesn't rep their home town team but I honestly do give people the eye if I'm walking around the mall and I see a dude decked out in Lakers gear or something similar.`\Just started watching. I was under the assumption Leonard was going to play. Poo.`\dieng has to stop taking the ball down`\[Spurs gameplan second half](http://www.keepitahundred.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/square_peg_in_round_hole_2.jpg)`\How`\It's a close game with a finals contender. Asking for more is greedy.`\Do people really think "gay" is an insult now? lol`\"GET THAT SHIT OUTTA HERE"-Aldridge, probably`\threeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee`\Oh God Sean Elliot is absolutely merciless to Tim Duncan`\Patty mills > tony parker`\Just call it. Come on! `\Turnovers non stop. `\You're the real MVP. Now just don't miss another game.`\well the spurs obviously dont give a fuck. They arent taking this game seriously at all`\Me too. He's always hustling and has made some pretty big improvements this year.`\Why do we suck in New Orleans`\He aint gon tell you where that gumbo spot is tho`\THanks!`\Why i can't see any posts in smaller threads? `\I don't know what I expected..
Jk kawhi and Lma are gods though, kinda unfair`\Him and Jimmy Butler are way stronger than they appear.`\.4 left tho`\oh most definitely, he was unstoppable`\I do too, but Baynes didn't do himself any favors by jumping forward either.`\sorry to hear that`\How do you know Donovan isn't providing any kind of help? I watch almost every Thunder game and I have no idea what kind of help the coach is providing any player. There has never been any indication from Russ or KD that I've heard that Donovan isn't doing enough to help the team.`\well there is no logical explanation that they win against the best team in the league and play like shit against the HORNETS`\I do agree with you, but it's definitely debatable. Westbrook has massively improved his playmaking since Harden was last in OKC.`\Lawson playing well`\Red mamba ssssssssss`\Seems Green is the wipping boy. He's been shooting much better in 2016. He's up to 35% from 3pt overall for the season now.

edit: TO get to 35% for the season, he had to shoot 49.1 in Jan and 36.7% in Feb of 2016.`\Kawhi gonna get over 30 tonight? `\That halftime show was dope`\The Lakers are fucking weird.`\I don't know what to think of kevin martin yet. `\Payne stopped playing. Foye and durant are trying to run backup point. Durant is doing okay though. Foye should be a spot up three shooter and on for defense. Kanter doesnt play enough. Westbrook is being hard headed and he is so frustrated on a nightly basis. His own fury is getting to him. Serge is playing below par from his previous seasons. I hope he can get better again.

But more than anything else....we have a rookie head coach who lost his two most important staff members. Not to mention, the deaths that this team as a whole faced in the last month have been devastating. With both Cheeks and Williams out, Williams for the rest of the season, and no one experienced enough to guide him, and our team, through some of the worst adversity it has ever face, we fail down the stretch. Our stars do too much, and dont execute the same way as the first 3 quarters. We falter. We lose. Thats it.

I would trade these deaths for repairable injuries any day. I just hope the Thunder come out of it. We all miss watching them play tough basketball.`\Dam, seconds Parker is in we fall behind.  ugg.`\And you told me I jinxed it!`\I remember that guy he can get up`\No I keep my salt here `\Go to your taskbar/click on the notifications icon near the date and time/click off of tablet mode.  I hope thats the fix`\You can tell he's feeling much more comfortable. Taking shots without hesitation and making some great passes. `\I mean, he did go 0-7. One shot would've made a difference.`\Damn lucky shot by the scrub`\Love lance!`\Maybe 3 years ago he could do that.  He's lost his outside shot and the only defense he might play is hacking DeAndre`\No he will be reprimanded and forced to write an apology. `\Get fuck`\This is a fuckin Spurs vs Pistons game. Why are seeing a Curry graph?`\There was more time on the game clock than the shot clock. `\he's more comfortable coming off the bench (I think he should start in the future but since he had the minutes restriction until January I'm fine with ~~it~~ his not starting remaining through this year) and Gentry likes it so he can manage his minutes more easily. I don't really think it's a big deal. He still plays starter's minutes, he just doesn't play the first several minutes of the game.`\Well yeah, that's obvious. I don't see how that contributes to someone saying they're leaving though.`\Brooks would have us closing in on 60 games right now, but we've got to win out the rest of our games to get there. I don't understand why Donovan was brought in since his decision making is orders of magnitude worse than Brooks'.`\No check the username`\Spurs beat Warriors - Hornets beat Spurs.

It adds up. `\There's [this](http://www.nba.com/grizzlies/video/green-with-envy-151113), but I think there were a few others with the exact same concept and the same flawless acting`\How can you go from looking so good to looking so bad? Howwwww?`\Yeah that is really annoying `\It shouldn't of been. Awful call. `\I hope the Grizzlies get healthy soon. We should win this one by double digits, even if Kawhi sits`\[Adams breaks through the double with some nifty footwork](https://streamable.com/5kms)`\That's likely true. I'm just unsure what kind of position he'd be awarded. `\watch out thunder bros, andre miller old man moves in bound (ง'̀-'́)ง`\What a defensive performance by San Antonio. Gotta give props where it's due. Great game. `\6 points in 7 minutes is unacceptable`\They've played a different rap song everytime the Spurs have the ball.  I like it.`\I mean I'll take his 33% average over the 20% he's been shooting in March. He shot really well in Jan/Feb and I'm actually pretty confident he'll get his shot back by the playoffs.`\They've blown the most 4th quarter leads in the entire league lol. What are you even talkin about bud.`\By not resting 4 key players?`\but Boban is only what, 2 years older?`\She is nothing more than a talking head. She was talking about Kyrie tonight and said "is he just a 23 year old or....." about 5 different times.`\I'm 90% sure that Lin is going to opt out and price himself out of Charlotte.  This game pretty much sealed it.`\Because Pop isn't there to call the refs on their bullshit. `\23 FTs? 10 in the quarter? Holy shit

And only 11 for the Spurs? I didn't start watching until the start of the 3rd, but I'm guessing Spurs fans are pissed

If a team had almost as many FTs in 1 quarter as the Thunder had through 3 quarters, I'd be cussing out of the refs so hard.

/it's the lady ref

//shocker`\Oh my gosh c'mon spurs. All you had to do was get the hornets off Miami's ass. `\That AUG game.`\How dare he!!! ��`\Lol at the mods removing it. You'll be labeled a racist if you tell someone your car is black on this site. Take it in stride, as I know you do.`\What do you use to place bets?`\Over my disabled body`\Couldn't help it. I hate being on the shit end of calls when we're already playing like ass`\That was considerate of him.`\it does`\I have a shirt with the phrase.  I'm always skittish to wear it in public because of this.`\it works tho`\Not much. He only got a few minutes. I'm not even sure if he took a shot actually.`\He's a vet that won't make rookie mistakes when the stakes are high in the playoffs, just in case we need to use him.`\Guess the game plan called for us to take contested twos all night.`\I still love you Danny!`\If our offense runs like it did tonight, we'll be in great shape. Rose was more or less tearing us up though (in that he was driving to the hoop and laying it up pretty easily at times), so I can only assume that Westbrook will do the same. Hopefully our defense will be up to standard.`\so an out loud email?`\Finally Kawhi gets a whistle.`\if roberson could get his 3p shooting to a not terrible level we would be soooooo good.`\Fuck Derek Fisher`\Well that was a fun quarter.

Not sure if he took a shot though `\They kind of do that with every city that is not LA or NY. But you guys are very stereotypable. `\fast breaks are not good for us!!!! slow down!`\Hopefully.

On the one hand he's insanely effective going bananas on the court, on the other hand, it fucks with him and cause him to make poor decisions. I'm sure the tradeoff is generally in his favor... But damn is it aggravating to watch sometimes. `\Simmons flying AIR CONGO!!!`\Oh I gotcha. Lol I was talking about how it was awesome that Minnesota was playing All My Exes with Miller coming back into town and starting against them. `\Within 10.

When Steph Curry shoots a 3, it will probably miss.

I'm not digging any holes here. Your input was both wrong and irrelevant to the discussion. Just because other idiots agree with you doesn't make it not wrong.

If Steph Curry shoots a three, is it probably going to miss? If yes, I'm right. If no, you need to check your stats because it's probably going to miss.`\Ugh Ryan Hollins... Turnover and the fouls. `\THATS WHY YOU LOST BY 43 LAST NIGHT`\Exactly! Guy works so hard on court. His passing is on point, he sets good screens, he's so useful in transition. He just keeps at it.

Going 4-8 since All-Star break

Losing 12 games when leading after three quarters, including a *major* meltdown against LAC

Letting Westbrook intentionally give games away when they're close

Firing your coach because he didn't run an offense or control his stars, then replace him with a guy who is somehow even worse at both of those


Those are embarrassing. `\Let down?`\I would be disappointed if we lost by 75`\The real blueprint: score 7 in the first quarter.`\I fap evrtm`\I still remember when we were on the receiving end of those`\First game for me too!

Never heard of 'em."`\It's really weird how much he obsesses over my comments specifically, trying to prove that I'm a "fake fan."

Bulls got bailed out with the really late call against Danny. And then that one was probably actually a foul on Gibson.`\Fucking lethal by the Spurs in the last 5 minutes. Chuck is gonna love it.`\Curry corner 3s`\You'd think they would have a feed on their planes.`\*THE HAND THAT FEEDS*`\did Pop just tell Lin he did a good job??`\Hornets to Finals`\Wasnt it Westbrook tht killed the Spurs in the 1st game of the season.

The San Antonio Spurs (59-10) win by forfeit of game over The Golden State Warriors (61-7) due to reddit negotiations. `\This was the most entertaining game I've seen in some time where neither team reached 100 points and neither team shot over 40% from the field.

OKC's defensive intensity really impressed me, but they just weren't able to get anything going offensively because SA's defense *is that good..*

I would love to see these 2 teams slug it out in the playoffs. `\If they can't win with each other they're not winning without.`\I have and this was next level. and Pop sits his ass down when he misses them.`\Kyle Anderson is Freq right now.`\Man if LMA can produce like this with Kawhi on the court, we'd take our offense to the next level. Those two score so much when the other is taking a backseat. `\In 33 minutes too`\Needs to teach Green his ways. Holy shit`\Dribble Jones y'all`\Hit him across the head. They're just checking to make sure, It's a common foul anyways.`\So it's a normal game thread? Every game thread is filled with complaints about the refs or something else.`\a lot of them were bad shot selections....

and no comment for Morrow's layup`\It was a good night for Bonner to retire?`\Boban didn't jump to dunk that `\We've got 4 point guards and Boban on the court right now.`\A year ago tonight was our last loss at home.

He's just overrated as a shooter.`\We finally look good on offense for once`\get KD and Russ outta there mane
`\That was alright.`\We won't. We could get away with it if there wasn't another all time great team in the same damn conference this year. We really need to hope he heats up at least a little before the playoffs. We gotta be firing on all cylinders to take the Warriors down.`\If parker can transition to a Stockton game with LMA as Malone's role, then parker can stay a starter.`\If the hornets can keep the Spurs scoreless the rest of the game and match their own point total each quarter from the 1st they could sent it to OT`\The Spurs are so old, it takes them until the 3rd quarter to warm up their engines.`\THE ANDRE MILLER ERA BABY`\Let's see, he fouled Lin at the 3 for an and-1. He turned it over once and on two separate occasions didn't rotate well and let a Hornet score. I'd say he didn't play well. `\Lin used too much hip and booty apparently. Iffy call but not that controversial. `\Pretty shitty game by both teams, outside of LMA. Still not sold on Simmons, makes some great plays here and there but follows them up with a few boneheaded ones`\As soon as Patty replaced Parker everything clicked. He is so much better for our offense now. `\You are always trashing on Lin, it's the only reason why I comment on Kemba in the first place.

The thing is you seem to think that anyone questioning Kemba's performance is trashing him.`\Are the Grizzlies going to win another game?`\I miss the old K Love`\nooooooice`\Those defensive 3 second calls. And people fault West for being mad. It was justified.`\Bro, I just gotta graduate! Lol`\Stop bitching. You got calls for you the whole game. `\Going in the second with a rested Drummond too.`\OMG another Kernel?`\All the spurs fans complaining about continuation, that play is continuation 100% of the time at any point of an NBA game. `\1st team all defense! /s`\Curry took all of their 3pt power`\Would rather play them than the Clippers once Blake gets back`\Yeah I mean these guys alone got us to 61-11 `\warming up? :P Seriously creepy smile `\We're angry at the refs AND our bullshit shooting`\YESS! Great win,  Pacers!! Enduring this obnoxious thread made it even better!`\Is any one elses tnt feed kinda choppy or weird. `\Yeah it's sorta unsettling to imagine GRRM sitting there writing about Cersei licking the jizz off her hands... Pretty sure he even described the taste, what the fuck G? `\I like the guy and want to see him do well but at some point some major change has to happen if he cant produce.`\man, Spurs actually got more talents than GSW... it's just that they are all past their prime.. `\It's hard for the Spurs to gain momentum with all these inconsistent calls! `\Chuck on point`\Ya i was wondering the same thing throughout the whole game.`\For New Orleans being such a party town, that crowd is super dead. `\Williams, Wiggins, Beasley, Muhammad all have the same problem none of them can contribute in anything other than scoring and all aren't good from the 3pt line. Beasley was a beast on the glass in college idk where that went.`\Same. I'm really loving our fluidity when the offense starts to click.`\The average night he shoots very poorly ....`\You're right, pretty sure I remember that from a few highlight videos.`\I'm no ref expert, but she does tend to be in quite a few memorably badly reffed games.`\That's the power of defense.`\Parker has always been weird with NOLA.

I really hope we meet in the WCF and have a great series`\Are you fucking kidding me? Jeremy Lin had 29?`\Timmy really mad lol`\Okc "choking" on Saturday.`\Celtics could have been the dynasty. 30% plus of opportunity to get Duncan. Still can't believe how you weren't able to get him. `\Also Hayward would have to be traded for a solid roleplayer at a DIFFERENT position which would be tough to negotiate.

He will probably also just go to whatever team offers him the most money. Celtics have a good chance there.`\None of the players you mentioned give you nearly the longevity or the two way dominance that Duncan does. Not to mention that the absolute lack of drama that Duncan brings to the table. `\I read that Charlotte actually has the third best record in the NBA since January, so I hope no one is taking this game for granted.`\Your gif game is strong son`\Hey man thanks for posting the box score.

Mostly playoff teams `\Well his current 3PT% is one reason`\Spurs and Warriors are insane with the speed of their runs. I love them for their differences in the way they do it as well.

"We're actually down right now? The fuck!"`\yeah I am unsure what happens to Anderson...he wanted to come to Spurs and the Spurs organization seems committed to improving him year after year.  it comes down to if he wants to leave to find a starting position versus what the Spurs system has for him

DeAndre isn't posting up by himself. Mbah a Moute is ass on offense. Reddick is able to create a little bit just by how much he moves around to get open, but he still needs guys to feed him.

But there's so much more to a player's contributions than his shooting. Making him a starter is on Pop. Pop obviously has worked out the math on this and has figured out that even if Danny doesn't shoot well now,  he still does a lot of other good stuff.`\I think (and hope) that he wants to stay in San Antonio with the same teammates.  He seems to like the city a lot.`\Thx Spurs <3`\You guys tanked to the 8th seed to face us because we were injured. NEVER FORGIVE.`\Where is the gif of Durant dancing in the beginning?`\Guys aren't helping the team sometimes- certain fill spots aren't being run to to properly open up a passing lane.

They didn't address the pg depth because they are expecting Parker to defend Westbrook and Curry in two playoff series and survive. No way. They need a younger, athletic pg who can defend. It's frustrating to watch him play with Kawhi & the starters. The ball sticks with him, not enough ball movement and it's clear as day he is refusing to pass to Kawhi. Icing him out. I'm telling you, something going on there. Tony isn't the #1 option anymore so why is he forcing the issue? Pride? He doesn't have to prove himself anymore, he's a 4x champion. Let Kawhi and LMA shine now. Jeez.`\Omg over a year of this app and I never knew this. Thank you, good sir/madam. `\:(`\Man, something about getting their arses handed to them by the Cavs have tightened the Clippers up a touch on the perimeter.

Guess that's the price of being a Spurs fan; we can't really enjoy success like others do.`\Me too. He should start tomorrow.

I love that guy.`\DAE think Patty's in to get prepped to guard curry in the WCFs?`\Haha. Career high of 19 pts in a quarter and a half! `\Don't forget Dgreen guys. With D G out we have both of the "Big D" Brothers out.
`\That was like a train wreck that I couldn't stop watching`\He's a 3 and D guy and people seem to forget that, especially the D part. But he does a lot of good things on the court, regardless. Shit, people keep thinking he's shooting bad. He's up to 35% from 3pt line and shot 49.1% from 3pt in Jan and like 36.7% in Feb. `\> No Boban.

We're missing Johnson, Tolliver and Meeks. I think that outweighs Boban haha. `\Now its just silly`\Mills can't run the offense even close to how Tony can and if you make Mills the starter and have him take on Tony's minutes and responsibilities then he won't be able to come off the bench late in games and be the sparkplug that just won them the game.

Every time Tony has a bad game certain subsets of the Spurs fanbase go apeshit and start demanding Mills start, and every time it gets shut down because it makes zero sense and would be the wrong move.`\Great game, lin was hot as shit. Best game I've watched in a while`\Timmy laughing his ass off! `\It was a two`\Lincredible.`\Tank Flight!`\It's okay.

This team has been top of the West for years and they're losing a few games and its like the sky is falling. It happens. I understand you don't want to see them lose, but the Spurs & Warriors are both on historic paces. The 4th quarter collapses suck, but they'll get out of this rough patch. All that matters is playoffs.

**EDIT:** FOUR YEARS OF REDDIT ON VARIOUS ACCOUNT AND I'VE BEEN GILDED FOR THE FIRST TIME THANK YOU MY HYPE LEVEL IS AT AN ALL TIME HIGH`\Very cool dude and we unanimously love him, we're all on the CamPayne Hype Train.

He's going through some growing pains right now like most rookies but he's showed solid playmaking and spot up 3 skills and is getting better on defense, the perfect backup point guard.

Wasn't there a thread about holding the Hornets to something like 10 points in the first quarter?`\:(`\So, it's been an entire half, and I haven't seen any Spurs on the court yet. Am I missing something? Why is Miami playing by themselves?`\Fuck this shit. Nobody can make anything `\Bruh nobody said that about the friggin spurs`\Magnet only on one side. `\That one guy trying to hide has regrets though`\Maybe stop being so fucking sarcastic. We could have been a historically great team ourselves if we didn't trade Harden, and then proceed to make stupid trades year after year. We could have also gotten there by getting rid of Scott Brooks sooner than we did. But keep thinking that our FO is blameless when our two generational superstars (if they're even around) waste their primes away while we keep making bad decisions. `\Ettore Messina asked how his boy Rubio was doing during a pre game media scrum.

So I guess that answers the question of who the Spurs PG will be when Parker retires.

`\Why is KD coming in?`\lol we're from Texas! If it isn't a y'all I just assume singular. Either way I hope we face off in the playoffs because of the shit talking that has gone on the last few years and it's been too long since we matched up. `\what a shit shitarrific game`\Did Kawhi just pound his chest after that shot? Emotion!`\now you know why his ass hasn't gotten cut

Since everyone else sucks.`\How does Dion Waiters justify taking a contested step back two with Kevin Durant on the floor with him? smh`\So much for a game where we are supposed to be able to manage KD and WB's minutes lol.

Pretty unbiased.`\Boban making Whiteside look tiny out there.`\AD should be shooting the ball 20 times a game`\"and all he needs is a split second...

As if the game itself wasn't long enough lol`\Lmao IDK why he brought up Carlito's Way, but it seemed it was just to show off basic misinformation`\Old man game`\I dont watch the clippers alot but it seems like no one outside of Paul can create their own shot, if you just get the ball out of his hands, they can't do much aside from dinks and dunks from their big-men and inconsistent shooting from their spot-up men. I dont see this team going anywhere in the playoffs.`\As long as he's back for the Warriors game, I'm happy that he's resting up.`\Two air balls in a row?`\Why the fuck is tony back in`\yup gg `\**21/12**`\HAMBURGLAR`\Seriously that's why AD always gets hurt. He causes so much trouble to other guys they just get physical with him and hit him and push him around.`\20-7 in their last 27 (that's one-third of the regular season). 60-win pace.

Ninth in offense, fifth in defense, fifth in Net Rating during that time.

EDIT: They can keep it up, too. Of their thirteen remaining games (including this game against SAS), only three are against really good teams. Nine of their remaining games are against teams currently not in the playoffs, including two against Philadelphia and two against Brooklyn. `\That was cool.`\That 0.3 shot clock started a tad early, but hey what do I know?

Pau himself almost had as many as the entire spurs squad.

Sure we lost 8 outta 12 games, but stop freaking out about TRADING Westbrook like KD would be perfectly okay with that. Westbrook is still a strong contender for the best all around PG in the league, and KD/WB is the best 1-2 in the league. We're not trading Westbrook lol, nice try at trying to pull another Harden trade on us.`\Even if we beat them 3 times, we can't guarantee that :P`\The one Donald Trump likes the most?`\Glad Westbrook is back in, he sets the team pace better than KD`\what a bullshit travel call`\thought that was hilarious haha`\Lol I noticed Green was trying to do that the whole game, finally got it to go.`\Sample size.`\Go Spurs Go`\LIN FOR THE SIDEBAR!`\I read that Giannis used to take too long on his FTs and was made to change his routine.`\yeah this officiating is brutal`\Big men shooting on fire.  `\I humbly accept this duty `\Right? Grizz are fucked by injuries and it's easy to talk shit with no flair `\pels guards are a joke`\Whatcha gonna do. At least we have a nice draft pick this year`\Oh fuck.`\I understand you're mad (and honestly I don't know why), but I hope you understand that A LOT of people in North Carolina, specifically Charlotte, aren't from NC, a lot of people move up here from Texas and Florida, and down here from NJ and NY.

Those people could be legit Spurs fans.`\Time for the Spurs to get some Australian revenge.`\NASTY`\I'm from Sa I'm just here with my son he had surgery in dricolls children hospital`\Yeah, you would.`\West was huge tonight.  Both offensively and defensively `\I don't think the spurs will win any of the games against the warriors tbh. If that last game they played in Oakland was a preview, it's gonna be another blowout loss.`\You gotta admit it's a bit ridiculous.`\Basketball reasons. `\Loving Lawson so far`\Mills is high-key good go us off the bench.`\*eye roll*

Yeah okay. Well they are out now so no need to worry. `\good game guys! no excuses, yall played better tonight.`\Eye witnesses have told us that the only thing Ellis did not make away with were Wade's rings.`\What? None of those guys have been reported as sitting`\We aren't going to get a fucking whistle on any drive`\I think Durant is the bigger problem. I trust Mills/Simmons moreso than I trust Slomo to stop Durant. Beyond Slomo, who is covering Durant?`\NOLA fucking bring it home tonight`\Shhhhh, another team will poach her`\it's like finding a tiny puddle in the desert`\I'm glad you lost your team. `\I turn the game on, we're up 7 with 5 mins to go.

Take care of them knees big fella! He's fun to watch.`\DAAAMN that was a nice shot.`\Took the foot off the pedal, and the Clippers have the momentum going into the second half.

I called it too`\honestly your roster is precisely what gives the Spurs fits. An athletic dominant big man can really do a number.

I mean Cody's a decent role player I guess`\anyone know where vlc stream instructions are?`\Solid quarter. Kawhi is going off but defense could be better.`\Raptors, Warriors, and Thunder to go undefeated at home. Tough task.

Hope he's okay! `\Great game from Jeremy Lin and Courtney Lee!  I need a minute to digest this crazy game.`\Just quoting a fan at the game. `\He's been great all season, just slowed down recently. People here just like bitching and acting like they know what they're talking about.

He's having a pretty bad game, let's not forget that he's done good this season in general.`\I hope someone has a clip`\Lol`\Nope`\Doesn't matter how this game goes. Joey Crawford is out of the NBA forever. Today was a good day. `\Hi guys! Just woke up (it's 9am here). Well, I'm surprised we aren't down by a lot.`\Camo joke`\Upvote for the flair. I miss cojo`\He's probably talking about Minnesota.`\not the same team without Coach Pop at the helm...`\As if your past already wasn't good enough. :(`\With the Hornets I believe`\Well lately we've been resting him for the 4th so pretty good :D

He's fine as long as he isn't trying to force shit`\Motherfuckers passing up open looks to give it to him with 2 seconds on the shot clock `\# ARON BAYNES THE SECRET WEAPON!!!`\and there goes a competitive game.`\If Drummond could make free throws he'd prob be able to leverage another ten million dollars on a contract `\He's been shooting lights out the past month or so, done a great job since manu broke his balls.

GO SPURS GO!!!`\Im not sure what we will do when CJ is healthy again because I am loving the effort Solo is giving us recently. He's all hustle and you can't teach that`\PATTY IS LOVE PATTY IS LIFE`\MY GOD IT'S BEAUTIFUL!`\Well that fucking sucked. I don't think he even got blocked he just missed it...`\Solid defence. Signs of the Spurs recovering that historical defence they had early in the season.`\I watched the whole game. I never thought bulls had a chance. After tht Holiday 3, the spurs starters came back in and the game was done right away `\Hate when people get downvoted for telling the truth. You are right relying on an injury prone Parker through four rounds is unrealistic. `\GINOBILI ON THE FINISH. `\What the fuck was Mills doing there? He literally touches Parker who is behind him covering the guy going baseline with Lin literally infront of his face, and he runs off after the guy going baseline?`\Jackson is quick as hell. He mudered us every time when he was in OKC.`\And there's another 20 point kd game`\Aldridge is still pretty smart about looking to drive before shoot.  `\I expect him to make another big move this summer because the Spurs are falling off a big cliff if both TD and Manu retires. The transition is too big. I would like another big-ish sign.`\Sexy pickpocket by Kyle`\It's insane how Kawhi has only one 30 point game this season, he is only taking 15 shots, if he took more i bet his scoring average would be way higher`\...

Yeah. I didn't actually follow the link and just presumed it was a basketballreference or something. I'm not always bright.`\no`\Yes. On a Mac. I'll try some stuff. Thanks!`\Wasn't he on the Warriors once? `\Thunder fans wont like it, but one of the "what ifs" we'll be talking about in like 30 years will be what if OKC never traded Harden.

LET'S GO.`\good i want a good close game after the day i had to day.. with a win of course`\Nope, no resting. Thinking back, it does make sense.

Didn't think the score would look anything close to this `\If we lose this one, we're probably resting guys every night from here on out. lol`\Yeah. We have a big game tomorrow night. Boban can score. `\Fuck Ray Allen, Imma kill thatniggajigga`\I'd rather have Matt Bonner on this team than Kevin Durant.`\I wonder if that, among other reasons, is why LA chose San Antonio`\That's why he's proud. Though he spoke a little too soon about being tied.`\Our bench unit was Anderson and West in the front court. `\Jordan Crawford can, but that's about it.`\that was closer than it should have been`\Out of those comments that you read to get to this far down, why was this the one that you had an issue with?`\Vintage Timmy D type of night`\This pace is too much for Boban`\Lmao one spin move too many. He forgot where he was`\I've seen mad Monta on Dallas no thank you.`\It was a two point league to the Spurs at home on the second night of a back to back.

Get the fuck out of here`\Who thinks Bonner or Martin might get some minutes in this game?`\I don't think we ever signed him.

I don't csre about the L. I'm a basketball fan before a Spurs fan. `\He was making a weed joke`\I'll give you that call and you'd still be up 15 whistles`\Damn. At least we didn't get blown out that bad.`\Danny. Our lone starter`\But winners don't laugh, if he isn't serious like Tim Duncan hell never win in the NBA!`\Parker took them out of the game repeatedly.

*wait*`\Dude has a full beer court side with 5 minutes left. How?`\Patty...why`\Damn Pistons cold af `\come on holiday, don't make stupid mistakes after playing so well`\Woah, so the Spurs 9 losses only came from good teams? Wow this team is a 1st round exit.

EDIT: Spurs fans don't know what sarcasm is.`\yeah Rivers jr is gonna win this game`\I absolutely agree. Dude is a menace. You can have your lillards and westbricks. I'd want CP3 on my team any day.`\GG. We play again at all this season?`\Tbh, we deserved to lose last year after dropping games against the fucking Knicks and then the Pelicans. That's disgraceful. But yeah, another series would be heart attack inducing. But that's the playoffs. `\Tony already getting some rest this weekend so that injury won't be a problem. `\Savage. `\It frustrates me so much when I watch them. `\I've been watching Spurs videos from the 2014 title run all day at work...I have no idea why, it just felt right.

So excited to be able to just relax and watch this game tonight`\No. I don't want you guys to ever get out of the second round. E.V.E.R!`\Parker was a fucking machine tonight. Easily his best game of the season.`\Couldn't be more disappointed.`\But he's been "at the end of his career for what feels like 5 or 6 years now. People keep writing him off but the dude grinds it out. I don't know if he will ever stop playing. Just gonna have to wheel his corpse off the court. `\AD didn't get to touch the ball more than 1 shot in the last 5 min. The one time he did he scored`\I mean, I don't think it is.

That's a helluva commute.`\Just wondering, how was this subreddit during Linsanity? `\No. The only thing that matters in this case is that it shows or talks about curry shooting 3s from the corner, not from whereeverthefuck you're talking about `\FORMA  WALL

This Portland team is gonna be fun to watch for the next couple years`\That Spurs possession to make it 72-67 by the Spurs was one of the most beautiful half-court sets I have ever seen`\i'm usually okay with watching the game on the Away feed but one of these commentators is getting on my nerves`\https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNIZofPB8ZM`\same`\I love HEB and I've never even been there, those commercials are too good`\They just stopped playing ball.

I just don't see it. Do you really think they can beat anyone in the 1st round? I mean I hope they knock the warriors or okc in the 1st but I just don't see it.`\They had won 10 in a row before this, so 5 years ago?

Big 3 and Kawhi are a go. `\Monta dpoy!`\Sloppy quarter plagued by whistles everywhere.`\Jeremy Lin defeats San Antonio Spurs`\Doubt it tonight.

Ftfy`\Great defense by us. Green and Kawhi were awesome. We couldn't hit anything in the 2nd and 3rd but LMA and Kawhi put the team on their back. `\Already been a year, last loss was March 12th.`\> he always responds "Esos caaaabrones" since they used to play us hard like 2-3 seasons ago

SMOOTH criminal!`\LOVE Kawhis fadeaway`\No, but really.  Even at full strength, there were nights where we didn't seem to understand many things.`\He's feeling the love.`\You bet your ass.`\Thanks Pacer friends.
You made me happy tonight`\but he sucks and we should trade him amiright? /s`\Spurs bench 40pts vs Clippers bench 12pts. That stat literally says why Clippers won't win big games like this`\Emotion from Kawhi!!! I'm loving it`\Good. I don't have to post my "Lin or Curry?" post anymore.

Who am I kidding, I will post in a couple of days. `\He's generally a good +/- player because his D helps and other guys usually are hitting when he's on the court. `\TOV% is a shitty metric. Guys that shoot more get rewarded `\Nelly son`\Rose should just be exempt from ever shooting anything outside the restricted area`\Do I hear a GSG chant?`\Gotta love SVGs enthusiasm, still getting mad as fuck on the sidelines despite the deficit`\I thought you're a hornets fan... not a nugget...`\Linsanity never ends `\Andre Miller is playing though?`\Well when Chris gets to take a dribble and extra step, and it's continuation, but Patty puts it up while being fouled and DJ grabs it out of the air. Ya. I'm serious. `\ANDRE MILLER - THE FUTURE`\sad because the bench looks better with Morrow and Payne in the lineup... Singler being out was a blessing for us...`\The logic sounds nice when you say it but it doesn't exactly work out like that here in the carolinas`\Why do they play us like this? `\Ibaka is not a premier stretch four anymore, not producing at the same level. Adams is tough for sure but his play doesn't translate to many more wins. Bench = awful. Anytime Kyle singler is getting significant minutes, things aren't going to go well. Obviously Payne has tremendous talent but isn't being utilized well enough and I think that's a case with a few of their players but the roster just isn't that good man. `\LA EASY MID RANGE COME ON MAN`\He did not play due to an illness.`\What do y'all think about the rotations tonight? I missed everything past the 1st quarter. Thoughts on Messina?`\Someone bring a whistle during the game for Danny. He almost always shoots it after the whistle!`\Why are some Spurs fans like this? Why so pretentious and so condescending? `\:(`\No dissapointment`\13 points, fucking pathetic I mean just might as well stop running to even play offense `\OHHHHHHHHHH DAMN`\Fuck you Green!`\Likewise. May the best team win. `\They are who we thought they were - coach Green`\wew Kyle`\Chuck was 100% on the money with his half time analysis of OKC`\Crawford looks like he has pneumonia `\Poor Rasual, this might have been his last game and he didnt even get to touch the ball`\Anyone else feel a bit unsatisfied after some of these wins? Like its great to get more victories but I feel like beating up on weaker teams doesn't really mean that much until we can prove we can take out the big guns by Playoff time`\At least Perk won't tip it into our own basket?`\has a team ever dodged as many bullets as the Pacers have tonigh?`\This is the most terrible that Lance has been since he's been here, eh?  It's pretty bad!`\Stay strong fam ✊`\He'll need to expand his repertoire. You see it sometimes, but he's still forcing things when he has to. Last night, you could see him force a lot of shots versus Paul George. He's not scared, but he lacks experience. `\Benching Parker or not having him be the primary ball handler in crunch time has been so good. GG`\Pop threw the game to avoid the media attention. He dodged a lot of press by maintaining the distance from Golden State. Just imagine day after day about how San Antonio is only 2 games behind, and then one, and then...

This way it all stays the same, like a shark waiting for the right time to strike. When it matters most.

Of course, this is just a thought.`\It's awesome to see that he's making up his lack of threes with putbacks and finger rolls`\As long as the Cavs dont win it, I am fine with you guys getting that 6th.`\Well the Pistons have so many nationally televised games what else is there to say about the team?`\Overtime lol`\BRINGO`\Hornets aren't that bad.`\As soul crushing as the injuries have been this seadon, I'm really excited about JaMychal and jerrell `\ALL BALL`\It's funny how we play an elite team on their own floor when we're up by 2 points going into the 4th and that's choking. But let's let the narrative play out. `\That's a long time`\Woof, Wiggins with the answer`\He's a by far a better playmaker than anyone in OKC.`\I think he's just talking to whoever passes him on the court at that time. He always seems to sit down for half the shoot around before yelling and running onto the court`\take good care of it`\San Antonio MidRangers`\He did? `\we're all classy guys here. youre scary, hes scary, we're all scary!`\The game was pretty good, then the Spurs Spurred `\Spurs being absolutely brutal.`\Lmao wtf`\K-Mart <3`\They still have Prince so its probably way up there. `\He knows the spurs inside and out`\It's from a comic making fun of neckbeards `\For some reason I'm surprised no team has ever gone undefeated at home. And this year two teams have a good chance of doing it. `\I mean...this game could be worse. So we have that going for us?`\you especially need him when nobody's shot is on Target`\He said the Spurs`\I'll admit I haven't watched many games recently, but what's with Jeff Green just getting the ball, dribbling to a random spot on the floor and then missing a shot?`\Phantom call.  `\FUCK YEAHHHHH BOYS!`\Danny. 10million per year `\At least they're above .500`\TD: Block me again AD and I will kill ya`\Oo yeah that is definitely a foul on TP `\I feel so bad for the thunder. What a weird combination of absurd talent and poor decision making (mainly by the front office to fill out their roster and by the coaches to make game plans and execute them). But you've gotta feel bad for guys like Durant and Westbrook who, even though they make mistakes, carry such a shitty bench through 82 games a season. `\Baynes has a killer mid to close jumper tho. Pop never trusted him enough to let him do it on a regular here.`\That one player looks kind of like Michael Finley `\That's just what I was thinking!`\Lol did Jrue really pass it to Gordon over Davis who had Danny Green on him?`\r/nbastreams`\He looks ashy`\COO COO COOLILILIO`\How`\It was Coach B`\the fact that we aren't being blown out is incredible, like idk if I should be happy about that or not `\I'm liking this so far`\FUCK YEAH, THAT'S THUNDER BASKETBALL!`\http://media.giphy.com/media/106PwpLIIXJnXi/giphy.gif`\Why not president_sandwiches then??`\Almost as good as MVP`\shooting 25%`\pls kill me`\Definitely was, I noticed Gibson's jumping spot slightly changed after Duncan walked off. Duncan won that tip wayy too easily for it not to be head games`\BOBAN SLAM`\I thought dumb calls were going both ways. Parker got fouled by Duncan then a couple plays later Parker looks at Jackson and get called for a foul.`\[When you can't convince people that you're not a fairweather Spurs fan because they've been contenders ever since you've been old enough to watch basketball](http://i.imgur.com/nw9cJ.gifv)`\Anderson remind anyone of Shelvin Mack?`\How long is KD gonna stay in lol`\Damn. I wonder why more stars don't come to SA, seeing that we're such strong contenders always. `\WOOOOOOOO`\You've always held on though. Clippers actually burned you last year.`\Curry.tho`\God thank you kanter for ending that crap run from both teams`\Flash seats is also partially to blame.`\The problem is no one else on this team can hit an open shot on the perimeter besides KD and ocassionally Serge. Russ' 3 ball is gone, Singler is washed, Dion Waiters isn't good, Roberson can't shoot, Foye's hot/cold, and Payne is the only other player with a semi reliable jumper and he doesn't get minutes. `\This is actually so true. Remember that play where he drove into traffic and somehow found Stuckey at the 3 point line? I thought that was a sure turnover, but then I realised that's actually what real point guards do.`\BANG!!!!!!!`\I got a great VLC stream right now. I just miss the simplicity of ballstreams. And the chat was pretty great.`\Well there was a little stretch there of random ass calls and several of them seemed to go towards the Spurs. Wasn't that big of a deal but it did favor the Spurs.`\Unlike a lot of people here, I'm optimistic about TP, but not this game--- 1-5 FG, 2 TO, and a net negative on both offence and defence. `\I like you, good warriors fan. `\I couldn't sit down in the 4th! Linsanity was back tonight.`\Man I swear if I saw one more thread like "Would you rather start a franchise with Jeremy Lin or Steph Curry", my head would have exploded.`\Yes. Oldest player to get a triple double for the first time. Matt Barnes at 36 this season. Fun fact, Zbo is the 3rd oldest at 34, also this season.`\Don't forget about Jonathan Simmons, who happens to be inactive right now.`\We need to play Miller, ginobili, butler, Duncan , and west one game for quite possibly he oldest lineup in NBA history`\Lin making up 57.1% of the 1st quarter output with that 4 point play`\DID GREEN JUST HIT AND 3 AND HAVE IT COUNT?`\Thanks. Went to the locker room to ice it? `\Mills went to the Manu Ginobili school of scoring points while sacrificing your body.`\I thought he's been sick lately`\I love aggressive Leonard, he knows this is his team `\Boban had this game circled after what Whiteside did last game lol`\Courtney Lee is priming right now.`\Hey hey heeeeey`\YOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO`\That's good to hear.

`\I mean...it was a bad call.`\Holy shit 3 straight fouls`\I will say otherwise, actually. Curry doesn't shoot over 50% from the top right.

It's kind of sad that you can't grasp the flow of conversation.

If Curry shoots from the opponent's freethrow line he's probably going to miss it. I don't hear you saying otherwise.`\Offensive foul?`\ty`\i've never been to taco bell`\Don't worry Spurs, we got you


Edit: the 2 seed`\That Stuckey/Ellis 3. Oh my god `\We're going to lose, nothing you can do about it.  `\Because we are that deep`\Because he's a novelty. He's a good player, don't get me wrong.

"Will they have enough depth?" Etc.

It almost seems stupid now.

OF COURSE they will be good when you replace Baynes and Tiago with LaMarcus and West. It shouldn't have been such a hard concept to understand. `\Number one /r/nba meme duo perhaps.`\Bless the souls of Kawhi and LMA. Literally carrying us so hard.

Who are the Spurs resting?`\Thanks :D`\That KD/Robes action was nice.`\These sorts of games should are made for Simmons, but his defense was so bad at the start of the game Pop didn't give him any minutes. Too bad he can't get a big role even when everybody's resting.`\These fucking spurs flop a lot...`\Lauren Holtkamp can do that to you. Seriously, why the fuck is she reffing?`\Naaa. Just ice and massages for him `\yeah the seafood department is no joke, even in the 'poor' area hebs`\Philosophy major unite!? And that's interesting. That's definitely a place you could go with it.

Edit: better words for wording`\Argh. Ugh. That guy. It's going to be torture listening to his voice for the next hour and a half.`\Dude gave up 11 mill to ball out on the bench. `\It's his eyes.`\Don't worry it's all just a ploy so they'll leave him unguarded in the WCF.

Game 1 he makes those shots and everyone just assumes he got hot for that one game. Game 2 he burns em again and now you're up 2-0. Warriors try to adapt for game 3, but struggle. Boom, up 3-0.

Then maybe they pull out some wins. But it's too late. You guys get that 4 and game over. `\I wanna see the Spurs win out and get 72 wins`\I believe in him much more than I did Anthony Bennett.`\I too would like to see some Myles Turner in the play offs`\Please explain how so far on the basketball court this year Bonner contributed more than Buter?`\Put in Kawhi and LMA.`\And may a flight of angels sing thee to thy front office job`\we dont have players assaulting team staff `\lol wtf did the spurs do to you`\i love how the soccer moms think our boys are angels who dont even swear`\who the fuck eats pasta with fries `\Boban has to be 100% on shot clock buzzer beaters`\Tell me Spurs...  do you bleed.`\Baiting Payne into the long 2s.

Thats a whole other thing cause of the playoffs. `\seriously can't wait till blake to come back`\Just like good looking women in San Antonio then`\bogut delly mills simmons? we dont have much else.`\Jesus christ y'all are gonna win 70 games.

Calm down.`\all the pacers between game promo things are so cringy...`\Fuck you - CP3`\Not even.  They're not tanking again next season.  They need to show they're a viable playoff team if they want to get a star in free agency next off season. `\Ok that makes a whole lot more sense.`\We are going to win this I believe `\Jesus, I feel dirty. Like shit man. `\Fuck this home cooking bullshit `\Oooooooooo`\what kind of bullshit call is that`\Was gonna take my dad to this game. Thankfully I didn't.

Watching it from home, especially once the bench gave back a massive lead at the start of the 2nd quarter, this game started to feel like the Knicks game last year. Just dreadful offense.

Special shoutout to Mills/Ginobili/Diaw/Green who combined to go 2-20 for 7pts. `\BOBAN TIME`\man the summer/winter time thing is screwing with my nba watching. an hour late again :< `\He's experiencing a Whiteside-like surge in Udrih's absence.  Always been good defensively, finally found a jumper to go with it.  `\I'm losing my mind. Idk why I thought you said overrated. `\I never get tired of the Hoopers commercials.`\V3RD3!!!!!`\Lmao `\Raptors, Warriors, and Thunder are the only games left we have at home to go perfect. Certainly possible. `\Duncan come on man box out!`\C'mon Patty. Let's see one go down.`\Welp`\he got the fssw 'play of the game' two games in a row.`\That's looking less and less likely with every 4th quarter`\That's not true I could see KD winning in San Antonio `\I just have zero confidence haha. Totally expecting a collapse`\they look like kids here. `\Go smaller. Instead of Monstars, we bring out the Alley Oompa Loompas! `\I always think of an alternate universe where we sign Gasol and go back to back. Would have fit in great here. `\we're missing Danny's threes`\Ya, saving Boban for when we really need him.`\HE'S BACK GUYS`\Look at the schedule. They beat who they are supposed to and lose to everyone else`\Kawhi with 29pts/7reb/2ast/2stl/2blk

LMA and TP with a double double

14 steals total`\> Stephen Curry: I'm coming home

ftfy`\ur my favorite warriors fan always cheering for us`\Patty "pressure" Mills`\I'm on mobile (family is using my laptop to watch the game) but I got it from /r/nbastreams. Used the VLC link. `\lol hows this even debatable. Hardens been running their PnRs even when during his okc days. Thats why people called for Westbrook to be traded over Harden because of better fit with KD.`\higher quality`\Back to back DPOY, LETS GO KAWHI!!`\"CP3 is invisible if Kawhi  is on him lmao"

Did you guys watch last years series?`\Lots of upsets this week…well mainly poor effort really `\For sure. They're definitely not bad, it's just a very different energy. I'm likely too used to listening to the hometown guys.`\You would really take Lillard over CP3??`\PATTY MELT MILLS!`\Dude I never post in the rockets sub lol `\entertainment in itself`\why?`\Agreed. This sub is chill and Pounding the Rock has okay stuff from time to time but by far the best and most in-depth Spurs analysis is on Spurstalk from select posters. It's usually just buried by the racism, homophobia, player fan bs, etc lol`\Anthony "High School Point Guard" Davis`\It is on kens5`\Sick joke bro`\In the next 5 years though`\He's so nimble for is size, and so skilled for his age. Dude is gonna take over that position in the next few seasons.`\So far he does, yeah. He needs to see one go down and get loose.`\BOBANN`\Austin Rivers loves the AT&T Center.`\These are easy shots, reliable shots going in and smart, tough defense stopping the Wolves.  It's a great look.`\Good thing my Rest day aligned with this game. This could be a sick game`\:(`\PogChamp`\agreed you guys shouldn't even go after him now`\It was a joke, we say Boban destroys all just because of his size.`\Yep. They offered George Hill for them to pick and trade`\Anybody remember 2014? A certain finals 3pt record held by a certain guy who played pretty good defense? It just escapes my mind what his name was.`\I would be too, but getting ready for the playoffs, resting our key players and being in a favorable playoff position are more important for us.  Don't forget we are old!`\Old man's got it`\The officiating on this game somehow manages to keep getting worse as this game progresses good lord`\In before you barely make the playoffs`\But...it was on ABC`\Well I mean we were the garbage man's Warriors. And Spurs just beat the actual Warriors. So...`\I'm excited to see how he plays. I haven't had the pleasure to yet this season.`\Get yo ulcers ready! `\Stay that way, fam. :)`\Kawhi Leonard is good.`\took an unexpected turn, that`\any other team would have just rolled over and given up. Props to Charlotte.`\Best case injury scenario, but still an injury that will lead to missed game time.`\WE GOT GOOD JEFF GREEN THIS QUARTER `\I don't think shes that pretty tbh`\Bizzaro Parker in the game. Not dribbling the air out of the ball and taking good shots`\LMAO AD guarded by danny green. still can't get the ball.`\you guys brought back our mojo....unfortunately, it brought the spurs trademark 3rd quarter meltdown with it.

nah, who am i kidding. they're outplaying us and we're not executing. bobo and tony will get shit straight for sure`\No excuse for that call.`\HOLY FUCK SIMMONS
`\Wow i would have thought it would be way higher than that. `\I really don't get what's Kawhi's game plan this game. Like, in the previous few games, he worked well with LMA and the rest of the team. This game, it seems that he's mostly standing around. Is that my imagination?

It doesn't seem like he's incorporated in the offence at all.`\prayers to Clips. hope it doesn't look like that Cavs game cuz booooring`\LINSANITY`\Ah, clearly the secret is to score only 7 points in the first quarter...*takes notes furiously to give to Kerr*`\Tony has been terrible.`\I think KMart gave whatever game he had left and gave it to Danny.`\He's good for about 16ppg and a knee surgery every summer league.`\lol, I wonder why they don't just say "bruise."

First time I heard the word "contusion," I thought someone's leg was gonna fall off.`\Incredible that a guy pretty much at the end of his career can still be such a force defensively.  He's slow and can't jump anymore, but he gets it done anyways through the sheer force of his fundamentals.`\I agree. All the charges Manu drew tonight really highlighted why he is above and beyond the other candidates. `\Why do you think I'm blaming them?

This is simply a question of what each player has accomplished and when you would take them in a fantasy draft given their respective careers.  Duncan has longevity that is only matched by one other player (Kareem).  That is a major factor here.`\Wait for real? His first game?`\YES! cant makes threes?! start dunking!`\This Grizzlies colour commentator is boring as fuck but he he's knowledgeable`\Got' em!`\How can you say that?`\Stupid sexy Redick`\MW either. Its so unfair`\Very high key hoping for this playoff matchup and for us to not have to play OKC`\Try again. There were in the bonus at the end`\lol cleaning up danny's trash, great work kawhi`\Yeah he tried doing on tht Mills 3 also`\We can't leave a 2 time champ open like that`\Ha fair enough, I wrote lead but I meant just choking late in general. `\and we wont today`\yike you can't give him that`\Yeah and hes also pretty tall`\Happy birthday Coyote!`\omg Lin is playing like it's ok we put his picture up everywhere`\The process must continue. That's why they're the best team but have worst record

Must get more lottery picks`\did you just copy & paste the comment before?`\you always get 20% off using visa20 tho, but that donation is nice`\That's not even the worst of it. Most of SA is wayyyy behind on music. The radio stations are pretty garbage.`\Before you say Danny is back realise that the spacing this game has been amazing for him and he's keeping back off the 3pt line which he makes. Confidence does wonders but realistically spacing does more to get the groove back.

When he's on or close the line he overshoots like a motherfucker. The spacing has been aweful this season for our 3pt shooters and Dannys effectivness is a direct correlation to that`\Do the Spurs need Andre Miller? Kevin Martin I can understand but why Miller. I'd much rather keep the Red Rocket, he's at the very least a 3 point shooter.`\Cut McCallum for him. We haven't made a cut for Martin yet`\wow, just wow`\Damn. Haven't even gotten a single free throw shot yet`\See you in the Finals, Charlotte.`\Every now and then he'll have an unusual night, but as an overall he's been playing the best basketball of his career the last 2 months. Had a nice string of 30+ games recently.`\Miss that blatant push in the back? Of course you did`\Kyle Anderson looks like Curry more.`\You played yourself `\Please no`\This is like watching a retard trying to pick on someone`\Plus he has to expend more energy being the 1a scorer on our team now.`\Oh wow.`\Yeah that shooting percentage took a big dip.

I think 52% to 27%`\I laughed....out loud.`\Indiana was different though. They started off so hot and then after trading Danny Granger- which I felt was a leader for them- they fell off considerably.

We weren't hot at the beginning of the year we've been doing well, but this stretch after all star break is not good. But good teams get through bad stretches. This is a tough stretch of a schedule we just finished and coming off a back to back last night.

I'm not brushing it off but I'm not freaking out. They're the players and the coaching staff. They have to get it together. I'm a fan at the end of the day I hope they do it all matters what we do in the playoffs. `\too meta i guess`\Acting? `\Lin better get ready for that Michael Jordan slap-ass`\This is eerily accurate.`\Went to a 15 minute meeting after the third quarter. Came back and it's a 20 point lead. The hell happened?`\Maybe ape shit is too strong but they  definitely play their best ball against the Spurs`\Thought he would get going after that jumper but nope, he just pulled a Danny Green without the defense...`\Sometimes I still can't believe he's on the Spurs.`\Boban with the haircut! `\much better than the game against u guise

that was...ugh`\Two I remember are Shook ones Part 2 and X Gon give it to ya.`\Bulls home win streak was 44 games.

44>43`\How does lillard do against screens usually? It seems like whenever I watch Portland he doesn't do well generally at fighting through screens. `\Haha, Paul making Mills slide because he lost a shoe.  That was hilarious.`\Wow, this is the best description I have ever heard.`\lel`\Ya, if we had Tolly and Stanimal we might have a healthy lead right now but you never know. Bullock has been good imo`\i must admit. i like these clippers announcers.

biiiiingo`\cool. Captain West lighting a fire for the team.`\Take yhe ball out of Austin and Jamal's hands and the offense changes for the better. Jamal was absolute trash again. `\bad jeff green`\Waiting for the playoffs it seems`\Can't expect to win on 35% shooting. `\I'm starting to think this Leonard guy might be pretty good...`\THE STREAK IS OVER IN NOLA. FLIP OF THE SWITCH IN the last 2 mins for the win. Happy day`\He put up 11 while still playing solid defense. That's as Spurs as it gets. `\Wild shots aren't necessarily a good thing. Source:Westbrook `\Diaw can't keep up with Morris `\Our defense looks horrid rn`\Damn Simmons has been cold as ice, not in a good way.`\These refs.`\I mean he has potential but if he's going to be a volume scorer that's not beneficial for him or his team. He needs to work on his shooting, defense and passing.`\Go Clippers!

I hate my life`\Because we don't play like this all the time`\lol no Ryan can't guard anyone`\He definitely is trying 100% he just isn't the type to externally show it `\Just imagine how good he'll be when he's 40!`\And we let him get away?! Damn. `\why are they goin for that 5?

is this a thing or something somebody hit me up pls.`\Well if Charlotte lost the 7 points from that quarter SAS should lose theirs too...`\Lionel Hollins was exposed so badly. I don't know any Grizz fan who thinks dropping him negatively impacted us. `\Fuck the Clippers.`\I fucking love our system player.`\TIMMEH! `\INTERCEPTION!`\Oh my god if Solomon hit that`\[Serge rates Boban two thumbs down](https://streamable.com/rkt2)`\Yes...Tayshaun.  I initially thought you meant Prince Prince.  Who, I guess, is a few years older than Tayshaun.  KG is also very, very old.  Does he ever play anymore :( ?`\I like how Ibaka keeps exponentially getting older.`\Bonner tha God `\Come on Kyle D:

Come on Danny D:`\She's incredibly successful so I'd say you're incorrect.`\Know them feels Spurs bros. On the bright side, thanks Pacers bros!`\[mrw Rasual plays 1 minute of garbage time](http://gfycat.com/ShinyNearGannet)`\have mercy`\oh shit what happened???

did the Spurs choke away the 3rd quarter??`\he stole it from bron bron`\6 minutes in the game left, and it is now mathematically impossible for Boban to finish with less points than minutes.


He's such a god`\AD can't catch a break, such a great player`\Fuck, I knew we were going to lose this game, but I'm still getting pissed watching us play.`\As shit as Danny has been from 3, he and and Kawhi did as good a job as any two defenders in the league could do at guarding Russ and KD. With both of them stepping up as elite defenders I no longer fear the Thunder like in the past.`\Yeah my bad. For some reason I thought they played Utah `\Letting go of CoJo still pisses me off, but it was clear that they expected him to be a 3rd string point guard. He would have signed a qualifying offer with another team that the Spurs would not have matched.

I am seriously pissed at them cutting Ray. `\Heat finna win`\What the heck dudes`\No foul on Tim? K.`\That was BEAUTIFUL DANNY`\tbh we really need that scoring at the beginning of the game, we've had problems mostly with the beginnings of games this year, this "energy off the bench" thing is a myth, we need Mills energy at the start lately.`\he hit 4 threes, 1 of them was pretty clutch`\this is why I love your fans. Not often someone loses and then writes a post like this afterwards. Its hard to dislike the spurs man I'll tell you what`\HAVE IT ALL`\LINSANITY IS BACK`\What year is it again?`\Woah that looked like it was off Monta`\I miss, Tyreke only guy who can carry the team other than AD.`\Can ya'll just promise me none of you will post this on pornhub? thanks.`\When I get lonely or bored, I do this too. Sometimes, I even re-run all of the 5 championship videos. Haha`\Reminds me of the 06 Heat team that had Wade, Shaq, Gary Payton, Alonzo Mourning, Jason Williams, and Antoine Walker.  That's 4 HoF players and two more all star-ish players.`\And another fucking whistle `\Calls seem a little one sided`\Kawaiiiiii`\Oh, that definitely makes it okay, then.

They screwed themselves out of like 4 points. Could have been like 42-45, instead of 38-49`\Every team complains about the refs, and most of the complaints are about the leagues inconsistency on what is and what is not a continuation. `\He's averaging 31% from 3, played in only 65% of the games. Not saying Bonner is doing anything but implying that Butler is contributing anything of not is absurd.`\Let's not overreact guys, slow down.`\I always find it funny that Kawhi is never sitting behind the bench with other DNP players when he is injured. `\kyle anderson needs to take those 3's`\But just imagine if it comes back for the playoffs. Oh god, what a sight that would be.`\Yeah, the guy above you said that.`\Good start `\just let it happen`\LOL`\It's nice when the 3's are falling`\That's the main reason I wasn't so hot on him in the draft.  Very little of his game works in a less athletic frame.`\We playing like ass`\Rest for the playoffs or get the perfect home record.`\Tell me about it.`\Thank baby Jesus for DVRs.`\Grudgingly upvoted`\WHO WHAT WHERE WHEN AND...KAWHI`\Also the WCF club`\Pathetic showing from us today. Soft as fuck.  `\And with this the Pacers hold the regular season crown.`\And I love it`\One of those nights I guess. `\They didn't say but he will need stitches.`\KAWHI`\Same here. I need to buy his jersey already`\I Missy Danny's threes.  :(`\Who is the poor unfortunate man stuck with Marv Albert tonight?`\Grandpa Miller!`\They have a 33% win percentage since the All-Star break. That's 12 games. It's not "losing a few games." This is a worrying trend. They've blown six fourth quarter leads in those 12 games *alone*.

The playoffs are an entirely different beast, but to brush this off as a meaningless two-game skid or something is silly.

We saw this happen with Indiana two seasons ago. Nothing about their play in this second half of the season has been inspiring in any way.`\Duncan is just ridiculous man. His defense in the last 2 minutes was picture perfect. Never out of position and never leaves his feet. `\if anything it's us you have to ask to stop the Warriors`\Pretty damn sketchy right there`\Yeah idk what happened honestly, I was cooking through most of it since it was such an early game. Sounds like we just choked it away haha`\Not one shot yet. Hope him and Miller get some time these next few games.`\We are �� rn`\He was pretty amazing for a third string PG who played great defense and had on point passing. `\LOL ^`\Went ahead and upvoted some posts to negate the one or two salty Spurs fans`\Are you new to Reddit? That's how it goes here. You just have to wait it out, my friend. `\How in the fuck is that not a foul on Duncan on one end but Indiana gets the foul on the other?`\Haha nah. Watched a lot of snl in the mike myers days.`\Bro the game wasn't even over when you posted this `\Freddy?`\Spurs could play me and four middle schoolers and we'd still shoot 65% against the Grizzlies.`\nobody's going to want to face this hornets team come playoff time`\Amazing awareness from Miller`\Timmy just killin' it with the blocks today.`\There is now.`\JJ redick damn`\I ~~want~~ need LMA to score 40.`\Can I get a video of that Pop interview in the third quarter? That shit was pretty funny.`\He has. Last match up against the clippers, parker was exposed at every play. This game not so much because patty has been taking his minutes`\It was beautiful`\first time I've seen this. love it`\Fuck the pelicans `\Guys it's been one fucking quarter. We've had bad first quarters all season long. Wait until the fourth to make any judgments. We're still gonna win this one I'm certain. `\America is doomed.`\"you the police?"`\Is that really working out for Westbrook and Durant? `\Right? Like c'mon man you've been watching these guys play every game for the past 7 seasons`\Yeah. Maybe starting with Patty will help alleviate that.`\Pistons, take my energy `\Parker, sit your ass down.`\Hard, if you can't handle this little rough patch, how are you gonna go if KD happens to leave? `\No need for the question mark. `\We played the kings. I love Bonner, but he is not contributing anything significant against OKC or the Warriors come playoff time. `\HAHA another Andre Miller being young joke! Never seen that one before!`\They don't need to be in the playoffs,  they need to finish close and show promise that a star could pull them into contention.  `\Great feed by Anderson right there. LMA had good position and he recognized `\Jeremy Lin is literally Pop's Pop. Or he popped Pop whichever you prefer.`\Yes it was?`\Just hilarious `\great D from both teams, that was intense`\Boban held his own out there today.`\Omg. They took away the 2pts.`\Swag is no longer with us though, you better not let us down Tobias, we've got high expectations `\The hell are the Spurs doing?

I turned the game on and they were up by like 20, and then I started playing Guitar Hero. By the time I looked back at the game, they were only up by 5`\Well we only have two starters and backups hurt, so yeah we're trash. `\It looked like a bad call at first but the replay looked janky`\Get everyone off that floor holy shit`\Mm tasty Dunleavy. Served with a special deep red and black sauce with notes of tangerine, raspberry and vanilla.

I swear that shit was farther down his forehead last game.`\rockin dat nas is like`\TIMVP`\For someone who lives in Houston and gets back-to-back national games, oh boyyyy it's nice.

But damn, it was like to different teams 1-3 and the 4th.

Clippers might just take that 3 seed.`\Why don't they start Jrue???`\Got it!

LaSharkus`\Personally, I just feel bad for you guys in general. It's hard to take your team to the next level when constant injuries are stopping you from fully gauging your team's current level. `\Are you kidding me? You wanna make GSW MORE of a contender?`\I can't play it for shit tho. I either hesitate too much and miss the ball, or I commit too much and miss the ball.`\Seriously, the Clips can be a scary team. Please don't meet us in the playoffs. `\^:(`\What's my mothafuckin name? `\That was the softest foul call I've seen in a while`\We're playing better, I like this line up quite a bit.

THEY NEVER EVER QUIT`\Really?? Doris Burke actually strikes me as being pretty knowledgeable.`\Excited to watch Kemba play tonight. I absolutely love his scoring ability. `\Too many Spurs fans still wearing their rose-tinted glasses when it comes to him and Ginobili. They can honestly play like complete fucking garbage for 10 games straight but the have one good game and the fanboys scream "where are the haters now?" "Vintage Gino/Parker". Pretty sad.`\Real talk, I actually really like the Grizz. Especially the combo of Conley and Gasol. It hurts to see a team so sidelined by injuries`\OH NOES`\Go Spurs Go`\Victoria *is* a secret though. `\Am I reading this right?`\I can't believe Utah is letting you guys make the playoffs `\WTF?? the spurs are fucking old`\I saw him fistbump a spurs fan before the game. pretty sure that means he belongs to us now `\Something lacking in our wing defense this game.

`\The Grizzlies scoring 104 pts without their best players. Goes to show you how much of the defensive is Kawah and Danny. `\Fucking money red mamba`\Pick and roll, penetration, kick out, swing ball around for open 3.

Only really works with Manu in. `\As long as the other phases are in the regular season I'm good`\oh god`\I swear Chris Paul's shooting percentage against the Spurs all time must be around 80%.`\Man you're pessimistic.`\DAGGGERRRRRR BY SLOWMO`\I would take KD/RW and Curry and one of Dray/Klay over them`\Gosh, I just really wish Mills would start already. Parker is disappointing, and I don't enjoy watching him play with the starters, the ball really sticks with him. I don't think that's ever going to happen. Unfortunately, I think Parker will retire a starter too :( he said he wanted to retire at 38.`\But it is on Derrick. You don't have to listen to the coach when it's not working. See: Russell Westbrook, Kevin Durant, Lebron James.`\Do it to em Al`\Can the Spurs still catch the Warriors?`\Boban vs Baynes!!! My head is about to explode!!!`\Everyone wants to give up the mid range so we signed all the guys that shoot the mid range efficiently`\Outscored 28 to 7 in the first quarter and still won. Damn.`\Transition defense?? What's that?`\I bet $240 on the Spurs. My biggest bet ever.  I entered $25 bucks and made my way up to $315 during March Madness.  Today, of course the one day without March Madness I bet on NBA.  Only reason I bet so much is cause it yielded a lot.  Bet big Win Big.   I stopped caring after 28-7 tonight thinking there's absolutely no way in hell this happens to me and the Spurs lose.  The rest is pretty much history & I have to go to work tomorrow.`\What do you have against John Galt?`\PLAYOFFS LOCKED!`\Paul Gaso`\Dude, don't discount Danny's defense. He lost his shot, but he's trying to make up for it on the other end of the court.`\Lin with 4-4 three point shooting.`\Oops. I thought you said Robes. My bad.`\http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-ubos2UajsgU/Vkpx6c7C0hI/AAAAAAAAJ70/m1Kro-kPBvI/s640/streaking.jpg`\GR333N`\Seriously. They're getting to be as bad as the Thunder.

Fuck you Thunder, you can suck my dick!`\His defense is killin' it, though.`\They're just mad our owner is the GOAT.

Parker just doesn't have it anymore. He has a difficult time running the offense with LMA and Kawhi. His routine is basically, dribble for 15 seconds while surveying the court then forces either a contested mid range jumper or when he gets stuck passes too late or has a turnover. They need to run the offense through LMA and Kawhi, notice how they get doubled in the post. Mills is great for spacing. `\I wonder if Paul George is still mad the Spurs traded him for Kawhi Leonard. `\Well it would be in a trade for Kawhi of course`\Take that scrub down to the post Perk!`\He was great for us last season, we probably wouldn't have made the playoffs without him. `\Duncan flashing the quick gang sign `\Kawhi is goin to feast on Dunlevy.`\Jlin feeling that palo alto blood come alive tonight!`\About another 2 million years I think`\This game man`\Yeah, personal attack with no substantial proof will get you somewhere. `\It really will come down to the last couple games, because 2 of the Dubs' final 4 games are against the Spurs`\Yes`\LINVP`\Miller is honestly the best facilitator at his position.

https://twitter.com/AirlessJordan/status/705227720527990785`\Yup, was gonna say that before I saw your comment. Steph's dad pitched in 19 off the bench too.`\if u let me on the team i'll practice real hard too.`\Pretty much everyone on the team is reliable in some way.`\41 Straight!

S.P.A.M`\Nah I'm sure danny green already built a wall with all his bricks `\Gentry is ass cheeks. `\He was shooting great in January and most of February. As long as he has the potential to be a good three point shooter, defenders will still respect him. He is like the fifth option among our starters so his offense is not super important.

Also, he hasn't seemed completely inept at driving recently.`\How the fuck does a team (the Spurs of all teams) score 5 points in a quarter.`\HACK-MBAH`\40 straight home wins. The matchup against OKC is scaring me a bit. `\What the fuck is up with our three point shot jesus`\He's not calling timeouts, he's putting bad lineups out there, and he generally seems to have no control over the game, especially in late game situations. Russ and KD aren't going to make comments about the guy, but they're playing worse and worse as time goes by and it's pretty clear there is growing friction somewhere. Russ is playing frustrated EVERY night, and it shows in his turnovers, stupid plays, and poor shooting (also his over reliance on the 3 when he sucks at it)

Regardless of how the team is performing, the coach is always responsible, when our problem is players making the same fucking mistakes over and over again it's very clear that the coach isn't doing a good job at all. He needs to let Westbrook cool his head off when he's running wild, but today he went SEVEN FUCKING MINUTES in the 4th without calling a timeout, meanwhile we lost the game on some stupid plays and bad matchups. He finally called time in the final minute of the game and we had 3 timeouts left that he burned to try to make up an 8 point deficit.


Also, have you seen our defense? It's no wonder Russ gambles so much now, the Spurs passed like 5 times in a possession while hardly moving and our entire team was absolutely SCRAMBLING to keep up because of all the switches and retarded shit. We somehow managed to stick with them, but there is no reason at all why we should've had to work that hard just for a single stop. `\On Halloween.`\Random question: is this gif from a movie? `\the warriors inspiration. `\> kenny

I feel like we could get some better defensive results.  `\Like who is gonna go to the lakers next year? KD?`\Klay is pretty close to LMA in terms of talent. It just depends on what you value more and what your team needs.`\No one is going to try to find you Reggie`\AD: 0 championships.

`\That was a foul though, how does a PF go up at the rim against two guards and miss that.

what is this?!`\Offensive interference wtf refs`\i think it's 12 after today lol`\We managed to get past New Orleans, I feel like we'll still get past this game.

New question is why he hasn't just been doing that whenever his 3 ball isn't falling? `\Ok, I'm scared.`\LOL - Rockets, too`\Travel`\Yea I agree. It was one of the biggest win-wins I've ever seen. Both teams got exactly what they needed.`\Dude the spurs has a dude who turned down 11 million dollars on their bench!`\Simmons? I think he's hurt.`\Draymond is better than Kawhi imo`\Frank's face after getting yelled at by the ref! lmao`\Cp3 ran into Duncan and tried to get a call. Pathetic `\Nobody can beat Joey Crawford. She comes close...but nobody..can..beat..Crawford.`\Username really doesn't check out in this case.`\I feel like LMA enjoys the other guys resting `\> In 1-2 years, Kawhi could (and likely will) be even more of a monster than he is already is

I wouldn't mind this`\Back that ass up, Diaw.`\its only 15..`\Knew we had it in the bag when OKC  went into the 4th with a lead.`\Spurs playing interesting defensive strategy. Lots of switches happening. Overall, I'd say it's working okay, since either Kawhi or Green is switching onto Paul.

Parker worries me. I'd like to see how Mills handles CP3.`\Boban vs Baynes, make it happen Pop.`\well, you're not wrong`\I disagree mainly because the league has been so inconsistent with continuation calls for the past 2 years. `\Nah fuck that, LeBron has at least been a top 5 player for the past decade+, the Warriors win one championship, have a great season, and suddenly everything they touch is gold. Fuck that. `\Good to see Stuckey back and playing well`\Danny redeemed himself there `\I didnt start watching until the end of the third and I am already pissed.`\I'd say it's still his court vision.`\Whew dagger`\Derrick hasn't done bad on Kawhi though`\Remember when third quarters were the worst part of Spurs games?`\I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO WITH MY HANDS`\Boban the mid-range shooter?!!!!`\I don't see why he doesn't get more minutes!`\LMA looks so comfortable now, I love it.`\Has he been playing like that all season? I remember he used to tear up the Spurs when we played y'all in the playoffs.`\Time for Patty Thrills`\Always check /r/nbastreams `\I still think he will be fine once he gets some good coaching.`\a taste of their own medicine eh`\That was a quick 3 seconds...`\neat`\which doesn't bode well for us since Pop usually starts resting players at that point. ugh.`\I almost wonder if people watch games or are capable of changing their initial impressions on a player.`\1 more point KD`\That was a clean block tho`\That's a possibility too.  I'd prefer a buyout.  If Conley walks in free agency it's a possibility but I still wouldn't bank on it`\lol what is parker doing`\GO EH-SPOORS GO`\smh thats a fucking charge.`\Do you not remember when Duncan literally smacked Drummond's wrists on a layup attempt and how they called a foul on KCP when Parker ran into Duncan?

Legends and superstars get away with a lot in the league. Especially at home.

Pop's philosophy helps out too, but don't act like the officiating isn't usually on your side against teams like us. `\Spurs d is so fuckin good`\West ALWAYS brings it!!`\Having more cushion for the pushin really eases the stress on the  players joints. You only got so many jumps and you only got so many humps`\Wait.... What?!?`\I'm convinced its because you only eat them when you're drunk. Its a goddam hot dog`\Pelicans what are you doing`\I mean, that's just as good, technically.`\To be fair, Stanley is out, and he checked Leonard while he was in the game, but you are mostly right, it was probably mostly a bad game from Kawai. `\Kawhi please take over all playoffs`\The dark years. I think he also screwed up Manu's rotation too, because I remember him just going insane after Pop got ejected and got us super close then kinda didn't play the 4th too??`\LINNNN!!`\Thank you, bro!

Definitely the better defender and he's way more explosive than Parker. The problem is on offense. He can't do what TP can do on offense.  But he does look very comfortable playing with the starters whenever he gets the opportunity, he almost never turns the ball over (1.6 TO/36) which is perfect for our style of play and he can spot up and create his own shot.  `\Oh fuck no please`\Having only watched the past 3 minutes, has the reffing been bad against the Spurs and now switched to being bad against the Pacers?`\Keep in mind, our organization cares more about their fans than Pop. `\Plus a chance at a ring at his home.`\oh god, those were terrible years to watch.`\He really does.

In special cases, being exceptional in one aspect can still make you better than some who is good all around. Of course, Curry isn't entirely Rock Lee; he's much more than just a shooter. But his unbelievable shooting makes him better than Westbrook even though Brodie is a triple double machine.

Though, I'll admit that Westbrook would be better if his BBall IQ was higher. Too many boneheaded mistakes to be better than Steph. `\He's significantly better than he was a year ago. He's really long, has a solid build, has quick hands, and is generally quite smart on the court.

But he's exceptionally slow, so he's limited. But he's a net positive at this point.

Kawhi is significantly better, obviously. `\Man... Wish he'd have come to us. Would've been a solid backup for Kawhi. `\No overreaction but the Pels are the 2nd best team in the nba. `\He has been absolutely unreal these past couple of months now that he's completely integrated into the system and the other players have figured out where he's most effective with the ball`\LAChokers`\Yeah. I think the only problem is that he sometimes over commits and gets burned. Especially on Curry, that's a recipe for some highlight plays.

However, I think 110% all the time on Curry is the only way, regardless of whether you get burned or not. Hopefully we see how that mini match up plays out sometime. `\Yeah.  It's him danny lamarcus and kawhi`\Spurs are fucking unbeatable. How did the Warriors even blow them out?`\lol only down by 4 by starting our bench. `\I think we get it, spurs have been amazing and pistons have been shit since 05`\Ouch Kawhi 1/7 from 3PT land, most have been open looks.`\God damn it some called this guy an amberlamps!`\By the same rules from that Indiana game it should have been a continuation. `\david west da god`\81 points with five minutes left in the 4th is not apeshit...`\Same boat man :( needed the spurs to pull through on this one.`\LMA is fucking automatic in the mid range.

I'm just gonna forget this game ever happened. `\Shocker... The Spurs lose to a team slightly above .500 lol... The last L was the Clippers...

I'm just going to stop watching spurs games this season. `\Picked up 2 fouls.`\Tony Parker sucks. People didn't notice because the Spurs were on an 8 game win streak.

I hate that call tho `\tbf, with Lebron and just Lebron I think you're guaranteed a playoff spot.`\What a retarded pass by Manu.`\I wouldn't phrase it like that, he's just playing like it's 2012-2013 again and he's the head of the snake. Like he's not playing badddd, he's just not playing well or based off the cast around him`\Lol!`\Get Enrique Porker out of the game ffs`\Because, lately, they've been focusing defensively on starter PGs that influence the offense in a great way, not backups. The last victim was Kemba. They didn't count with Linsanity entering the zone. `\Oh yeah, I forgot everyone loved the Clips before that.

People try to justify "hating" the Clips when they're mostly just cashing in for karma.`\Often. `\For Spurs fans, I see that Kyle Anderson is assigned to defend Kevin Durant. How effective is Anderson is a defender? If the starters were in, would we see Anderson attempt to defend Durant, or would Kawhi dominate that match-up.

If the Clips win then our conference lead over Spurs grows, but if the clips win then the clips win. Tough one but Go Spurs Go! `\Lmao Russ `\Fun fact: if I played with bballref's game finder correctly, looks like Boban's 8 boards with 0 pts, ast, blks, stls, tov, pf is tied for 3rd highest all time.`\It downloaded a vlc program and.. no it did not work.`\��`\Not really, he played 8 minutes and they are only down 1`\And last night.`\Spurs got a few all stars on their bench compared to nepotism `\Couple years ago green and party were automatic when open`\Just bc he deserves a little recognition, I think Manu was a great spark at the end of the 3rd beginning of the 4th. He was in Durant's jersey for the 5 possessions he defended him in that span. Really felt like a "we're not gonna lay down and lose" statement. Maybe a small thing, but one that is invaluable in role players.

On that note, I think the difference between the Spurs before and after the All-Star break, is the clear delineation of Kawhi & Alrdridge as the forefront of the team, and everybody else playing the part of supporting cast. Each of the big three play major roles, but not much (or at all) bigger than Boris or Patty Mills. It's truly amazing to watch an NBA team transfer to new stars while the old stars are still getting major playing time. It happens in the other major sports, but typical NBA stars go out shooting.`\*unzips*`\Not alot you can do when a teams 6th man goes for 29/7/3`\Tied late in the 3rd and the Spurs *still* almost get another 25 point win`\I'm the other way.

It's just that when they get too close the Spurs make a 3 or an easy bucket`\...of course it has to be the Nets :(`\Let's keep pump faking open shots just to turn it over`\Was that the first time this season that a team overcame a huge deficit vs the Spurs?`\Too far up, he only likes the corner and only if necessary, mostly`\What a goon, that Tim Duncan`\I feel the same way, except for the last part.`\as fucked up as it is to say this... im glad he tore his rotator cuff after 2014. we were able to keep him at ~3m when he wouldve gotten cory money from someone else if he hadnt been injured. `\Andre Miller plays for the Spurs now? Must've brought the Twolves average age down 20-30 years.`\Can we just agree they've fucked both teams tonight and move past it?`\I hope those misses don't go to Simmons' head.  He's been struggling recently.`\Rose dropped 21/3/6 with Kawhi fucking Leonard guarding him - I think it's safe to say he's back.`\It was an early game for the dubs. That changes a lot.`\We haven't been playing like a playoff team the past week. Outside of the second half of the Heat game.`\Story of Danny Green's year.  Bricks the open 3 but single handedly stops the Linsanity fast break.`\Too hot in Texas`\You know Boban is so drunk. He's gonna hit up the OKC clubs tonight just like Harden used to. `\Fuck 32-13 3rd qtr, cmon heat..`\Good fucking game`\Spurs have been killing it with the instrumentals tonight.

Just played Day N'Night `\I do too.`\Leonard is feeling it.`\They're not too bad tonight.`\Idk, it's unusual.

Why do you care? Spurs are resting players it was going to be an L anyways `\Eesh, i need a replay of that foul`\[Still looking...](https://m.popkey.co/cedcc1/eLw7m.gif)`\Yeah I kinda would've preferred to see the foul`\There are days where I love Tony Parker, and then there's games like today where I want to cut him on the spot. `\the fact that a 39 year old man can protect the rim that well is unfathomable`\Our defense is way better now than in the 00s. Kawhi is a much better defender than Bowen, and LMA is light years ahead of anyone we've had at the 5 since David. `\Count that bucket, fam. ��`\Spurs were going for a 95-95 Bulls, but today they pulled off a '15-16 Bulls.`\I am sort of rooting for the Clippers in this one and it's painful. So much Green, Rivers, and Prigioni...`\Patty too fast for his own shoes.`\Come on Tobias you gave kawhi so much space `\Andre Miller in a Spurs uniform. Still weird.`\Really put OKC in their place with this one. We are the Champs of choking away leads, and don't you forget it. `\Yeah no worries. I have had hope all season that he will show up when the spurs need him most(the playoffs/WCF) and he has had his share of showings on offensive prowess this regular seaon. Between he and Kawhi the impact to the floor on the defensive end is quite amazing.`\I mean as of now its a baseless accusation that needs proof.

It's just that if you have a 24 year old who can gain generational wealth by claiming to be 19 you forge those documents every time.`\trade danny for bum off the street`\Tims like "damn I gotta jump"`\Moving screen city `\Yup just its weekly occurrence.`\Singler has some good games sometimes  and plays solid defense, but recently his FG% is just atrocious and that hurts a lot. Foye's better than DJ I guess? That's not really saying all too much. He's not all that terrible but I honestly haven't been paying too much attention to him. I do feel like he's getting too many minutes for his limited production, though. I guess if I say anything about the bench it's that they're at best middling, but that just doesn't hold up against teams like the Spurs and Golden State (and to a lesser extent the Clippers) who just have stronger benches. Staggering helps a lot, of course, and Donovan's been experimenting a lot more with staggering WB and KD's minutes lately. However, it still seems like Donovan's really hesitant to make switches and this means that the wrong pieces are in the court sometimes. I feel like this is where those assistants really matter.

KD and Westbrook are really playing really sloppily in the 4th quarter, though. They're getting so many more turnovers then. Westbrook's making ill-advised shots and KD's just getting the ball stolen, they gamble too much, etc. There's a lot of "heroball" going on, especially from Westbrook. As for Ibaka, I don't know. He's playing good defense as usual, but his shooting touch is a bit iffy compared to previous years. This has been true all season though.`\He killed it. That shit was super impressive`\u sound stupid as hell.`\Pels fans are the least represented on /r/nba iirc`\Yeah, sure. Appoint reddit users as the connoisseur on judging someone entirely. Great. `\TBH unless they won a championshp/make the finals again, we probably won't be talking about this thunder team in 30 years`\Nice one, Hill.`\Hornets will not go quietly into the night.

Hornets will not vanish without a fight!

`\Would really like to see 2 quick fouls on DJ`\Imagine Lin is with the spurs coming off the bench.`\My first ever NBA game. I've been a spurs fan forever but I never lived in a basketball city until recently. I can tell you that the excitement really heated up in the second half. Even though we lost, I can say that this was a great first game to watch live. `\Of course that's Manus first pass and shot of the game `\Bed post?`\Lol yeah, but his defensive skills have been showing lately. `\Little worried about Manu right now.  After that great return game, his shot has seemed way off.`\JJ YOURE NOT THAT GOOD`\Spurs putting Kawhi on Chris Paul toward the end of the half really started to disrupt their offense. They weren't getting nearly as many easy dunks and layups as they did early on. Still a great performance from CP3; he was the only reason they were in this game.

The biggest problem for the Clips is that their bench just got completely destroyed whenever they were on the floor (particularly in the 4th quarter when the Spurs made their big run). Clippers bench got outscored 42-12 before Doc pulled Paul late in the 4th and basically conceded the game. Clips would have the game tied, then the bench would come in and they'd be down 7-9 at the time of the next rotations.

Big game from Patty Mills. I was also surprised the Spurs didn't post up LMA or Duncan more to start the game. The Clippers are basically forced into small ball all the time with Blake out and Mbah a Moute can't really guard either of them.`\Oh man that nola pelican silhouette is money. Such a good design `\We will lay an egg vs Charlotte, coming off a big win vs GS.`\Wormy!`\Man that was really fun to watch but it makes me sad to see Kemba so cold :(`\Its so nice to see Charolette pack the the place`\Spurs watches the tape and determines that the only way to beat lin is to acquire him next season.

They won't. `\Every time I watch Hornets I come away puzzled with their coaching. Somehow Lin is always balling, hustles a lot and makes good decisions, but is not given a larger role. I watched the previous game and he was just beautiful and smooth, but Batum and Co kept chucking and creating mimi-iso situations. It's either Lin doesn't command enough respect from the crew or coach doesn't allow him too much to manage. Too bad, I really hope dude finds his team one day, he really shines as a playmaker.`\Nah `\That's weak man. Super weak`\Its Manu time`\MONTE HAVE IT ALL`\This Curry dude is a scrub`\Yeah, injuries can be a dick sometimes.`\Martin getting some playing time?`\Yes, fuck us :)`\They keep saying Gibson and I always think it's Boozer. What happened to him? And Tibs? And Noah and Butler?`\I've given up on the season and I'm bank on this now. I still want him to shoot in hopes that he'll just come out the other side, but I'm not expecting much until postseason.`\Day before yesterday, I think i saw it on /r/nbaspurs (couldn't find it rn), someone was talking about how Mills should start (pretty common talk) and another guy responded "2(3?) more years left in his contract...", to which a more reasonable person answered that unless he retires, Tony will never leave/be traded.`\Excited for the marquee matchup at point guard.

I reffed a couple HS games and block vs charge was super difficult to call and if a guy is driving and two people fall down you basically have to call something.

You are saying he's perfect coming in the way he does, but it is not allowing him to play anywhere close to his potential.

It's like he just does a really high chest pass to the rim.`\Time to slim down the playoff roster`\I see it as a quarter of 100`\I guess chasing Steph around all night *does* make a team tired.`\Boban for 40!!!`\That was such good D by PG too...`\Let's go hornets, clap, clap, clapclapclap`\I've said that but with the express caveat that they can't beat contenders away from the AT&T Center. I'll be very pleased when the Spurs start proving me wrong.`\I think they depend on Kemba and Batum putting up big numbers. `\Yes I've watched every game. I said jumpers that were short aka missed. I want them to go IN.`\Curry come home!`\Instead of fucking ppl up and blazing past them, he forces his defender to work at a pace thats awkwardly slow but comfortable for him. `\DAMN DANIEL`\#GoSpursGo `\WTF,  bad refs following our team ffs.
`\It's almost like Steve is doing the absolute bare minimum to remain on the team. Right when I reach my peak anger at him he will do something good`\Damn I thought this Richardson guy was just a shooter. But he looks like he could be a Middleton type?`\20 fucking turnovers but a W is a W.

[Good night sweet prince.](http://celeb-true.com/images/matt-bonner/matt-bonner-05.jpg)`\Scoring only 7 points in the first quarter was to summon Lin.`\Nah, you forgetting the great swaggy P and his sidekick Bean`\It must be the rim on that one side of the court.

The only possible explanation.`\Harlem Shake in 2016? Spurs, you disappoint me.`\Best one of the three so far for sure. Darrell was just creepy. `\great team basketball.`\I had to plan this months in advance haha. I'm the second row from the back. I'm getting vertigo up here lol`\Looks like they decided to call some fouls on the Bulls`\Hah`\Danny Green sucks monkey balls`\Aldridge has been so much better over the last few months than the first few. Took him a while to get settled, but he seems to be in his groove now. `\Nice 20 games behind us, bro.`\"[Danny] Green is not really a defensive player"

Holy shit these Pacers announcers...`\"The fuck did he just say?" -Pop`\It's not that surprising, we always play to our opponents level.`\Great ball movement until the TP TO...`\what is Danny doing going into the paint?!!!

that was beautiful!`\I can't wait to see the postgame review.`\Idk why it's still taking me this long to not still think of them as the Bobcats`\So tired of Kawhi passing up open shots`\Yup. 4 pt swing right there.`\Whiteside made some mistakes, some ugly faces. But I don't think he's on that train now.

I mean, he has been playing really well. He's coming from the bench, he's not complaining. He's solid.

His personality is a little (my English starts to fail) over the top (?). It's better for him if he has a bad night once in a while because he seems to learn from his mistakes.

And... ~~*por lo menos Manu no hizo 50 puntos y no lo tuve que cagar a puteadas.*~~`\https://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:5y-cESbzJecJ:https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/49p2zw/is_serge_ibaka_actually_way_older_than_his_listed

No evidence or anything, just speculation.`\He was invisible against the Warriors. Draymond made him his bitch. `\Time to bring the bench out. Oh wait, they're already out.`\HYYYYYYPE!!!!`\I just love our whole team. Kawhi, Aldridge, everybody, and now Miller.`\Didn't we also get Jamychael green from yall? Spurs pickups seem to work out for us.`\Patty is going to be the key `\I don't often say this, but horrible defense by Kawhi.`\Aron Baynes/Steve Blake`\teaching 2nd grade in /r/nba? immpressive.`\Don't worry spurs fans, we are fantastic at giving up leads`\Never bet after the first quarter. I am so stupid.`\Respect for Bonner...we always hear about players struggling because they can't get in rhythm, dude warms the bench for 3 quarters and comes in and hits a three, has done it a couple of times now. `\A bail out call. Martin was gonna miss an easy layup`\I wish I had hands big as Leonard.`\I fuckin love our bench `\And moved on the screen. And if the refs are gonna call an illegal screen on Baynes when he didn't move, then that is certainly a foul. `\Looks like it's not going to count. Jesus.`\Danny Green better in the paint than from the three point line.

*cue Illuminati music*`\such shit`\I don't see it that way, I love Matty, have his autograph, he's awesome. But I know that Buttler may contribute more on a deep playoff run than Matt at this point.

Being able to throw 15 bodies out against the West is a big deal, if one of our wings is struggling you can plug in another.

Wish we had a way to keep both, we are incredibly spoiled that we have such a big discussion about cutting the last man on our team...`\This is our winning line up right here.`\http://i.imgur.com/1F4QL1x.gif`\It's kind of how I feel about Danny. `\Was in 7th grade in 99.... But I remember some of your glory for you if that makes you feel better`\[maybe](https://youtu.be/OrqJ2fJQGkg?t=2m8s)`\Man, Mills just ran straight into Adams and drew a foul somehow a minute ago.`\Lol, we'll see, buddy. Because Kanter fucks GS up. I think the bench is having a bad night more than anything.`\This is gonna be one of those games where everyone says the refs gave us the game if we win. I can tell.`\Idk. He crushed that wide open dunk.`\Honestly I have no clue.`\Tim Duncan? I think he's always been on the Spurs.`\....that's fat? Maybe I need to get out of SA but she looks good. `\You hate Curry, I hate BronBron. To each his own, I guess. `\It gets said for a lot of guys but Patty Mills is the ultimate glue guy. `\We get torn apart in third quarters. Elite teams make critical adjustments and it takes our young guys a whole quarter to figure that out. GG Spurs.`\No not really. The majority of the focus is on the present and then how I believe philosophy can improve education. What history I am covering is its advent in America, which at least according to a few sources has its root in the 1800s revivals where much of the church stopped valuing their intellectuals of the past but became much more about emotion.

Although it's funny you say that. I was watching a documentary about the rise of the Fascists and Nazis in Italy, Germany, and Spain last night. `\AND ONE`\"I gotta do more of that to be a superstar"

You're already a superstar Kawhi `\You know he coulda been talking about Kobe`\yup`\When I get lonely or bored, I do this too. Sometimes, I even re-run all of the 5 championship videos. Haha

`\yes i can see it`\West top of the key is so fuckin' money`\29 points, 4/4 from 3 pts, and a win > 14 points, 1/12 from 3 pts, and a loss. Checks out. Sorry Warriors but if you want to trade for Lin you'll have to give us Klay and Steph`\I'm not sure what Rick Ross has to do with this. Shout out to all the pears`\Our bench is lighting it up`\Kenny with no regard for OKC life`\GL making the playoffs bro. `\LMA is such an awkward player, especially when he runs`\For sure. He was brought in to take that MKG role of checking the best perimeter player on the other team and has filled it nicely. I hope we can get a deal done to keep him after this season.`\Duncan has been rocking Derelicte for years. `\Those aren't valid excuses. The Rockets were solid last year and a 7 game series is just part of the game. I don't understand people trying to undersell the Warriors. I'm a diehard Spurs fan but, damn, give Golden State its due.`\I accidentally The Boban`\Im still confused as hell as to why they signed him to that deal. `\Except we'd face the Clippers in the 2nd round so that right there is a series win by default.`\This is the lineup that will beat the Warriors. Bonner as 6th man.`\Na man Lin being in slump is him powering up DBZ style`\It's like fighting a woman.`\You guys are worse. And that's saying something.`\Shaqtin a fool!!!!`\That Kawhi to Patty 3 pass was so butter. Seeing LMA turn it up and getting all those midrange shots like an automatic machine was amazing.`\Westbrook lol`\I would love for Kawhi to take this as a game to blow up offensively. He's got a good match up to exploit, but Chicago is good enough where he still might get to play all 4 quarters. `\I'm a bit surprised how dead this thread it, since it's a national game.`\KYLE CALL A FUCKING TIMEOUT`\I'd have so many heart attacks that i'd have less hair than manu...`\Well, this is embarrassing.`\Holy fucking shit just catch and shoot Danny`\Depends. I'm a simple man and witnessed all of the championships. I'm OK with this loss. I'm happy for what I got. `\I'm sure SA fans love him. I'm rooting Clips tonight because I want the Warriors to win 73 and having the Spurs home court streak broken before GSW goes in would make it easier, I think.`\LOL PELS`\Yup its a sad day`\Lol! That's one theory. Nah bad reffing happens sometimes. Usually it evens itself out though. `\Cmon Diaw`\Man I'm so happy for Reggie Bullock. Stayed ready and taking his chances`\Boban hasn't forgotten that elbow from Whiteside.`\I vote the city of Austin for their taco game`\Should Manu bic his head?`\MA GAWD DAT DUNK`\Nope. No one is making shots `\aldridge is bricking everything too. not much better`\KMART`\we're down 1 point. Relax.`\You honestly think you can beat OKC or GS lol that's totally delusional `\That sign doesn't say cooking with Timmy`\Kawhi on CP3 was huge.`\give me the #1 with cheese plz`\Anybody use Fox Sports: Go? That app is trash. It skips and lags every few seconds, guaranteed.`\i want to see Lin win but I also want the Spurs to win!!!!`\Unlike most games, it really was our starters carrying us the whole way. Not a great night for the bench outside of Patty tbh.`\Mofuckas never luhd us

Remember? `\You're joking right? There's a zero percent chance that we cut Miller after two games.`\Chokelahoma Shitty Blunder`\He probably wanted a shot at playing for a good team again at the end of his career. And getting tyus more minutes should be good for his development anyways. No need to make him stick around during a lost season.`\Don't be like that.  We have bad quarters too.`\they look good! way better than the orange ones`\Yeah. Kind of nice to have that kind of respect for the 'scrub'. `\Lmao I love these The Hoopers commercials`\that one bet extended your contention aspirations like another decade`\I'm surprised you're surprised`\RED ROCKET`\Wow you call that a foul?`\Super cold + Spurs getting hacked `\Thunders be bench points in the last 6 games and then tonight.

Wat.  `\It's the jersey`\Holy shit it looks like 90% of the audience left`\They were 23 years old in the 2012 finals. You can't blame them for losing to prime Lebron. If they keep Harden, they all grow together and there is the possibility they would have been the champions in 2014, since they took the Spurs to 6 without Harden and Ibaka was out for half the series. There's no telling what would happen, but I'm putting my money on a team with Prime WB/KD/Harden winning a lot together `\I don't care, I like Chris Paul, and would love it to death if he were on the Spurs`\Does Boban know what a pump fake is? I've never seen him use one. `\Pacers fans gotta take what they can get.`\The up-and-down from you guys to start this quarter is staggering `\You better than this Kawhi `\good to know the spurs can miss a barrage of wide open shots and have the stripes favor the pacers and still make it close`\Haha no actually I didn't`\> He could have a while season of 29ppg and only hit 29 every fucking game

that would simply make him the most consistent player ever
`\Here comes Ty`\He didn't `\Thanks PacerBros!`\We are falling apart and I am so sad`\He's shooting 51.4% from the right corner. http://vorped.com/1-nba/2015-2016/player/1041/1041-Stephen-Curry/shotchart/`\Here we go with this scrub going off against us again`\Green just had his soul taken by that block`\Nobody deserves to win this game. Goodness`\Steve Blake is so hard to watch`\Shit happens, you won't win on the 19th and that's all that matters `\Kawhi would have never taken that shot before, other than the finals, shows how much more aggressive he's gotten`\Danny what in the absolute fuck was that`\Shaqtin'`\Its the NBA any team can beat a team every night. You almost lost to the Sixers. Its an anomaly that the Warriors don't lose at home, the Spurs are undefeated at home too. Crazy runs both teams are on.

Anyway, people are being so dramatic. We're missing one of our assistant coaches in Mo Cheeks due to hip surgery and as the best rebounding team in the NBA got killed on the offensive glass by the Spurs. There are problems, yeah, but I'm not stressing so much about it. They'll figure it out. I hope.

`\He had like three bunnies late in the fourth rim out, not a bad night by any means, especially with the assists and rebounding. `\I hope hawes gets Al's minutes in the 2nd half`\Welp....lets hope for a swift bounce back for the remainder of the season`\After the stadium cleared out, some say a faint Omaha could be heard, almost like a whisper.`\If Parker isn't productive in the playoffs the spurs will have a hard time, especially against OKC, not to mention the Warriors. `\Why is kawhi not getting the ball. If tony has free range to throw up trash jumpers I'm going to be pissed.`\Holy shit, what a meltdown. This was a tie game not too long ago.`\That...is incredible.`\Outplayed in every way, shape, and form from quarters 2-4.  Either this is a wake up call, or a fatal blow.

On another note, hats off to the Hornets.  Great team with a lot of heart.`\It's like Hank Hill doing a TD celebration.`\Right, because it's not like your own team has flopping or bitching either.`\Damn, that's an old ass song.`\It's a joke about Klay trying to not care, but actually caring what people say. `\Ended up in your benefit anyway with Ian shooting`\Hassan has matured exponentially over the past year, but whatever`\GINOBILIIIIIIIIIIII`\How is this pelicans team record so bad. If they play like this all the time, they'd easily be in the playoffs. `\40 points in the half. Pretty disappointing.`\How the fuck did Kawhi make that lol`\He's nowhere near as athletic.  [Robertson was a freak](http://media.npr.org/assets/img/2015/03/13/ap5903010162_custom-eb0ba441a1c8100d268e6956a27ec5f3b93209c4-s1100-c15.jpg).`\Just got home. How have we been playing tonight?`\The Spurs play/shoot like they did in the first 3 quarters against Golden State and they're gonna lose big again. They need to play much, much better to compete on Saturday, just like that 4th quarter.`\I swear, the Spurs *bench* have forgotten how to play defense after the Warriors game.  Just a step behind at all times.

Edit: Nevermind, good effort tonight.`\What the fuck Jeremy Lin...What a performance.`\Anyone coming into the game was probably expecting the Spurs to completely wipe the Hornets off the face of the earth considering what we did to the Warriors, except this was not how it all planned out for us:

- Spurs were killing the Hornets with a 21 point lead in the first quarter, 3 Hornets and a couple of ghosts combined for 7 points.

- Kemba Walker, Marvin Williams and Al Jefferson were playing like shit and couldn't even score from the field for nearly 2 quarters, while Parker came out firing with 12 points already. Lin hasn't even entered the game yet.

- Second quarter Hornets shot themselves back in the game with Lin scoring 12 points off the bench including a 4 point play, penetrating drives from Lee and Zeller rebounding like a man possessed with 8 rebounds.  Walker finally scores with less than 2 minutes in the game but the Hornets are still down 15 points at the half.

- We're doing everything as you would expect us to do in this game. Our starters outscored the Hornets' starters 70-50.  Danny Green was quiet all game and so was Kawhi but at least we were blanketing Walker and Williams on defense, we're screwing up Batum's passing game and forcing 5 turnovers from him and our big guys are doing pretty much what they want down low offensively.

- Third quarter became ugly for us with 7 turnovers and missed shots (Green, Aldridge) with some pretty good defense from the Hornets.  We showed none of the defensive hustle that we had against Golden State, we let Williams score back to back 3 pointers and Lee pick our defense apart and score 13 points at will.

- By the forth quarter we simply did not have the momentum or intensity to match the Hornets who flew out of the gate with Lin killing us with 3 straight three pointers and playing good defense (5 defensive rebounds).  We expected our big guys to keep it close but our shooters died and we couldn't revive them.

Basically we lost because were not prepared for Lin (who shot a perfect 4-4 on three point shooting to add to his 29 points), the Hornet's bench outscoring us 41-18, or Lee/Zeller picking up the pace when we shut Walker and Williams down or the Hornets' hustle on defense (Lee 4 steals).  Hornets played a fantastic game, we'll just have to give them credit and move onto the next one.

One thing you can always count on fans of Lin is that you will get a video highlight almost immediately, so here it is:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZjt-KlsmVE`\lol? he was money with the instrumentals.`\ok, lets break out the third rotation already. Less go Boban!`\Is George hill still rocking that Justin Timberlake dyed fro.`\Rofl`\I looked at the score and thought there was no way they could lose so didn't even bother checking.  Wtf happened?`\Of all things it could have been that's like best case scenario. `\Grizz announcer simply cannot manage to say Boban. Boyan Boyan Boyan.`\I knew it was close, thanks for the answer.`\No, it is not awesome.`\I think he will. He looks way more comfortable, and his scoring is on par with Kawhi now, which is what we need.`\Is this happening?`\He's gonna defer just like LMA did. Give him a dozen games to get comfortable and then he'll know when to shoot. `\I admitt mb not lilliard

but curry tho`\lmao`\PLEASE SHUT THIS ASSHOLE UP SOMEONE`\I'm sure wherever he went for gumbo is a big super secret`\What makes that answer great is that's probably how Pop would've answered it too.`\Can someone please post the gif of Nelly interrupting the Lin post game interview?`\LMA passing up the wide open free throw line jumper???`\And acting as well! If you're Chris Paul `\Chocolate milk is good for you after a workout!

I don't work out, I just really like chocolate milk!`\Lmao good fuckin pass mate`\Guess Manu had balls of steel today so the injury was no concern.`\Thanks, I found him quite good to watch.`\damn Timberwolves look all deflated, head down, no energy, not getting back to defense

KG should talk some sense into them`\Fifth is being generous. `\I really wish the Pacers wouldn't give me a heart attack every game. But damn, good win!`\Ok Patty I love you but *maybe* stop chucking up threes`\Go somewhere else with your toxicity, some of us actually like watching basketball and seeing players grow.`\You're thinking of the Rockets

They had a stadium chanting his name `\Remember when it was a 1 point game? sheesh`\It still wouldn't feel quite right. `\Is there a better backup pg!? Such a luxury to have Mills`\It's all part of our master plan!


....we're just figuring out the rest of it....`\What the fuck is an illegal jump?!`\Good old humble pie.`\Leonard is no doubt a top 5 guy in this league. `\Shooting for us was fucking horrendous. Lots of good SA defense, but we missed a ton of makeable shots. `\Don't forget Duncan.`\Yea, it's better this game than it was against GSW but there's a significant dip in form compared to last year. Watch him closely when he moves sideways, it just looks like he's sore.`\Linsanity back in full effect.`\Stupid Spurs fans, act like they don't care after a loss and act like they're the best when they win...

/s`\Any Clips fans/ any fan know when Blake is coming back?`\this season? try the last few years `\The first quarter of doom is in full effect today`\ What?`\C'mon Kemba.  I believe in you`\Why does everyone say that? Did something happen?`\I'm stating a fact. They still lost after having the lead going into the 4th quarter no matter how you look at it. `\Hornets need to forget about Alfense and let the bench run. `\Shit foul call`\DAMN DANNY BACK AT IT AGAIN WITH THE THR33`\The difference between CP3 in the first half when Kawhi wasn't guarding him and in the second half when Kawhi was guarding him was pretty astounding.`\For sure. I live near SA but never go to games because tickets are prohibitively expensive (unless I want nosebleeds). I'll make my way out for a game sometime this year though. Just eying that calendar. `\it's just not possible for a team to dodge so many bullets. `\I beg to fucking differ`\FYI, when a game is on ABC, you can stream on WatchESPN, even without an ESPN subscription. It's only when the games are on the ESPN channels do they require a login`\kill yourself`\Wow, ESPN's team really has nothing and Blaha and Special K.`\Time to draw up Derek Fisher.`\Timmy bein mad aggressive tonight`\VOODOO DOLL TONY PARKER`\Good luck convincing any other Spurs fans of that. People are too enamored by him having good games every now and then to notice he shuts down any semblance of free flowing offense. Not to mention his pretty much non existent defensive presence.`\We were up like the whole other 3 quarters tho `\38 points. And the Cavs two biggest wins this season have his name attached to them. Clifford has to put him back on bigger minutes as one of the ball handlers and not waste him standing in the corner, watching Kemba and Batum`\I can hardly believe it myself`\Me too! It's on KENS 5 though, I'm getting it here and have the basic shit. I'm picking it up through those over the air channels. Mine is 118-280.`\OMG I LOVE STEVE BLAKE`\Never forget `\We were shooting like .212 from the field through the first. We never really got the shooting on target all night.`\WHO SAYS NO?!?1!1?!?1 XD XD XD BAHAHAHAHAHAHA`\I'm pretty sure dude wears puka shells under that collar. Fucking fat sugar ray looking asshole.`\Jeremy Lin like "Steph Curry, watch this"`\It's really bad lol`\How the hell was that their ball?`\They're getting away with a ton, ya gotta admit`\I swear Jeff Green looks like a POW Vietnam vet sometimes with that dis-shelved 1000 yard stare. `\Execution just isn't there tonight.  Kawhi and Aldridge can bail them out, but only if the defense wakes up.  Can't just blame it all on the refs.`\#fudge`\So is Martin playoff eligible since we signed him so late? `\Still waiting on Rasual Butler to transition into Kobe `\He's a FA next year right? `\check the VLC ones?`\I love how your comment is emphasized by the guy directly below you.`\Good try Danny.

`\Pondexter was low-key good in Memphis.`\SSSSSSHHHHH!!!! Our secret plan!`\Yeah, I can't find it.

Not that I want to find it, but still `\I like describing it as an anarcho-liberal Spurs forum`\Who's coaching?`\He loves it though :p`\I can't wait to celebrate success right`\Bring us home, bench!`\i guess the Spurs decided to give their best Warriors impression`\Spurs fans so insecure. At least the Warriors announcers give credit when the other team is playing well. `\Spurs garbage time lineup is:

Andre Miller
Kevin Martin
Kyle Anderson
Boris Diaw
The BOBAN!

That's insane.`\westbrook sure helped danny find it though with that wide open corner 3`\I swear, that felt elbow jumper by Anderson at the end of the 3rd felt like the first jumper we hit in the entire 3rd.`\I love this team! `\Thanks Mavs fam. My husband is a Mavs fan too! :)`\i want this one badly`\Lebron could take Sixers to playoffs`\This is how it feels to not having pressure to win `\Pop gonna get ejected early tonight.`\Boris Diaw has real long arms and a wide body. He has a great feel for rhythm. Cappuccino!`\I love it, when he and PG play well together we can be a scary matchup for anyone.`\Commentary and ref game at an season low tonight.`\Saddest part of the night: watching a set of parents in spurs jerseys smiling and laughing as their little boy walked slowly a step behind them, head hung low, wearing a Mike Conley jersey. I miss our team too little grizz fan. I miss them too.`\This is how a historic team performs in clutch situations. `\2 things:


1 - LaMarcus got all ball on that Monta "foul" call at the very end. yes it's easy to make that judgement in an instant replay when everything is slow motion, but the whistle was late and you could clearly hear the loud thud of LMA making contact with the ball. not sure how confident the refs were in making that call, but damn that was a 4 pt swing as we clearly were about to get an easy fast-break bucket to pretty much tie the game, or bring it within 1 point i think. this was a huge call but whatever it happens to everyone all the time. we lost. gg Pacers.

2 - now moving forward, were we really going to catch up to the Warriors and take the 1 seed? let's be honest it's highly unlikely. which is why this loss shouldn't matter too much. we still have 3 more match-ups with OKC and the Warriors EACH! i believe we have the hardest schedule to end the season. if we end the season behind the Warriors by 1 game* i will look at this game, and no other game, as the game that killed us. but i dont see us ending up that close at the end of the season. no matter the outcome of this game we're pretty much locked in that 2 seed. the Warriors aren't losing any more than like 2 more games for the rest of the season.



so here's to a healthy finish to our season. glad we got a bad shooting night out of our system because i'd rather us bring our A game against OKC and LAC and GSW. Go Spurs Go.

EDIT: 1 game behind, not 0.5`\ROFL, why was that fan so loud and clear?`\when playoff time comes he's the fourth wing at best.`\Really really hope he sticks around until Pop's gone to take over as HC, but that seems unlikely `\If that happens, I would very much considering flying to Indiana just to watch the Warriors cause it'll be damn sure cheaper than buying a Finals ticket at Oracle. `\If the Spurs lose this we might lose Pop.`\WOW. Took me a sec.... Is this accepted here? lol.
  EDIT: IT APPEARS AS THOUGH THIS IS RACIST. Regardless of the fact that it was an article title, the dude got fired.`\I'd say pop plays to his players strength `\Ive never complained bout refs..

BUT THIS GAME IS BS`\When I get lonely or bored, I do this too. Sometimes, I even re-run all of the 5 championship videos. Haha`\Wiggins has 4 rebounds in the 1st quarter. That's unusual.  `\Danny...ugh`\Future Towns, bud.`\They really are. The jokes may be lame and complete Dad humor but they are having fun with them. They are perfect for this city and making us like them more.`\probably stress`\FSSW is where it's at`\WE IN DIS BITCH! `\That was really funny but Austin could've fucked himself up bad.  Reminded me of 6th man`\The 10 day contract wonder Ray McCallum, Mr. 1st team all offense Tony Allen, Old Man Triple Double #1 Matt Barnes, Old Man Triple Double #2 Zbo (maybe), and the Grizzilla formerly known as Birdman (also maybe.)`\You're murdering us on the offensive glass`\I started watching gsw after first quarter hoping to see a loss there. Now I'm hoping even harder`\holy shit cp3 is good

<choke, gasp, die>`\Who?`\That's where they put the robot parts.`\Wow spurs shitting the bed`\I understand the poor shooting night. Shit happens.

But if this game was being called down the middle this would be a single-digit deficit. `\can spurs just run the offense through Kevin martin. maybe he will have a vintage game`\I am more upset about this then i should be and i didn't even catch the game. Danny Green needs a snickers.`\Ah yes the refs always blatantly favor the Pelicans that must be why we have 23 whole wins.`\based monta`\Spurs did not have enough left after the 1st quarter. Outscored the rest of the way. They should have pace themselves.`\Tell me this is sarcasm bro. `\Is there any way to hide the scored on the sidebar? I want to watch some of those games later.`\Lmfao`\To take his starters out `\No I meant that to show that Celtics really didn't have a coach anywhere near Pop. Pitino was and still is mocked for good reason.`\Danny Green is sinking his threes tonight so far. `\That's a very, very winnable game, but I can't be too mad about the loss. DRose continues to look great, Etwaun had a nice little game, and Justin Holiday showed some real potential. Just can't commit so many turnovers against the San Antonio fucking Spurs. GG Spurs and fans, always a pleasure in the game thread with you guys.`\i've never hated lin, I've always been a fan I just pointed out that in March he was struggling, but he finally found his shot again. Tell me one time I've trashed him in this game thread, like the way you trash Kemba.`\Kawhi and patty tend to turn on the Jets in the last few minutes. `\Why would I agree to something that ain't true?`\rim hahaha`\Did Kemba fuck your girl?`\Announcer: KENICHI EBAÑYA!!!!!

It's Ebina. (E-Bee-Nah)`\tired of Green statpadding his 3pt percentage against the Heat`\Ok`\Unless bogut is playing Timmy will just get toasted by that small lineup.`\That stop on lin's fastbreak almost won them the game tho`\Austin Rivers > Danny Green`\This fucking commercial. `\fuck ya bench stepping up

I didn't, regrets...`\Timmy trying to school up AD`\Thanks! :-) I'll always have love for your OKC team (when we don't play each other)`\i know right!`\He can be the Big Man Defense Whisperer of the spurs.`\So it's on the coach, not "on Derrick". I didn't say it was working`\Seriously, resting your starters for the playoffs seems like a no brainer here.  Who cares if you lose.`\What, a Spurs alley oop!? `\You have to respect the hustle`\God damn it, I love HEB. `\I have Verizon fios before the pervious commercial it went really bad. Now it is back to normal `\It kinda feels like Pippen vs. Rodman situation.`\Kill it with fire. `\Great minds think alike. No idea, though. `\It wasnt egregious but Manu slid into Lance and hurt him, so he couldnt play defense. Spurs get a three on a 5 on 4 possession. Lance is out for a couple of crucial series and he is basically our only offense.`\You think you can sleep with Brent Barry's wife too?`\��`\Ettore Messina`\Bonner's been knocking down them 3s. Probably our best 3 point shooter now with the recent slump from everyone else. `\Mills is SO HYPE`\21 points on 21 shots. Lol`\Still pissed about that. Butler would have been a better option. On the last day that they had to choose, Bonner plays, but then he is back on the bench playing waterboy for Kawhi.

I just don't get it. They should have just given Bonner a front office job and kept Butler. `\Sean Eliott reminds me of a cool high school principal`\Weak call, that's a clean block.`\Please stop.`\patty trills`\Nah man it's cool.`\Going to pretend there is no sarcasm and agree cause I won't lie a little bit of a homer at heart ;)`\Wow`\Lol was that nelly`\So happy to see this result after the obvious knee jerk reaction in the power rankings.  Great fight from Charlotte, especially after that dominating first quarter from the Spurs.`\It's probably cause Lin has been in a slump since before the All star break and there is nothing to report on him. `\his quad actually had a setback `\THE D WEST EFFECT BOYSSSSSSS`\[Super Saiyan Lin](http://i.imgur.com/nlYcW8k.png)`\[here ya go](http://imgur.com/r2t4C)`\GOOO SPURS!

I doubt that Pop will let TP go at least for a few more years.`\Reading these comments, some of you spurs fans are some whiny baby bitches `\What a fucking pass by TD tho...`\Less effective offensively than years prior, but still relevant defensively.

YOU ARE A SCORING MACHINE, GO SHOOT.`\Fucking sit Tony`\They switched it from "Jeff Green with envy" to "JaMychal Green-er with envy", for obvious reasons. That said, the whole concept continues to baffle me.`\You're goddamn right that's a common foul `\Same I still can't believe we have a shot of being of 3rd seed `\The fuck is happening this game?`\Oh God.  Tony brothers.  Cringe... `\....you motherfucker.....`\Wtf happened here? `\What exactly is Danny green being paid to do`\GUYS, THE OFFICIATING WAS TERRIBLE BOTH WAYS. NBA REFS SUCKS.`\Timmy with the most old man shot I've ever seen`\"The Spurs can't beat playoff calibre teams"

"Wake me up when the Spurs beat a contender"

Those two statements were said a few times last month. Well, here you go. `\We honestly played like shit. Tony was horrible tonight.

Thank god LMA, Kawhi and Mills saved us. I don't think it's knee-jerk to say that Mills really should be starting ahead of Tony, and I hate saying that because Tony's my boy, but holy shit he was horrifyingly bad tonight.

It seems like Tony's best possible performance is probably better than what Mills can produce but Mills is more consistent and won't have the same lows that Tony seems to be hitting these days.

Anyhow, happy we finally beat the Pelicans and got that monkey off our back. Ugly win.`\I'm bias but after watching a lot of league pass, they're still my favs.`\I was going to make a thread asking this, but I figured that the game thread was coming up so I'd ask here.

Where do y'all think Boban will end up next year? He signed a one year, $1.2 million contract last offseason, so he'll be on the market this offseason. Do you think other teams will make a play for him?`\lmao the amount of times GRRM used the words 'cock' 'cunt' and 'seed'. Jesus. `\bruh.  I'm watching him the past few games like "we got HIM for two expiring players who have marginal roles on our team?!"  still dont know how we got out of that without giving up a draft pick`\Kawhi is in the NBA.`\I just told my wife that Rivers play is gonna be on Shaqtin a Fool and she says, "What's Shaq-in-a-pool?`\Speak for yourself he is awesome. `\Fuck our management; took us from a young budding contender who had just made the finals, to being the third best team in the west four years later. I wish we could fire Donovan now but I know that's not going to happen. I don't understand why we didn't even explore the possibility of someone like Carlisle coaching but oh well, too late now.`\JEREMY FUCKIN LIN!`\I think Danny Green.`\He knew it but couldnt do anything, behind the basket and couldnt throw an oop, can't do shit with 0.3 seconds`\Let him rest, if he gets enough rest time between now and the playoffs he'll be able to deliver enough to make the magic happen.`\Damn we have 66 pts in 3-1/2 quarters.... That is horrible `\Kawhi! Don't fuck around and get hurt!`\Kyle Anderson is lowkey not that good`\Lol "and one" it was nowhere close, JSimms`\Shaqtin`\The real MVP`\Fuck Drummond has a huge ass!`\I hate when people excuse a superstar call like they deserve it because they are a superstar `\...gonna get you`\When we got Ray Ray I was pretty annoyed, but he's been balling out for us`\lol wtf green`\This announcer just said green isn't a defensive player. Who pays this guy? Fucks sake. Someone link me a Spurs stream plz.`\I wish I could see this game, love watching the second unit`\Do you think the calls have been even?`\Mods deleted the other one lol `\He's OK. He's no Kawhi obviously, but he's alright...that and KD is KD, and there's only so much you can do.`\When I see Kevin Martin play, I can see why the Spurs wanted to sign him, he can create space for his own shot and has a 3ball. The problem is he's not hitting those shots, pretty bad efficiency this season. `\lol, ball don't lie I guess, Gino. Bad call, but we missed`\a toe bruise`\You guys are the Warriors. Our somewhat pretty good three is cancelled out by your 3 point shooting god. `\cp3 has only beat the spurs once in a series though??`\I agree, in a 1 on 1, Id take the best player aka Kawhi, but since this is 5v5 we got 4 other guys to help out with defence`\I thought Courtney did a great job on Parker in the 2nd half too. He killed us early, but then when Courtney started checking him SA's offense bogged down and other guys were having to create. It really helped spark that 3rd quarter run.`\#THERETURN`\Go Spurs!`\That was fun`\It's official.   Lin is having a good night.`\Lin's stepping up when they need him.  Gotta give him credit.`\nice, dissing okc and spurs in one post lmfao`\Come on guys, we're still in it - dig deep, we can do it`\Best defensive rebounding team in the league, bottom ten offensive rebounding. Aldridge is very good though, but they don't really go for O boards`\He's Pikachu Libre`\officially clinched 2nd seed

missed Kawhi's D but everyone else stepped up big time, Aldridge with a monster game`\Duncan D`\You okay man?`\It was down site wide for like 10-15 mins.`\Fuck, I don't even know why I wrote that. Good catch. Edited. `\He always breaks out some westcoast  beat for when kawhi has possesion`\Spurs ain't shit man, they ain't on par with the Warriors. `\Fuck the mavs too while we're at it. `\The most Westbrook shot of all time. `\Pretty soon after Mario Chalmers got hurt.`\OMG, Linsanity is back.`\The refs have been shit, but every time we get close Tony does some stupid shit on a few consecutive possessions to fuck it up. Just glue his damn ass to the bench already.`\I am not sure that the GSW game was not uglier.`\Damn Kyle Anderson, that forehead could battle Peyton's for intergalactic supremecy. `\It's like okc an gsw the a few other teams. I'm looking forward to it but not at the same time.`\Barkley 2016: Make Kawhi great! `\Lmaooo Ryan Anderson ��`\14-0 run`\Alright I shouldn't write you guys off. That's unfair. Isn't lack of depth an issue though? It seems like that's been the case for years. `\That makes sense, I only go for big moves usually. I'll try to mess around with that. Thanks for the tip!`\what is the purpose of wes johnson and prigioni?`\I'd definitely say it's his major weakness on defense. He's getting better at selling contact though, and quite often gets the screener called for offensive fouls.`\Should we get Lin or KD tho?`\Spurs fans so salty lmao`\VERDE`\FINISH HIM!`\Woah! We held OKC under 90! Dem offensive boards in the 4th`\never forget`\https://mobile.twitter.com/spurs/status/707283176935129088`\Is Nelly a hornets fan? since when? `\Just because Duncan is turning 40 next month doesn't mean Spurs are old! `\An outrage is what it is.`\Calderon you were so close :'(`\gg thunder bros, you guys are gonna be SPOOKY good in a few years`\Dang, that halfcourt shot was just a bit strong but right on line!`\Shouldn't be but mods are more concerned with censoring mild trash talk.`\Shaqtin right there`\I saw the hit on Davis, is he out for the game??`\I can't believe we are only losing by 4 points`\You joke, but he's only had one flagrant in his entire career.`\all over the world`\LETS GO BOBAN`\Why did reddit go down`\Or they are shooting badly`\The Warriors are playing a close game with the Timberwolves right now.`\Let's just keep taking threes guys. Don't worry they'll start falling I promise`\Very true `\it feels like a whole millenium has passed since our last game. `\clippers scored only 1 point in the 2nd quarter before he came back in `\I feel like people often forget just how good that Miami Heat team was. I don't know if they would've beat GSW in a 7 game series but they would still be a dominant team and a consistent finals lock.`\If I've been reading Spurs fans comments correctly, Jeremy Lin didn't have an on night, they just can't guard him. `\our players have chekced outta this game `\Wow that 1st quarter didn't really fuckin matter in the end`\MILLER time!.....`\Bro I see you in almost every game thread saying we are gonna lose when the game isn't even close to being over. Don't be so pessimistic. `\Does anyone else think Tissot watches are ugly? `\I can't believe you've done this`\I wanted to avoid the classy word, but holy shit yeah. When Taj got hacked and Fred got T'ed up, every Spurs fan was like "yeah, he got fouled."`\The reason we paid him was a consistent mid range jump shot and he was getting 2.5-3 blocks a game. He doesn't have either of those anymore and all his other talents are gone.

That's clearly still the best part of his game, but it's just not worth all the other terrible shit he's doing on the floor. `\He could get stronger, and more experienced. He certainly hasnt peaked yet.`\So I just tuned in and I hear Jim Pete say that the Big 3 (Parker, Manu, and Tim) aren't playing, so I thought this should be an interesting game. Then I remember they still have Kawhi and LMA.

Spurs ain't fair.`\Scared to death, scared to look, the Clips are shook.`\POP LET HIM HAVE 30 PLEASE`\I THINK Kawhi got bitchslapped by POP after the Hornets ga,e`\Oh`\I've already had my mind set on the 2 seed for like a month now. lol. I never expected us to catch the Warriors.`\He's still developing but he's been a pleasant surprise as of late. He's been more aggressive on the offensive end. I still have high hopes for him. A player of his size that can handle and bring up the ball is a great piece to have. `\Correct. 10 points for slytherin!`\He is a huge man with tiny eyes`\Personally, I can neither choose nor see flairs on the Alien Blue app. `\Hahahahahahah I just noticed my mistake shit`\I guess they're more mad at the fact that he was hot in the first and now he isnt`\We just got outhustled and outplayed. And once again Jeremy Lin kills us. GG Hornets`\RJackson does not get a call unless he's stabbed three times, one of them straight in the eyes.`\Didnt catch the game. Do i need context or is the fact that Duncan is posing like a boss all I need`\The current gap isn't that big, probably 2013 Heats vs. Spurs.`\lamb give the ball to Lin ffs`\I hate those guys`\Ayy, us too!`\Also in shooting, the Spurs have like 10 good shooters, the Pistons have like none `\They aren't the problem... The problem is they can't trust anyone else in the team..I mean you got Ibaka shooting 3's, Roberson is the biggest offensive liability in the league, then you got a bench full if d league guys.. There's only so much they can do and they are just to tired in the 4 after carrying the team..`\I remember that. Frustrating if you are a Nets fan. Warriors fans here acting so high and mighty acting like their flairs existed on this subreddit longer than 2 years ago.`\elemental coffee is pretty close to downtown and has that fancy schmancy stuff`\Huh?`\That's like being tired of sunlight.  It'll always be a thing, so you're better off just learning to live with it.`\"Boy has he struggled from three point- Oh..."`\He's got a surprisingly delicate touch with those huge hands. Has he tried training his mid-ranged jumper? `\Man Eric Gordon is just bad. Numbers be damned, AD is never going anywhere with temmates that can't mesh well and have low basketball IQ.`\You think Green or Klay could be the first option/franchise player of a playoff team? `\Free Kevin Martin `\gg`\Andre Miller and his like ten rebounds is insane too`\Everyone is better than him`\He used to do a dribble up and 3 nearly every game in 13-14 but he doesn't take them anymore because of the lack of confidence.

I'm talking his strict catch and shoot, all year its been hitting the back of the rim and then as it got worse it would go to the far edge.

 He takes a longer shot now when it works. `\maths is hard`\:)`\He seems to play a lot more deny defense this year instead of letting his man catch the ball and play 1-on-1. It's lead to him getting less steals, but it has helped improve our defense as a whole. I think it's because we have more rim protection this year with Aldridge replacing Splitter, who is even more of a positional,non shot blocking defender, than him. No facts to back this up, just eye test though`\He actually looked pretty good out there in his limited time.

Hope he's not out for too long, I think he could give us something that we've never really had. `\Why should Matt get a FO role though? What experience does he have? `\OMGGGG`\Depends. I had a deep bone bruise in my quad that took forever to feel well again. Hopefully it isn't that `\Remind me of the series against the Heat when Shane Battier couldn't hit a three to save his life until game 7 and he just went off `\Let's go SPURS!`\Wtf? They called a foul?`\Gino blocked him and knocked down lance.`\TED CRUZ ATE A BOOGER LMAOOOO`\Dude against the Spurs... They look like Steph and Klay`\Can we stop fouling now? Thanks. `\Oh shit, Tony Brothers is reffing.`\Lol jesus Boban. Looks like he's tossing a ping pong ball.`\And that's why Danny still has a job`\Kyle Anderson nobody will ever bite on your fakes if you never actually shoot it`\You can see flairs on alien blue. It's in settings under comments. `\Kemba take a break, he's drunk. `\This is pleasantly surprising `\Ooooooh that was nice`\The Pelicans have been pretty competitive lately `\Next time man. Who did you pick for the final 4?`\Just want one clean game from Danny....sigh
`\Westbrook, is in there.`\*Shots fired*`\I waited till the game was over. `\Klay is the Alex Moran of the Warriors`\[Robes with no hesitation](https://streamable.com/dfcj)!`\Like fucking roaches when the lights turn on`\Spurs should give* because green plays well against the heat`\Stupid Danny `\Houston always has the chance to beat us. I'm afraid of them`\Revenge for Manu!`\DAMN DANNY
`\Yeah, he started his career with us as an undrafted FA.

He also lived in David Lees apartment when he was picked up by the Knicks.`\How the fuck did we win that after scoring 7 in the first?`\Boban about to check in.  Love that guy!`\Eric Gordon killin us man`\One game behind`\2 minutes what i figure, garbage time.
Yup, says so on box score.`\Patty looks cold right now`\Nope, we played already once in December I think.

So I guess we'll have to see you in the Finals ;)`\Oh he's tried though, I remember some odd floater attempts earlier in the season.`\Unfortunately, I do not have that sort of tech savvy available, since I was just watching a stream. But yeah, Lance basically put his forearm into Simmon's lower stomach and pushed him back. If you find a replay, let me know. I was drinking so I may not remember totally correctly.`\Jump ball?`\I don't give a rat's ass about practice. Anthony Morrow has in-game results.`\LMA eating`\McBob wtf`\Not if were thinking playoffs. Were not getting the one seed anymore. Gotta pick our battles if we wanna survive `\We are all witnesses`\But the officials are gonna review the scene if Allen was behind the line`\Why oh why is Kyle Singler in the game?`\The real tragedy of that game was Quinn Buckner.

He gave us gems such as:

"Danny Green isn't really a defensive player"

"Kawhi Leonard used to be a finesse player"

And saying Duncan deserved a tech after he threw his arms up in frustration after a foul. `\...too`\We would have gotten 2 points either way since Adams dunked it right after.`\seriously. They are letting Davis get away with MURDER right now`\What's hilarious is that they've exclusively tried to improve their bench for the past 2 years.`\You mean "ChokeKC?"`\Pop would have sat him after that`\KCP two different players since the last time we played em.`\Wtf are we doing `\Dear god, I don't pray often and I don't really believe in you, but could you please give Jon Barry 'food poisoning' at halftime`\LMAO WAT, THAT WAS FUCKIN UNEXPECTED `\Pop: Extra Hot Wing coupons for you if Spurs wins tonight.


Kawhi: K. `\Man if Davis started getting 20 shots a night these dudes would be scary, no name besides Davis and they can really hang in there`\Not much.`\So has Patty Thrills.`\hey guys we're back`\Because we were playing trash basketball and our coach wants us to get some more practice working well`\Right.. And I am also stating facts.

Fact: Second night of a back to back

Fact: 2 point lead heading into the fourth

Fact: The game was on the road IN San Antonio `\Jesus`\Whatever happens here tonight lets all agree on one thing. Fuck the Clippers!`\I realize this. I like both teams, so I like to see both do well.

kewl`\Start running your offense through Duncan.`\I don't know, but one thing that sticks out to me is that Kanter has averaged less than 20 minutes a game since February. Also, I think the media narrative is killing this team. We needed home support in a rough period transitioning to a new coach, but instead we've got the entire nation and every commentator shitting on our team every night. Now we've probably got KD and Westbrook really considering what their plans are.


edit: Ooo, oo, Morrow's minutes have been pulled back too, and he's now riding the bench so much that he's completely lost his shot. There was no cause for this benching, Donovan just doesn't like good role players I guess, preferring single minded defensive effort over any kind of winning strategy. `\No one expected the Jeremy Linsanity`\Man we could've ended a streak`\hahahaha that was austin's career lowlight`\The racism, homophobia and player fan BS is pretty terrible there, tbh.

I mean he has played like 13 years, with playoff games every year.

On top of that, the PG position has become so athletic and dominant with guys like Curry, WB, CP3, Dame (all potential matchups in the WCSF, or WCF) that it makes it that much harder for him to keep up on offense and defense.

If he's on, he's on and dropping 20/10 which is great, but only happens every now and then. The other games he looks miserable on offense since he doesn't have elite elite vision (surprised that his passing seems to have dropped off since 2013) or ability to be a volume shooter. and even worse on defense.`\Probably the downvote bots or something, I always get downvoted in game threads`\I understand why there's a rule regarding it, I just hate how it's abused.`\Our schedule is backloaded. /r/nba has brought this up countless times.

So my counterpoint is that Leonard is still the more accurate shooter if you are looking at percentages only.

Of course this doesn't measure the difficulty of shots where Curry makes his case as being the best shooter in the game. It's one thing to shoot 48% on spot up threes that come up through missed defensive rotations, and completely another when someone is shooting 45% on pull up threes from all over the place with defenders hangibg off his body.

I don't think anyone thinks that Leonard is the better shooter unless they have never seen a game played in their life.`\No sir.

We're more or less locked into the 2 seed at this point.`\Why is the court so bright?`\Lance is always 68% fancier than he needs to be.`\DJ Quake is the shit. He was playing some Nas and Mobb Deep back to back the other game.`\what a hOOdlum`\I guess ignoring the fact that neither team had great shooting night constitutes a good argument.`\And also warriors are playing the second game of a back to back. First Utah then the spurs `\Damn I'm pissed the gang isn't here when were on TNT. Screw these NBA TV knockoffs!!`\maybe it's because they are up by 20???`\I know, it just means he's going to miss time.`\Kawhi you bad bad baaaad man!`\Hopefully the Bulls don't get their ass eaten `\I was wondering when Simmons was gonna burn Barnes. Barnes has been playing so far off the guy. `\That missed Morrow layup at the end tho`\Enough with the fouls. Just end the game please for the love of god.`\The Bulls had 0 fouls called on them in the first 11 minutes`\If Danny breathes that's a foul. `\With no regard holy shit `\Damn JaMychal looks tiny next to Duncan.`\Had it been Danny's show he woulda thrown it to the 5th row`\WOW`\I loaded up on those salmon dinners the other day.`\7!`\Yes. If a guy taps the ball up to the rim 3 times and makes the last he'll have 3 rebounds and be 1 of 3 on shots.`\Cmon KD lets see a tryout for the dubs with a huge win tonight`\PG had fouled Kawhi every fucking attempt`\Holy shit I just realized that Florida has two teams. I'm so bad at geography :(`\What a pass`\and with that, ladies and gentlemen, i bid you all adieu`\Yeah, for some reason Tony didn't pass it to him the first time when he asked for it even though Tony was awful tonight and Kawhi was on fire during the fourth.  Popovich made Tony straight and finally gave it to Kawhi.`\Kevin Martin and Andre Miller face up against their former squad.

Let's get it get it, wolverbros.`\what is Tony doing?!! Give the ball to Kawhi!!!`\This defense looks so flimsy`\Seeing how much contact PG gets away with is insane `\Boban is not a good actor.`\My stream has been shoddy so I've seen only half of the game so far.

`\Alright, I'm here. Ready to get butt fucked.`\yeah fucking right`\Lol I wouldn't make any judgements based on this game. If our bench was playing your starters we would get creamed.`\no prob, yall are my fave East team`\I love how they always complain about how he "takes away shots" from Kawhi and LMA (as in those two are the only two people allowed to shoot on our team), but are totally quiet when Patty goes 1/8 or whatever from 3.

Like, the hate is so idiotic it's blatant `\yeah that happens. I'll go take a dump or something and it went from a close game to 20 point lead.

What other team has 2 of the top 8 players in the league? Durant and Westbrook are already above average defenders and use up 65% of Thunder possessions on offense. If you can't plug in role players and have a great team with that, your strategy is off.`\That game was never really close.

OKC melted down in the last seconds of regulation AND overtime. That can fuck with your mind. They're not playing with confidence anymore.`\Yep. I always give it a smirk and hit the back button.

From the games I have watched of you guys - I am not seeing much that is impressive from Donovan `\His best years are definitely behind him`\we're too blessed with not one but 2 elite defensive guards `\aww`\holy fuck, I knew the grizz were decimated, but damn looking at that starting lineup really puts things in persepctive. `\#STEVE BLAKE. . . `\By spurs standards. 27 by any other team is nothing to sneeze at.`\How does that make any sense. When looking at best player are you not accounting for offense and defense?`\Thunder pls. `\If he could just shoot one more FT per game, he'd average 20 points a game. `\Two words: Lauren Holtkamp.`\I gotta say, I'm really digging birdman's new look. Looks like he just moved his hair down to his face, but it looks much better imo.`\fuck it raise your farmars `\yup we needed him tonight. oh well`\Refs are beyond garbage. Especially when Vogel can talk them into making a call.`\Well I take solace in the fact that the stache brothers are playing pretty well.`\I also believe Melo didn't like Lin, or the attention he got. `\He's a 7'3" monster that mostly plays against third-stringers in garbage time. His per-minute stats would drop severely if he played more minutes.`\Nobody touched him `\Boris and Patty combined for 30 points tonight! [Yeehaw!] (https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CemEsTmWEAA7JTT.jpg)`\she just had 2 kids, cut her some slack `\He can shoot right over Trump's wall.`\The definition of eloquence. `\um... that isn't exactly what i was getting at but, to each his own`\at least our next 3 games looks okay for us. What a shitty game.`\I don't get it. Patrick = Patty`\Fuck man I'm standing in line at whole foods`\I've never seen Kawhi miss that bad `\The REAL big 3?`\Perkins is so.. big.`\He's tall, dark, and handsome. I'm sure if you saw him you'd recognize him. `\You can buy a $10 upper level ticket and walk down to center court lower level or lower level behind a bench.`\I'm gonna say yes. He hit his career high steals in the first half, and he's still out there.`\"It's the hope that kills you" - Doc`\I want the Spurs to continue their historic run, but I also want Lin to shoot himself out of his slump...hmm...`\He dribbled after the foul too.`\sometimes you forget how stupid fast westbrook is`\Have you seen the score of the game?`\Well, they are.`\I still think he will develop nicely once he gets some good coaching.`\>Quit bitching

Oh my god, the irony.`\Refs have been horrible and theyre keeping Pelicans in the game`\Chalm :( I cry everytime`\GS has to play in Dallas tomorrow though`\When they're healthy, NO is the worst matchup for the Spurs.`\I fucking love David West. `\I can get used to the Andre Miller-Jonathon Simmons connection`\LMA is so good omg`\lol no you won't. All these recent losses aren't accidents. They are specifically because the team eexclusively plays streetball offense when it's close, while barely trying on defense. `\1972 Bucks, maybe?  They have (had) the scoring differential record, and I think their record was something like 62-20, which means they must have blown out a lot of opponents.`\Shit, sorry. None of my links are Spurs streams. I'm using vipleague.se`\I can't trash talk back? Well, that's no fun. `\Spurs fans tend to be hopelessly delusional rather than pragmatic. `\Shaq ran to the board! *Take a drink!*`\Not saying the refs haven't been bad. But they're not the reason your losing.`\Stream? `\Except 1 of those guys was actually fouled.`\You know that's not what I meant... The truth is our defense has regressed horribly this year and our lineups in crunch-time stay the same even though we get the same outcome. Shooting poorly tonight may have had to do with us getting piss poor looks and us not taking the time to call a play. In the last 5 minutes I saw us call one timeout and that was 30 seconds to go when basically all hope was gone and that was the first time I noticed us run a play in that time span.`\I knew he was playing poorly tonight but seeing that stat in text form is super depressing`\I forgot everyone one reddit bangs 10s daily. `\Fuck to late to take it back?`\Blake please you are killing me.`\Cooked em`\Tobias is helping quite a bit.`\lol, that Manu air ball about encapsulates the game so far`\Westbrook acting like he's hot shit right now lol`\With five seconds remaining `\Those are just the bandwagon/fair weather ones. A 26 game losing streak is enough to humble you for at least 5 years. `\Such good basketball.`\LMA finally coming into his own on our team. `\Oh man, please tell me you're researching some stuff from WWII Italy and Germany.

Edit: I still have a Fascism book from a political ideology class that has plenty of quotes on action and anti-intellectualism and I've wanted to write a paper on that stuff, but now I'm a graduate and I want to write papers on everything. `\My Pop*`\Had the same thought`\How much did he reportedly have?`\Every single game I have to watch this TSR injury law commercial and they are like "is your team winning right now?"

Nope.`\to be fair, the Richard Jefferson experiment kinda damped any excitement Spurs fans had for free agency.

Then Aldridge and West swing the pendulum back in the other direction.`\Oh, I believed they still had McCallum but it seems they waived him. I guess it makes sense now.`\I don't think what few minutes he's had is enough to make any of those kinds of statements.`\Shaun Livingston and a mole rat.`\Like he is stuck between a rock and a hard place.

Edit: nvm they playing gsw right now `\the mere fact you're calling it that lets me know you're not ready`\After all these injuries and terrible luck, something has to go right for you guys`\And 1`\Come on, he's worth at least some hot Cheetos.`\Definitely a shitshow`\This is why I couldn't stand Parker in the blowout losses to the warriors, cavs and clippers. It was so frustrating to watch Parker drag the team down and dig them into a hole that the bench had to fix. Pop can be stubborn sometimes, you'll see Mills come in and make a few threes or make a great play but gets benched in favor of Parker's mid range bricks or failed drives. Parker doesn't deserve playing time in late game situations or close games, he doesn't contribute on either end of the court. He's been so subpar this season, no one notices because they are 53-10. I remember Pop subbing in Cory Joseph for TP last season when they had close games, just for his defense. Now with Parker in, it's an easy bucket for the other team lol`\I <3 duck`\So this is my first time doing this game thread thing because PTR's got no live tweeting. This is fun. I should do this more. :D`\I just meant it happens every thread towards whatever team is complaining. I'm drunk and may have misunderstood. but whatever, it was a good game by y'all `\40 straight home wins and still overshadowed by the warriors home steak in the same season. Good luck to anyone having to play up to 4 times in a series against these two.`\it's Miller time`\GINO`\Playing dirty. Just disgusting`\I guess all that planning, scheming, effort, energy, and hustle were all used up in that Warriors game huh. *wink* `\Patty is everywherev`\I truly hate the Warriors and, even though I always expect to lose to them, I get super pissed when we play them.  I'm strangely okay with losing to the Spurs.  I'd rather we not, but it seems inevitable.  I just can't dislike them.`\my lord these REFS are whack`\wth,  Canadian Kids are so talented!`\KMart is an amazing pickup holy shit`\Fuck Zaza pachulia `\Eh fuck em man. This sub can be volatile sometimes just do you `\pelicans on fiyah`\Post-RRT Kawhi is a monster. `\"Hey little Timmy?! Remember when we *swept* your sorry asses again?"

"Dad, please, let it go"

`\Overall, he's shooting 35% from 3pt for the season. That's because his 2016 has been pretty good from 3pt line. In certain games, he'll have games like this.

edit: TO get to 35% for the season, he had to shoot 49.1 in Jan and 36.7% in Feb of 2016.`\WHY CAN WE NOT STOP THIS TEAM?????  The Pelicans are starting to become my least favorite team.`\Warriors, Cavs, Lakers, Thunder, Rockets all get more coverage than us. Probably another couple teams too but those five for sure.`\Kawhi with emotion is �� also LA CLUTCH. `\shooting 35%? I don't understand his 3 is terrible. I mean his FG% is not horrible, but his 3% is trash. `\Buzzzzzzzzzzzzz`\And the NBA put the Spurs above the Warriors in the power rankings lol`\Spurs fans acting like Rockets fans real quick`\why didnt Boban dunk that?!!`\Yeah man, I'm more annoyed we didn't give a better foul if we were going to foul, it was the right call.`\The LMA overrated crowd is going to get a real shock when the playoffs roll around `\PATTY MOTHERFUCKING THRILLS!!!`\OFFENSIVE REBOUNDS!! WOOO`\He's had one too many knee injuries I'm afraid. `\tyreke evans, jrue, that french center, is brian roberts still on the pelicans? thats pretty much it i think  `\Smoke bitches`\Thank u for including us`\Now we did come back against Nuggets on Saturday just like this.  Let's just hope San Antonio doesn't suddenly up their shooting percentage to 95% like Denver did.`\they dont wanna respect the hornets`\yeah lol i refreshed the comments and when i looked back it was 20 point lead`\thats because the spurs are boring. they're an all time great time but they are just so damn plain. which makes sense considering their main guy is kawhi leonard, the most unassuming superstar in the league `\Throwin' up bricks but playin' mad defense.`\He seems to go for the strip rather then defend the shot.`\Patty's beard game is on point.`\Don't you spread that evil around here`\Letting bench guys run to get them ready for the playoffs/seeing who looks good doing what `\Learn satire`\1-0 since Peyton retired. He's watching over Indy sports.`\About once every 10 games lol `\Goddamn. Wtf is wrong with ur team. You have it worse than us.`\Jeremy fucking Lin does it again `\God...now I want some Whataburger at 2:48am...welp...where are my keys.`\he's super long as well`\Dat shooting form Martin D:`\ALL BALL`\Yes, the refs were shit, but we can't play like we did tonight in the playoffs and expect to win.

We missed a ton of easy shots, we didn't box out on the rebounds, we had too many empty possessions.
We need to rebound for the Wolves game and come home with at least one win.
`\Prettty sure that was Kyle Anderson throwing a sweatband, but I could be wrong.`\He's a madman`\We know they'll be talking soon enough.`\he's got that nice david west-esque jumpshot. `\Kawhi and lma man. So good this quarter. `\Ya becky hammond`\Just turned the game on. What I miss?`\Holy cow these refs are just vapid little twits.  They've probably missed a half dozen OOB calls, as well as seemingly deciding that nothing is a shooting foul.

Not sure if it would have helped us (it's been unbiased in it's terribleness) but holy fuck is it hard to watch a game reffed this incapably.`\They can't.  But we can't win without our main core players either.  The same applies for Golden State if they should lose Stephen Curry.`\Lol that would've been sick Vince `\I WAS USING SARCASM WOW HURT`\Warriors weren't exactly playing supreme basketball today either. They almost lost control of the game at the end and banked it with pure clutch shot by Klay. Would say all top teams are being exposed on their vulnerabilities right now.`\After I replied talking about threes generally speaking, which, no matter the shooter, are probably going to miss.

Also, Curry's corner 3s, according to BB ref are 47% this season, also probably going to miss. Though he's at 53% for his career.

The conversation went like this:

Somebody: When Danny Green shoots a three, it's probably going to miss.

Me: When anybody shoots a three, it's probably going to miss.

You: Something technically wrong this season and totally irrelevant to the conversation. (Curry corner 3s)`\I very much enjoy Lance's step-up-ness.  That's a word. why?`\Too true. Ours is Milwaukee `\So early though. We dig ourselves a hole but we aren't going to play like this all night. `\The dude def thinks VC is on a 10-day`\Was a good play, though.`\Yet another shitty game by Parker. `\Kawhi is probably done for the game honestly, we're rolling now`\Andre with the Tim Duncan laserbeam jumper lol`\Goddamn that shake Kawhi!`\Damn, Danny's way off with his threes! `\Because it's a multiple of 5? Ok lol`\Hot blonde behind spurs bench`\CP3 saw he didn't have a shoe on and attacked him.`\What's up with the score? What's up with the game!!!????

Not home yet, don't know what the fuck is going on`\Getting paid either way, might as well let it fly.`\They're also now guaranteed to tie their best record in franchise history with this win.`\I like how 2 points is just "a lead". Would we still have this narrative if we were down 2? Probably, but just because people are trying their hardest to push this. We've had meltdowns. LAC and Indiana were definitely examples. This was not. `\that state farm commercial...`\Yeah well I upvoted you ha`\Nothing is going well for Lance.  Poor buddy.`\Hopefully the bench can get things going `\����`\As a Thunder fan im freaking out. Not just about this season anymore, but starting to think KD might just leave us...`\Did SloMo seriously just miss that layup`\hmmm so celtic's fans aren't the only fans that complain about the refs r/nba...`\A Song of Ice and Fire, I think. `\Thunder aren't going to win a championship, you have to support your star player and ANOTHER star player isn't always the best answer. I see Durant leaving in free agency.  I wish he would come to utah because he might be able to win a championship there with all our young talent, but I bet he goes to some stupid overpowered team and makes the league even more top heavy.

The Lakers just need to have a decent supporting cast,  which adding a solid vet or two to their young core 4 (plus possibly a top 3 pick from this draft) will do,  and they'll have enough cap to sign two premier players players as well.  The Lakers are in prime position to get better next year.  They just need to sign some vets that are above average to form some cohesion/stability to the rising talent of their young guys.  A star the following off-season (Westbrook probably) would be intrigued especially if they are able to bring someone else aboard as well. `\the ref warned him there too, the refs have been trash on both sides tonight`\Somehow through the course of this Meme's birth, some people have started to think he's ACTUALLY a future star and it is mind boggling.

I can't tell without the line lighting up and flashing for me.`\I don't think you would...no way Melo goes on record for something like that. He cares about his image too much, and if he had spoken out against Lin like that it would've been political suicide.

Remember, this was right after Linsanity. The Knicks were faltering and the season was looking pretty grim...then Lin came along and turned things around in one of the best sporting spectacles I've ever seen. There was no one more loved in NY.

And that was the problem I think. Melo wanted this to be his team, he wanted to be the one to bring NY to glory. At the time too, his game was being questioned like crazy. I remember dozens of articles talking about how Melo coming back (he was out for a bit from injury) would ruin the Knicks, and ruin Linsanity. That we were better without him.

You're right, there's no actual evidence, but I strongly believe that Melo helped push Lin out the door. `\Like literally nobody boxed out there.`\Green with another shot when it doesn't count.

Good defensive stops, several offensive rebounds. Not a single timeout from Donovan. Not a single substitution.

How can you watch your team struggle so much on offense but leave Kanter on the bench? It's not like Ibaka was playing great defense either. Plus Ibaka was looking like an offensive liability out there. How many passes did he fail to catch?

he has a good game every now and then (like the one last night) but more often than not watching him is just straight up frustrating. he is still nowhere near a good defender and he lost that one thing that made him great on offense: his quickness.

And that's the Hurricanes.  Really no interest in that outside of Raleigh.  Our other two teams are the Hornets and the Panthers.  This is about as good as the Hornets have ever done and the Panthers have never had back to back winning seasons.  In my experience people aren't willing to really stop pulling for their favorite team just because a new team has been created in their area until that team wins at least one championship or finds a way to be at least mostly successful.`\Which I've said as well he's like Diaw -  lite, but there's a pretty vocal group that thinks he's going to be some major piece of our future, that I can't agree with personally, but this suddenly makes me some heathen.

He's earned it with his recent play, though.`\gg?`\Nobody forgot Curry.`\He pretty much only takes corner threes unless absolutely necessary.`\He has a decent midrange and gets quite a few steals with his long arms`\Seriously tho, Holiday is playing like what we wanted Tony Snell to be.`\AND 1`\jesus spurs we concede just stop`\Just tuning in. WTF is going on with the Spurs?`\He's off his game

There are no good coffee places in OKC except for chain places like Caribou or Starbucks`\national tv salt. lezzzzzgo!`\SO MUCH GOOD FUCKING BASKETBALL AS A MAVS AND AGGIE FAN THE LAST TWO DAYS `\that's one game, two at most`\I've been watching him all season, still not used to looking at him.`\LOL Amin. `\Snell will never see minutes again.`\why would you double andre miller? `\Idk maybe that has something to do with other teams getting better? And us getting injured every year? We have two of the historically best teams in the west. In fucking history. Let's blame our FO for 9/11 too. `\911 was staged`\Andre Miller outhustling the youngins. I fucking love that.`\Lazy ass Parker`\Marv Albert. Crap.`\wow that same move was a foul last night on drummond wtf`\He shoots like he just pulled the ball out of his front right pocket.`\Not to mention that one win against GS.`\Sixers are scary for us`\Jesus Spurs fans are so damn annoying, acting like a bunch of kids in the game thread`\GET THAT 30 KAWHI`\What the fuck `\he is the greatest Spur killer ever...he will never have a game as good as this for the rest of the season`\We won this with Lawson playing 8 min. and without Lavoy/CJ miles. GREAT win!`\I still dont put anything past Pablo "single handedly almost beat the Warriors" prigioni`\Mills knows his role. I think Parker still believes he can be clutch and to his credit, he has his moments.

It's on Popovich to pull the plug on Parker in close games if he's hurting the flow of the offense. `\Jeremy Lin had 35 points and carried the hornets against the raptors earlier this season`\All about those SJW and tumblrinas`\Cause that's who Monta is. (not saying it's a negative thing)`\There was a lot of media hype over it, but I never saw actual evidence`\Wow so many off ball fouls on both sides on that last play lol`\Jaysus Vince.  Those do usually go in for him.  Think we should've been given the points on principle.`\so hot this LMA`\so how come rasual is everybody's favorite spur all of a sudden over a guy who's been with us for 10 years`\I still think TP will turn it on in the play offs`\It's so clearly psychological too. There's just something wrong with his confidence`\Ah, I think you'll get it`\The top comments are all defeatist let's fucking change that. `\I would piss my pants`\I wonder if J. Simmons talked shit to Westbrook like he did to Curry`\If the Spurs were still up by 20+ by the 4th quarter Pop would sit him for the rest of the game no matter how good he was doing`\THATS WHY YALL LOST BY 43 LAST NIGHT`\Looks like you didn't need me :(`\No one says big men can't hit free throws. You're taking to a guy who regularly watches Marc and ZBo hit them. They say certain guys can't. And I like Boban himself. I'm just annoyed by the circlejerk.`\Damn let's go back to moving the ball not forcing things`\Did someone say steak?`\how have we not reached 40 points`\you scored more points than the spurs... I think`\Why do refs always grab each other when they talk to one another?`\The fuck is this dance cam right now?`\Fuck off Westbrook, seriously? That was totally clean and you decide to hang back and bitch to the ref instead of getting back on defense. Thanks for the free points.`\honestly i was getting a bit annoyed with this guy but after he complained for a technical i think ive just about had it lol`\Parker the offense killer`\I too am disappointed. It's an international tragedy.`\Always wonder if SA is a nice place to live. Are people cool? Is there a nightlife? Are there any good paying jobs down there?`\Shup up. Patty can run the offense. The offense is get the ball into the hands of our two stars and hit your open threes without over dribbling. Parker can only do one of those things right now. `\Why is Parker back in the game? ugh`\boban killing it?`\It's not really that funny when you do it ironically either`\I don't know how he meant it and I know I've heard it before but I still laughed.`\[So he's kronk?](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-PCbKowBPOO8/UkC8pjQtBnI/AAAAAAAAGO0/7SCpshutQuI/s1600/Kronk+&+his+puffs.jpg)`\You leave Frankenstein's monster alone! `\32-0

feelsgoodman`\I love Matt Bonner with all my heart. Dude can fuck you up with the 3 point shot and that nasty ass floater. Matt Bonner is a thug.`\#LIN FOR PRESIDENT`\Hopefully now we can get rid of the "Spurs only beat the bad teams" saying `\Holiday thinks he's Curry. `\OKC's defense really was good in the third quarter. SA couldn't find anything and really looked like they were struggling.`\They're far better than a 60 win team from just last year..`\What just happened? I turned it off after the 7 point first quarter, flipped back with 1:30 left in the 4th. We won? What? How?`\Lesser of two evils...*throws up in mouth*`\JJ YOURE NOT THAT GOOD`\I still can't believe David west is on their bench. `\Way to close the game out! GSG!`\Zeller is going crazy damn!`\Why the fuck aren't they reviewing that?`\we play the shorthanded memphis next, but okc after that. So hopefully he's good by then. `\The Internet,  probably.  `\They took Perk out smfh`\Spurs make me shake my head sometimes. Even though they do not outwardly show it, they get cocky after big wins and end up losing games they shouldn't.

Just to throw it out there, I am not saying in anyway the Hornets are an easy win. Just at this point in the season you shouldn't drop games like this when you hold them to 7 points in the first. `\LolBoban`\The River Walk is cool if you like Mexican food and walking slowly behind/bumping shoulders with Hispanic families who bring all 5 living generations `\Wasnt really seamless. Pop had to scream at tony `\*unzips*`\This is LiT`\We out here `\still can't believe that 23 point deficit`\HE STILL LOVES HIS HOME`\This year's Pistons are legit. All of our games have been awesome so far.`\I think Butler is getting cut `\like pop says, always have good defense, your shooting isn't going to be on every night, but if your defense is on every night youre good`\They did it with Walker making 6 points and 2 assists? If they make the finals, Spurs gotta watch out!`\MVPATTY OI OI OI`\love me some SloMo `\I always think something huge has happened also. `\Danny is back! Warriors are fucked!`\I'm disappointed in OKC. They blew another 4th quarter lead. At this point it's not a coincidence. `\LINSANITY LIVES`\He has been shooting incredibly poorly, but I don't think the stat makes that much sense when excluding two good games from him `\I guess that's understandable. The only matchup that matters is the WCF but idk how historic of a season you guys need to have absolute faith in your team. `\GG, great defensive battle. `\Good statline but he's no Boban.`\awwww, that Boban dunk would have been sweet`\"Kawhi you had your sixth straight 20 point game and you guys are 33-0 at home"

- All I know is, my gut says maybe`\I still can't tell whos better Jeremy lamb or troy..`\Your jokes suck `\Yeah there's a big bow on it and everything dude

/s`\Looks like Mills hasn't shaken the cold streak he was having last game`\Man that was a ridiculously good defensive showing from both teams `\Need em both Kawhi!`\Fuck the Clippers`\Thoughts and prayers `\you literally just edited ur post like 2 seconds after I posted and added williams.`\Just play the Jeremies the whole game. `\Danny Green really not playing well...`\He's so dangly`\Tobias <3`\I don't know how we pissed away such a great lead in the first quarter, but we did. 0/7 for Green, and 0/5 for Diaw. We deserved to lose.`\I'd still watch the Knicks if I were you, especially when our bench is playing.`\[add a -stream to reddit in the url.](http://reddit-stream.com/comments/48p59e/)`\I like Conley and Gasol, but man I can't stand Barnes or farmar`\Wouldn't have worked `\yes, the hornets are so much better than the Warriors`\You smart `\#\#SCENES`\HOW DID WE DO THAT?!`\We're almost definitely not losing the second seed and probably not gaining the first seed.  The Spurs are too blessed to be stressed.`\Gordon with the it's my contract year no pass to AD`\Kawhi said, "get that weak shit out of here."`\[Ain't game til Serge does his thing](https://streamable.com/3nbe)`\Aldridge 10 Grizzlies 11`\I'm not even mad. Lin was ferocious.`\Remember when the bench was carrying this team at the start of the season? What happened to that?`\Isn't the point of shit talking a going back and forth?`\Refs watching a stream that is lagging`\This halftime show is actually pretty cool`\With the way Lance is playing for the Griz, they really should have kept him and gave him the chance.`\Clippers confirmed spoiler`\He was really solid early in the season and even coming out of the all star break but out of the last 6 games he's scored over 10 points once (23 against Chicago) I'm not blaming Parker by any means but we need him to consistently knock down those mid range jumpers which he hasn't been doing recently `\Hope so, have a good one`\i know that which is why i'm counting the games til the playoffs. Scrubs like Lee and Rin and other players like them will never do stuff like this in a playoff setting`\THANKS BRO WOOO GET HYPE `\Monta really have it all <3`\... does this box score always look this nice or am I just say that this is more shocking after the first.`\GG Grizz. Made us work for it without any of your stars. `\BULLSHIT!`\The Warriors lost to the Spurs. The Spurs lost to the Hornets.


Therefore, Hornets>Warriors`\Pop timing LMA's return to the last 5 minutes. `\Last night nothing was going in. Tonight we're making everything.. Law of averages I guess `\Heck, let him start cause Pop pulled Parker within 1 minute. Parker could come off the bench until manu comes back.`\Flair up! `\/r/nbastreams bruh`\32% from a big. I would rather West not gamble on a shot he will not block and just contest it without committing so hard.`\Slo Mo no`\Lin was looking like MJ tonight. We were doomed. `\I don't have cable, and even if I did I would only get Mavs games �� Fuck the Mavs.`\WTF GREEN`\>THE RIDE NEVER ENDS MOTHERFUCKER, ASK THE GRIZZLIES


http://m.imgur.com/2YnBt`\True. We played like straight ass against the Warriors and Raps. That Thunder game wasnt that bad IIRC and we're 1-1 against Clips so those are more of a toss up. `\I like my ability to eyeball things. I watch nba enough to make conclusions, even though I could easily be wrong. You can say that shit to anyone without Charlotte flair really.

I don't doubt your intellectual ability, but you shouldn't be outraged at random fans expressing their opinions. I also hear Lin complain about himself during interviews, so I take it he isn't 100% happy with his performance/role. But I'm sure you know better!`\Last Thunder field goal came at 3:52 left in the fourth. I think you could argue they choked away an opportunity to win the game `\Lol if you watch a rockets game you'd see how much our offense relies on harden. I don't think there's another player in the league with the offensive load harden takes on for the rockets. `\He had his usual problems of catching/holding the ball, so there was no offense.

But he did scare people away from the basket just by standing nearby.`\I don't think so. I like our navy alternates the most. `\Wiggins has 4 rebounds?`\Just lendin' you a hand.`\Listen, I'm not going to deny that CP3 a bastard, but that just makes me like him more. He's such an incredible player I just look past all that shit. Besides, he's not the only player to do such a thing.`\Yea I just saw that. It was brutal for the Hornets.`\You got nothing to complain about, we locked Singler up for 4+1 years on $5 million a year, that's a shit contract.`\Finally some points jesus`\Strong Jinx Game. these announcers smart`\Lol refs just swallowed their whistles for those last 45 seconds`\whats the story of the officiating of the game? I just started up, but from what Ive seen so far its looked like the Spurs arent getting many calls.`\Do I sense sarcasm?`\Ginobili and Danny 9/12 on threes, Manu got 20 pts in 24 min on 7/10

Hnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnngh`\What was that foul on Kawhi? Didn't see anything`\Lmao guys he's a warriors fan `\Not at all.  Curry is not even close to the best two-way player, but far and away the best player overall.`\Bum ass Parker trying to throw the fucking game after getting carried by Aldridge and Leonard. Thank god Pop subbed his heavy ass out in crunch time.`\You think adding last years MVP runner up, who already has proven chemistry with those two would be a negative addition to the team? Holy circle jerk. `\29 February, 2016`\Never said he wasn't`\to be fair, beating the best team in the league gave them that high.

The problem was that they expected the Hornets to just give up, but honestly they're probably one of the more resilient teams in the league.`\420 left guys eeeee`\spurs fans are petty as fuck bro, dont worry about it`\Gentry is so chill`\Damn LaMarcus is playing beautifully right now. It's like fucking poetry :'( `\Holy shit what a game`\What is happening Reddit???`\And they've been in the bonus both quarters. My god`\I seriously think this will happen. There is just not enough offense on this team. Pop is not going to bench Parker. They never really addressed the major problems the Spurs had at the point guard position. Mills is not a starting PG and Miller is 100 years old.
`\So you're just going around insulting the Pacers because you're a nice guy.  Okay, bud.`\He's a good defender but he tries for blocks so much that it often puts him out of position and leaves the rest of the defense trying to switch which means a lot of open 3 pointers. `\How do you mean by an identity in this context?`\No green, Patty or Diaw tho, I like our chances but don't take anything for granted `\Spurs, please tire the Clippers out for tomorrow, thanks!`\Spurs 1 of 15 from 3, yeesh`\lmaoooo

`\Nice second half the Spurs had. Playoffs once again! `\I can't shake that this game will be closer than I want it to be - we need to break the streak and win against NO.`\Reminds me of the young George Hill vs Parker debate.  Oh well.  We are lucky to have Parker `\He Thundergunned the shit out of that!`\Pop probably experimenting or sumhing`\is okay <3`\>I just noticed that the Cleveland Browns are **8-56.**

FTFY :'(`\Holy shit y'all need to quit bitching about people saying Kawhi's a system player last year. There's a reason everyone fucking hates us`\He hasn't been useful since starting against the Thunder in the playoffs 2 years ago to bring Surge out of the paint. Maybe Pop is thinking he will need to repeat this strategy when the 2nd round comes around but I don't trust Bonner to hit the shots required this time.`\More importantly was this home or away game. Is the spurs home record still going?`\The key is limiting turnovers. They also have to hit those open shots. if they go as cold as they did against OKC, I'm not sure they can sustain those huge runs GSW throws in. The key is slowing the other guys more than Curry. You can't really stop him, but you can stop others, within reason. `\all of us hornets fans were saying this is embarrassing earlier`\It is for us`\it's not luck if we kick your ass overtime you play us`\It show dominance `\Lol`\That big guy is so sweaty holy fuck lol`\theyve played awesome D `\He might have even started ahead of Kawhi his rookie year. Getting him would have likely kept us from trading Richard Jefferson for Stephen Jackson (hopefully we still would've gotten rid of RJ for someone useful). I would've purchased a number 15 Carter Spurs Jersey in a heartbeat. Blame Cuban. Also wouldn't be surprised if Vince harbors some resentment towards SA with the scuffles he had with Bowen years back. `\He was being praised earlier in the season by Pop and others for his improved defense, though like the rest of the team, he's taken a step back defensively. `\Because logic........`\hahahaha ESPN making jokes about Pop's interviews hahaha omg he like doesn't say anything hahahaha`\I remember Bill and Sean talking about it while Manu was still out. The time was great for Patty because he got to work as the primary ball handler and that was having a positive effect on his decision making skills. And decision making is a big deal; it's why we dropped a young, promising guard in McCallum to make room for the aging Andre Miller.

I know Tony has been in a slump recently but I'm not going to act like he didn't save our asses on several occasions this year. Yet with that being said, I would like Patty to play more minutes running the offense with the starters so he could increase that aspect of his game. There's a reason why our bench suffered without Manu. Patty isn't there yet, but at this point he's going to need more experience to reach that next level. `\with that said the spurs have nothing to worry about we will take this L with pride`\It seems either the pass or Danny's catch was a bit off.`\nah i mean instructions on how to get the live stream started, i've never used it before`\lmao`\He's got the confidence now! I like it. No more hesitation`\Words can't describe how much my heart sank seeing "Kawhi Leonard will not return..." in my alerts. Glad it sounds like it's not serious.`\at least someone got the joke`\its times like these that i wish they just let Kevin Martin loose. if he can be 50% of the offensive weapon that he was last year, tht would be huge`\Are you fucking shitting me?`\Holy FUCK Kawhi.`\Wait, wasnt it a bit non Kawhi like (or non Spurs like in general)  for him to take 2 bad make or break shots late in the game?`\Dont you have lottery picks to look up or something?`\That was a joke call. A prank call.`\He's great. The real tragedy though was when Denari called Kawhi the best 3 point shooter in the league...`\How dare you!`\You are now shadowbanned `\Nothing dirty about enlightened self-interest.`\Nice dunk by LMA`\Pop needs to do something with this bench going. And why was nothing set up for Kawhi this entire game?`\lmao yeah `\Kanter didn't have to hesitate initially. `\Boban played the Summer League for the hawks in 2013 but yeah no one seem to notice it.`\Danny Green actually leads us in +/- lmao`\overall is a vaguely defined term, but based on my definition I'd say Steph. But I don't see why best two-way player has to mean the same thing.

This is a crude and vague system of explanation, but I think it gets at the typical usage of the two terms, even if it's not quite right. Imagine you have Player A and Player B. Player A's offensive value is in 99th percentile of NBA players and whose defensive value is in the 1st percentile, but his offensive value is so far above that of the next best player that it doesn't matter how bad he is on defense, he is still the most valuable. That's the best player.

Now imagine a Player B. Player B, while he doesn't excel on offense at the level of that first player I mentioned, is amazing on both ends. Say 97th percentile on both offense and defense. But despite the fact that he's awesome on both ends, his overall value between the two doesn't overcome the offensive greatness of Player A to make him the overall best. However, there's no other player that combines his excellence on both ends of the floor. That's the best two-way player.

We can discuss whether the distinction *actually* makes sense, but in the vague world of NBA player comparison, these are the kinds of unconscious thoughts that people have that differentiate those two titles.`\:(`\Courtney did a fantastic job on Parker, there's a height mismatch and his hustle on defense is very good for his size as he can guard most guys from Parker to Lebron.  It's also the reason why Courtney is a starter instead of Lin because they need more defense to compliment Kemba's offense.`\Burn the heretic!  `\DvE`\stream anyone?`\Thanks Hornets, we needed that.`\Westbrook still has another year on his contract, but if Durant leaves, maybe he demands a trade. `\I support this.`\Too bad the pacers couldn't cancel the trade once they figured out who the spurs wanted to draft.`\The best home record ever was 40-1 by Boston. Their one loss was to Portland.

Portland has warriors and spurs in the next 5 days. Fear!`\When Tim Duncan is your leading scorer in 2016, you know your not shooting well...`\The last time San Antonio Spurs lost at home was Jan. 6, 2015.

Their opponent? Detroit Pistons, 105-104

It's not about your ability to eyeball so much as it is just about volume of games. No doubt Lin has plenty of great games, but he also has lots of bad ones.  Ultimately he's get the minutes he deserves which is quite a bit. He's by far our most involved bench player and is often in the game for long stretches. `\If they intend on playing him for more than 12 minutes per game then probably not. You are wearing rose-tinted shades if you think Lin is happy warming the bench. I feel like it's common knowledge at this point that Lin does better with more playtime and responsibilities.`\He can get much better still! He is at peak physical condition but his mental game is still improving. He's only 24! Give him 4 more years under Pop's tutelage and he's gonna be one smart player. His playmaking/passing will certainly improve imo. `\It never left.

Nice `\The game was over, but that was also some very friendly timekeeping on that last possession`\If you want we will trade you Barnes for Davis yah?!`\Jeremy Lin > Cthulhu`\LMA`\Wow.... I actually feel bad Charlotte`\The Spurs bench is stacked tbh, they can go 10 or 11 deep with quality players `\Redick's hop is so beautiful`\LA A STR8 BEAST`\Heat fans?`\Lin came out here to ball tonight. Holy fucking shit. I have always love this guys and wish him nothing buy success.`\I don't get why Jrue Holiday is not starting`\I'm still amazed that we have Tobias Harris on our team`\Norris Cole has more shot attempts than Davis. That does sound like Cole.`\Harden: So you guys wanna go party after this?`\dont ruin his fun lol`\:(`\I knew it was bad but 5-45? Wew lad.`\Danny found it. `\I can see Lin on the Spurs in the future.`\Manu groin trouble? `\https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWzm2zBLZys`\UP BY TWO`\I'd love to have heard what he said to them after the Hornets loss. I bet he just gave them the silent treatment and they just started picking up dumbells and curling them, running, looking back at him for some confirmation.....but he just stared at them in disgust. PLEASE JUST YELL AT US OR SOMETHING. WE CAN'T TAKE IT ANYMORE.`\No lie me too. Like he was a Spurs vet on a farewell tour or something. I liked it`\yeah I settled for a Pelicans stream`\Yeah but I'd rather be healthy for playoffs tbh`\ET NEEDS TO TURN THEM SLIDERS DOWN`\"You can't be honest on television anymore"`\No! I will not be reminded of ray allen and his Jesus shot!

BANGGGGG for danny greens finals record three point barrage `\Guy yelled "JEREMY" and Lin noticed he lost his guy haha`\We're missing 5 people mang`\Clipper bench us getting roasted`\One of our worst games and its tied. I'll take it. `\Did you just tune in? It's been terrible both ways.`\No you.`\oh god`\George just leaned into Kawhi. Fuck that`\this game is over...the Spurs fucked up playing through the motions after going up big and now it's going to be impossible to get back in rhythm. The Spurs just can't make up any ground on the Warriors. The Warriors lose and then the Spurs shit the bed per par.`\8-74 would be the worst record in NBA history.`\Playing good ball, that's how.`\Because its the NBA`\That sprewell/robinson commercial is hilarious`\man i missed this bc i bounced from the game once westbrook stuffed that dunk in our face. was basically game over at that point. but i remember seeing an infographic of players that heat check upon receiving a technical and westbrook's pt diff is huge when he gets T'd up. look it up.`\Sunset jerseys are dope`\4 points by spurs plays not named Kawhi.`\I wonder what the oldest lineup ever is, can't be much older than that`\Kawhi owns the Clippers`\How could anyone miss him?`\thanks`\Fucking Austin rivers is the king of stepping out of bounds`\I think first round exits are reserved for teams with records like 34-26. `\nah, im in them often and you guys are over the top from the norm tonight `\We had those fans at times, it happens with any winning team. You get people that only pay attention when they are winning.`\That blocking fouls getting called on the Spurs but not on the Pelicans, good game nevertheless, Jrue :(`\I'll try not too with my busy Wednesday night schedule.`\Ugh no thank you. That's going to be such a long and "complain to the refs" kind of game. `\:3`\Wtf. Up by 19?? When did that happen? I've been watching this whole game. It feels so slow. `\Spoiler alert: He's not going to. We've been waiting for him to pick it up for half a year now. He's a bitch on offense and we just have to accept it. `\I thought about not watching the NBA forever after the hardship I went through last year...`\anyone have a decent stream?`\Towns is great.`\Ray is better than Farmar. `\You copy pasted this? Come on, dude.`\Danny green boxed out kd for a rebound lol`\Danny just dunked!!!`\Oh so it has to do with when they're waived and not when they sign? I thought it was the other way around. Thanks. TIL. `\Lol they won't `\Both sides`\Thats because the Lakers have the GDPOAT, Huertas. Next year, Huertas will sign the 50 year 200 billion dollar deal he deserves with the 76ers, turning the 76ers into a dynasty and solidifying the Legacy of Hinkie`\I would add Serge Ibaka's talent to the list. `\fucking monstars`\*Monsta Ellis`\haha now we know who his real father is`\wait, aren't the Cs jostling with also with the hornets for east seedings?????`\I LOVE YOU JEREMY LIN`\Something about your shooting coach just makes guys with big hands good`\Boban going for 20 in 6 minutes`\You mean the players designed to make Austin look playable? `\Poné huevos, narigón.`\I don't know why they don't have a can't catch a fucking ball turnover instead of just a bad pass turn over

I wish Kanter would get a chance to close a game

`\damn hot cheetos are too good tho`\Holy Moly!`\LET SLOWMO COOK`\I really just want to see them 1 on 1, first to 21.`\30!`\I couldn't deny how tough McCollum was last night. I knew he was good but damn.`\Tony Brothers`\Ah okay`\I was thinking we would lose but only by like 8... pls not like this spurs.`\4TH QT meltdown, Turnovers galore. Iso ball. What is going on with OKC. `\what Danny did to KD was equally as impressive IMO. It'll get overshadowed by his terrible shooting but what a defensive performance.`\It's pretty funny how I could guess lol. He's been inactive for like a month now though. `\Miller needs to go back in.`\In all seriousness, the fact that we helped out Charlotte actually makes me happy.`\Melo also forced them to trade their entire starting 5 to Denver for some reason, instead of just waiting till free agency and signing with the Knicks. He literally screwed himself, making the knicks give up a crap ton for him and leaving them with no supporting cast. If he had just waited, he wouldve had a excellent supporting cast and NY would have been a contender for years.

Plus, what team would want an overweight, selfish, aging former-star who had not shown the ability to be a team player?`\What the fuck? This the same team they held to 7 1stQ?`\NO CHILL`\Spurs world problems`\Always go local. Except the Rockets. Those commentators are the worst. `\He dropped the shoulder man!`\Angry Manu is best Manu. `\Players named "Green" are just lighting it up from three.`\Jeremy Lin always drops buckets on the Spurs. He had 38 a few years back.`\LINSANE`\Lol, fair excuse.`\Spurs will win unless CP3 puts up 40+.`\Oh Manu,  Tim screen for the three,  Take the shot!!!!!`\I like the cut of your jig. `\BUNCH OF CHEATERS

edit: im just repeating what the dude behind the broadcasters is drunkenly shouting `\Gotta get the starters some rest sometime lol`\Bleep this team. I can't wait to see them go down in the second round.

They'll go down as the most overrated 60+ win team ever.`\JEREMY LIN! `\8 point lead just wow`\What the hell was that, lol`\Good hustle DJ`\yeah Norm is way better`\It's just people that only pay attention to his 3-pointers being off, and forget that he does a lot more for the team.`\Patty "steph curry" Mills`\We used to have like 3 more games played than the Dubs, now we're equal.`\looks like Westbrook is heating up`\Some terrible calls on the Pistons too. Regardless off the outcome we are not playing well but these refs blow.`\Nah. They only have 2 reasonable, dependable scorers and the role players aren't good enough to make up the difference. any team with Kyle Singler, Nick Collison and Randy Foye in the rotation has a talent problem`\WHO WHAT WHEN WHERE KAWHI`\DAGGER KAWHI`\Oh definitely. We're gonna rest players, but as long as the guys playing that day are playing with intensity it'll be great. I think you're gonna see us working really hard on that defense that we employed against GSW. We'll do a lot more switches than usual to prep, I think.`\We can ask the opposite question lmao`\Go Spurs Go`\Horrible officiating this game so far. So many wrong or missed calls. `\which game is this?`\Simmons might have to go back to the D league after that block`\Depends how deep it is, out a week or two probably`\I think Lance hurt his nuts.`\The Pacers almost didn't do the trade because they liked Kawhi so much and didn't expect him to be there at 15.`\This has been a pretty good game!`\WE DID IT!!!`\Stop all this Anderson on Anderson crime.

Also I love lineups with no Kawhi or LMA, reminds me so much of the lineup that helped lose Game 6. `\LET KAWHI COOK`\Kawhi Leonard, brutalizing the Heat thus far`\Refs making some questionable calls this quarter `\What is this song?`\Our slow starts are what kill us. Probably the one thing you can't do against GS`\tim got hacked `\LOL typical westbrook...complains and not get back`\He played amazing defense overall, and did a great job on KCP, offense was terrible though`\seriously, what is up with Kevin Martins shooting form???`\No, not at all. Biggest weakness in his game is low freethrow rate.`\Wow`\LINSANITY > Curry`\Live and die by the *GINOBILI*`\Oh god I hope so he'd be perfect with us. PERFECT I SAY!!! <3`\How much better can he get? Are you kidding me? He can improve his passing, he can start taking more shots, only taking 15 and still averaging over 20, great efficiency, he is not on his peak yet, this is his first year of being an offensive first option when he gets more experience he can be better.`\Sean Elliott is really getting into this game. `\When Derrick gets to the finals 5 times in a row like lebron, he can start calling the plays. `\Spurs trying to stay the 2 seed. Dodge the Clippers in round 2 `\Lol did you really like just compare Diaw to Durant `\Clippers got totally outplayed in the fourth quarter, but they also couldn't hit anything and the Spurs became unconscious. Can't play anything less than an A+ game to beat an all-time team that's undefeated at home, though.

Come back soon, Blake.`\PATTY MILLS WITH NO FUCKING CHILL`\Danny is back to icyHOT. `\good thing Lin is carrying the shit out of them then :D`\Coolio? Next its gonna be krayzie bone were gonna have an all braids performance `\Damn, Grizz bringing it. Imagine this team with Randolph and Gasol`\Tony Parker is getting buried on screens. Resulting to help way more often. `\That dog at halftime was lit`\If we don't win games that we're supposed to like that nuggets game we won't get third seed.`\That many people shadowbanned on this particular game thread? Could be a spam-bot or something I guess, just seems kinda random/off.`\Wheres the big ABC broadcast game`\Hahaha I was in Texas before I turned 5, but I totally agree.`\:D`\And weirdly racist too. It seems entirely based on his nationality `\What's wrong with Kemba and Williams.`\That finish by Ellis was so nice!`\I love you so much, David West. Holy shit`\Not always. Against Spurs, though, for sure.`\He will never be back `\"oh you know just playing good defense. Teammates made good passes and got some open looks. found my rhythm"`\God Reggie Miller is soo annoying`\I mean, when you pander to a certain crowd you're bound to make money.`\Keep grinding, Memphis. You're still a big part of keeping Houston out of the playoffs this year lol`\Spurs were like "You thought the Warriors played like shit?? Watch this!"`\Your front office is the antithesis of the bulls FO`\Don't talk shit about the GOAT haircut `\He hasn't exactly gotten by on athleticism or basketball skill, always been a high iq guy, and if I'm rememberijg correctly, he has some extensive business background. Could very easily transfer over into an analytical or scouting role, hell I'd say coaching if we didn't already have a full team of coaches. `\We love our announcers, I'm not paying too much attention to the game but I'm assuming Quinn said it. He says dumb shit sometimes`\OH HELL NOOOOOOOO`\What an amazing game. Kawhi is incredible `\You really think the rockets are winning 22 more games?`\Great stuff it's a game.`\This is amazing, Hornets come back after being down by 21 points in the first quarter.`\sigh home team fouls...`\getting separation`\PATTY THRILLS`\I mean it's one more championship. Over 20 years it can be washed out by other factors. `\BUZZ BUZZ FUCK BOIS`\Let's see how Kanter does against Boban, it'll be a good test of his defense`\I feel like we got blown out by 50.  That was fucking pathetic.

Hats off to Jeremy Lin though, straight owned us.`\RIP 2013-2014 Danny Green`\pls come back lin`\I have a little home gym in my garage and I am always kicking shit in there. I feel your pain!!!`\I think Gentry agrees`\Sliding by that charge attempt was a thing of beauty.`\Can we stop leaving guys open in the perimeter pls`\Gonna need Aldridge to have a big game. Should be fun as fuck to watch.`\;)`\OKC can keep the 3 seed plz.  I do not wanna see Manu.`\Yes but the main thing Pop has been hammering into him all season is consistency.

Superstars are superstars because they play the way Leonard did tonight every night, for the whole season, for season after season after season. He can't ever let up because this Spurs team can't win it all unless he plays like this every night, and his responsibility to the team is only going to increase when Duncan and Manu inevitably retire.`\Chris Paul is a god`\FUCK!!! We didn't win by 25. God damn it bench :(`\that'd suck`\the amount of rotation on Leonards shot is ridiculous lol`\I'm at work so I've only been able to look at the box score, what the hell happened in that second quarter?`\Monta Ellis is the greatest spur killer to ever play this game and the Spurs just don't have anywhere near the luck that Golden State does in these kinds of games.`\One way or another, I see a 7 game series between us in the future.`\Some games i find impossible to see clippers even winning their first round with that horrid bench unit. But then i see cp3 and remind myself of blake... And they can beat anyone as long as bench isn't too bad. `\They were getting outplayed, you cant win shooting 35% from the field. However, the refs were pretty bad.`\As much as the Spurs would want to credit the whole team for the win, Duncan's defense in the last 3 minutes was unbelivable.`\"My team counts on me to make the three ball."-Danny Green`\get em son`\Spurs having trouble in transition`\Forearm shiv mid court no call rofl`\Spurs scouts should be banned `\LOL DANNY GREEN`\Rather see Diaw in this lineup rather then Slo Mo.`\time for some nasty clutch!`\you forgot the 'the end'`\Wheeeeeeee!`\Stan needs to chill. It's been over for 2 minutes`\Diaw with the bolo tie tonight`\Come on man, we played up to the Spurs, not you guys.`\He fucked my bitch in some New Balance flip flops.`\DAE SPURS OLD?! LOLOLOL!`\Got an example of that first part? And it's almost like there's more than one Spurs fan in this thread, and those fans may not hold the same attitude towards tonight's game.`\Dick...`\as I've said on our sub, they didn't look like they got over themselves.`\keep whining spurs`\Wesbrook should get the Spurs game ball`\Hah!  Why not, Birdman.`\Beautiful.`\Idk the numbers but god its terrible.`\Contusion just means a bruise.`\https://vine.co/v/iOUFQpiimju`\Warriors fans (and team) have to be pretty pissed right now, but if the Spurs didn't blow it last night, they'd only be 1 win behind the Warriors.

2 wins behind is still pretty close, but I'm just imagining the #1 seed coming down to the last couple of games, even though the Warriors are fucking 56-6`\KAWHI WEONARD`\Age comes fast, I miss old Tony :(`\/u/DonnieNarco?`\Pay for cable and you get your own announcers all the time. Problem solved! `\oh`\The Pacers have had so many close games since all-star break`\The refs need to let the players play in this one. A lot of ticky tacky calls it feels like`\Timmy is the best player in NBA history!

I'm actually serious about this one too`\Payne's playing pretty good D, kept to his man, didn't get caught in screens and good rotations.`\Spurs shooting 11/44`\Lmao. This defense though...`\He never gets  the chance,i bet he could keep up with everyone he's 7'3 with great shooting skills,good speed for that height and keen intellect for plays.I would compare him with Divac,maybe even better but he is not getting minutes to prove that.Even against Miami he only got 14...`\LMA  OHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH`\he has one of the worst demeanor's of any pro i've seen. thought he didn't have to work hard just because of his draft position

`\Ever since 2011, Spurs haven't treated the Grizz too nicely. `\Good to see the clips bench is still trash lol`\i understand, but really at this point if we want martin we have to cut someone, and miller seems the most expendable. (of the bottom 5 boban/simmons/miller/butler/bonner, i wouldn't cut any of the other 4 to get martin)`\Magic? Bird? He's just outside my top 5 personally.

Number 6 or 7 depending on who I'm talking to and just ahead of Kobe.`\We've held the Hawks to 13 twice this year in the 1st quarter. `\Cmon Gernobli`\Holy shit did Bonner get a block on Westbrook?`\They've scored more points than the Thunder`\Al?! Please. That is over paying. We'll give them Hawes. Even then, it's not even.`\I can't believe some of y'all still don't like Zach even though he's gotten so much better.`\They thought 2014 was revenge for game 6?

How cute.

THE RIDE NEVER ENDS MOTHERFUCKER, ASK THE GRIZZLIES`\I couldn't believe how disappointing that game was. Even though I wanted the Warriors to win, it felt like such a letdown. `\I could win in San Antonio `\Maybe if you stop saying such stupid shit, then I'll stop being sarcastic. Our problem is turnovers, so we should have kept the guy who is on pace to DESTROY the league record for turnovers. Got it. That makes beautifully perfect sense. Let's also blame them for the injuries too. Fucking idiot Sam Presti, why did he let KD break his foot? `\Excuse me?`\Yeah, he's been ice cold from three in 3/4 of the previous games.`\Bench `\No, but I don't believe we can come back this far how we're playing. I'll watch though.`\Lincest

.

.

Wincest`\WHAT A PASS, WHAT A 3! PATTY THRILLS!!`\Spurs and 0.4 again`\Damn, no one can win shooting like that. GG pacers.`\MR FRESH`\Why won't y'all let us in on sum dat 1st seed`\Dude tried to break Kawhii's arm earlier this season. That didn't get called but 2 technical fouls later he finally got ejected. There's never a bad time to remind everyone to fuck Zaza.`\I would be mad if i was a rocket fan too :/`\I was wondering what that huge uproar of cheering was, then I realized that Boban got subbed in.`\Dick`\Can we please get our 3 point shooting back?`\TY LAWSON FIND GODNEY!`\i'd like to agree with you right now, but i'm still saying fuck to those crazy GSW 3s that win you games`\gdamn simmons!`\[LMA this game](http://i.imgur.com/2EklznV.jpg)`\Anyone got the gif of Adreian Payne's huge dunk`\Yeah no way around it's embarrassing

Its a no win situation, like fighting a girl.

If we win: You played the bench, why didn't they win by more?

If they lose: OKC sucks and won't go far in the playoffs! Probably won't make it out of the 1st! Bye Durant!`\Seven points in the first quarter. SEVEN!`\reminds me of the 2014 finals`\other than that span i don't think its even been tat bad RELATIVE to what we've been seeing recently`\Nah we played great actually`\This music lol`\Go best the Warriors, Spurros`\Okay..`\Jeremy F'n Lin. An amazing comeback by the Hornets, GG. Make some noise in the playoffs!`\Yeah his whining is insane that's for sure`\It feels like Monta never has a bad game against the spurs....`\All credit to them and the rest of the Grizz tonight. Played a great game given the circumstances. `\We challenge you to a seven game series! >:)`\We Hornets fans prefer you say "beelieve."`\Rose still missed, so I don't know what your point is. /u/Lolq123 was arguing that Rose is back, and highlighting missed layups isn't very good evidence to support his claim. `\Mainly they take care of business, and Pacers play LeBron.`\Yeah he seems to be getting burned by high pick and rolls. He can't move laterally as fast as he used to thats for sure.`\Who did the spurs let go to pick up KMart? I thought Bonner was the one to be released, yet, there he is..`\Yeah if he can't score he's useless.`\it's one of those nights`\I mean he's from the Bay Area.`\can I just say that this is the most beautiful post-game thread format I've ever seen

full stats and game summary, links to nba.com and espn, the works. A+, kudos`\Brooklyn can't take Messina fast enough. What an absolute horrid coaching job on top of really terrible games by a lot of guys.`\Oh I love Mills, I hope my comment didn't presume I thought Patty was a scrub.`\Honestly, I don't really see the warriors having too much issue with them. That's probably unpopular, but I feel like the warriors will match up well with them. I also foresee the death squad running train if the spurs play 2 bigs at the end. `\Lamb's been struggling for a while though, I remember someone trying to kick him off for more Daniels minutes.`\BoBo doesn't understand how y'all can live like animals like that.`\Currently q`\Sorry, I just get so frustrated watching up play this team. I just don't get it. They're not that great, but they've been fucking us over the past 2 years.`\Talking about defensive/winning mentality stuff. I was hoping he'd be our locker room Perk that doesn't play. It doesn't seem like he's having much of an effect at all.

But hell, maybe that shit takes time. Maybe he's laying into everyone RIGHT NOW. That would be amazing. `\Myles Turner has an...interesting...hairdo.`\hhooooly`\good defense and 3 point shooting. more than bonner

regardless this is a good problem to have `\This game went from close game to a blowout real quick. `\His offensive inconsistency is a very hot topic of debate in Pistons areas. `\I guess I understand what the warriors felt like yesterday. 4/28 from 3 is abysmal and 1/7 from Kawhi is surprising.`\Yep!  Our "teribble whiny" announcer even called that.  `\And to be frankly honest with you, to the refs`\That was clean damn`\Spoopy Spurritos`\Russ is insane`\Kyle looking more confident`\[BECAUSE IF IM CRYING SO SHOULD SPURS FANS](http://gifrific.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Ray-Allen-Hits-Three-to-Force-OT-Game-6-NBA-Finals.gif)`\He really is a fuckin Spurs killer.

They showed highest scorers against Spurs last couple years and he's up there in the top 5 with Blake Griffin and Kevin Durant`\Danny Green sounds really concerned about the well being of potential customers in that car dealership ad.`\Because BOBAN TIME BOBAN GOAT RIP OTHER TEAM`\Way to step up Kyle Anderson! Those steals and boards are so important.`\Did AD shuffle his feet or was it just me?`\Looked like it was just one foot.`\damit i thought it was the rivers rim check`\That was coooooooooooooold-blooooooooooooded.`\Most people don't like Rick renner.

Time to grandpa dick these youngbloods.`\Good drop off or bad?`\Ever since AD left they have been heading their shots.`\That's gotta be a nightmare. "Oh fuck, he's backing up. Oh fuck, he's running at me." Swish.`\The refs making you shoot 3-22 from three too?`\To add, it's a very very useless stat without heavy context.`\Bulls hitting everything. Mainly rose`\lmao worst ft% in nba history`\Time to fuck shit up. GSG`\Great game Hornets. Building a very good team in Charlotte.`\I'd like to think the answer to most questions like this is Smitch but /shrug.  We need a scapegoat.`\Yeah I figured Daredevil S2 would contain plot elements from JJ.`\That box score is a typo, right?`\I'd say about 3. Wouldn't call it plenty, but it was the old slashing Rose that we all miss.

The rest came off pretty good picks, I think. He made those jump shots hell for Rose, though. `\Monta have it all! However, these refs are terrible both ways`\It's basically just a bruise, we'll probably rest him on Friday`\Well obviously. TP **used to** be one of the top PGs before. But now CP3 can shut him down and score on him. Other point guards could score on him but Parker can still go back the other way and score on them. If Spurs play clips in the playoffs, Patty should be their main PG`\IS THERE A MERCY RULE IN THE NBA JESUS`\Okay`\I laughed ��`\bang`\I don't understand how the Clipper's bench manages to suck so much every year`\JAM-michael Green?! awesome name `\Rasual Butler :(`\HOW`\It's probably going to go to Donkey ��`\lol? he's been fantastic.`\Our 2 stars coming in big`\Patty Thrills`\We can all lament Parker's heroball or Manu's bad passes, but just be glad that our starting point guard isn't Jordan Farmar`\I already love Andre. Passing is on point. `\i honestly get sad watching OKC play now`\Good on Donovan for calling the time out, that's unacceptable.`\It boggles my mind how players can sprint full speed halfway across the court and turn around and shoot the ball in under a second at such high accuracy. That shit is unreal.`\david west is GOAT PF in the 4th Quarter of close games. `\At this point, even a traffic cone would be more productive than he is. `\Lincoming linsanity!!!`\After a few blunts, Jr and Lin could look like they related. `\Didn't get to catch anything but the end of the game. Dear lord, the way they turned it up at the end was beautiful. So pumped about this team. `\As long as the Spurs keep pretending every team is GSW and playing with that intensity, I'm fine with it, lol.`\damn, Spurs getting sloppy here`\*GINOBILI!*`\Just gotta practice dribbling the ball with some control. I find that small touches and possession end up being more successful, especially if you communicate with your team on when you're gonna center the ball`\lol pop chewing out boban`\is lin the new reggie jackson??`\Down 5 without blake against a full strength spurs squad?  I'm not even mad`\How many times did you assholes refresh`\BOBAN!!`\Seriously? Wow what a loser.

San Antonio always has shots of the Alamo, Riverwalk, and Maricahe bands. JVG talking about getting Mexican food. Why would you show normal stuff that every city has? These are the things that set us apart and should be celebrated. `\you flappy headed bastard `\we really needed him for Leanard.`\There he is.`\He seriously is the ideal Spurs player`\Anyone interested in hardcore henry?`\Not trying to overreact or anything but Lin > Curry.`\Maybe he should go try /r/funny, they like shitty jokes.

Besides Kanter is likely to win 6moy you can't really call him shit `\Not all Pacers fans, but I love him.`\Pls, I can only have so many heart attacks`\Dude is also blazing fast`\HOLY FUCK BONNER HAS BEEN SPOTTED`\Slomo needs to stop passing up wide open shots. It's bad for the team if nobody respects his shot.`\Take notes kiddos. The Professor has arrived.`\Tell me, if Steph Curry shoots a 3 from the right corner, is he most likely going to hit or miss?

Is 51.4% greater than 50%?

I'll tell you again.

click on Shot Zones.

It says 51.4% in the top right.

Don't talk to me until you actually look at the chart.


Also,
Steph Curry made 69% of his 3's from the left corner last season. (40/58)

`\Pacers playing some serious D`\Can't do that grab and shove/pull stuff RIGHT in front of the ref Monta.  Well, unless you play for the Warriors. `\Timmy with that "I'm disappointed" look`\Westbrook is really good`\Best 2 point shooting team in the league.`\lol`\We should all pitch in and get him a life alert `\Amen!`\I'm done.`\He really needs to hit those jumpers consistently to be good...`\Hot dang`\Spurs threw away this game`\Mirotic when it counts.`\109 if you include the whole team`\Wasn't Manu playing like crap for a whole year too?

He may not be hitting 3s consistently but as least he's doing everything else.`\pop untying patty's shoe for him :')`\oh shiiiit viiiince`\Boban time!!`\How many layups has Kawhi missed in the last two games? `\the pacers picked him because the spurs told them to...why does no one get this`\lmao so true; salty warrior fans are salty `\Tony's floaters count as defensive stats`\Sans the Heat and Clippers games, Danny Green is 5-45 on three's this month...... Stolen from Spurs talk.

Pretty crazy stat considering almost all his 3's are wide open.
`\I plan to!

If OKC can't win it all, I wouldn't mind at all for you guys to. Or Dallas for Dirk, but that's probably not going to happen`\Fuck it. Buying a Mills jersey asap `\....that's who I was talking about`\Aldridge is looking more and more like Duncan`\better pull a rabiit out of that hat and beat the warriors plz lol`\Buzz Buzz bitches we are coming for you 3rd seed`\\#basedrefs probably`\Jeremy Lin is just our Kryptonite.`\Shit missed the first part. Why dd Pop say we have to play smarter?`\LMA is a pretty solidly above Klay in my opinion, though I am, obviously, quite biased on the subject.`\so how about getting the ball to that AD guy? heard he is pretty good`\The bench looked pedestrian without manu, notice how they went on runs when Kawhi was out and immediately when Kawhi was in we cut the lead down `\Loss number 11!`\lol, second time Rivers did it`\This season has been amazing. It's fucking ridiculous that Golden State might break the 72 win mark, and that they might have to to keep the 1st seed over the Spurs. `\I love me some Blaha and Special K, but a switchup is nice, and these guys are actually talking about the Pistons. `\damn 99' are about 16-17 y/o now!!!`\Legitimate question, would you rather have the current situation with Carmelo or would you rather have tried to build a team around Lin?`\BO-BAN MAR-JAN-O-VIC
clap, clap, clapclapclap`\Kawhi is so fun to watch `\He's an LSU Tiger, so makes sense`\He should have 3`\Spurs,you better win by 6`\It's the same as somebody throwing a softball at us normals`\Basically, there are few teams that can beat the Spurs when their shot isn't ice cold. Their defence is almost always solid, and their offensive execution is beginning to gel. `\Ah yes. My fellow Spurs fans are feeling the distain I feel about Parker every other game `\that's 3 west playoff calibre teams down. Let's see how we do against the basketball god `\Everyone wins if they can use bats.`\He should really be chucking that shit around 7 seconds, like MVP-candidate Westbrook.`\I fucking hate that shit lol `\But since benches are also part of the game one could say that this game was in reach`\TIMMY WHAT THE FUCK! `\Damn Thunder are so stacked we have to resort to the 2 fucking assistant coaches to make up an excuse.  `\We got Bonner!  Nothing can stop us!`\Pacers announcers just called Ginobili "sloth-like"?`\the Rockets and Thunder aren't terrible `\Yeah, it's rough. Slomo, Danny Green, and even Patty Mills (unless he's spot-up shooting) are unable to create their own shots. This is also why Mills can't be a replacement for Tony Parker.`\Dude I would be so pissed if I bought tickets and was a nola fan.`\March Kawhi is simply a top 5 player IMO.

Aldridge is now comfortable.

Just need Manu back and Parker/Green to get some form of consistency and we're good to go.`\Hopefully he keeps it up come playoff time. `\God damn grizzlies ty for blessing us with this man`\Tim is pissed`\pistons gonna make the playoffs?`\All you people doubting Green haha`\People can talk about this team's potential all they want, but until we start to play a shred of defense, we're not going to win many games. `\Thank god I didn't buy tickets for this game`\It looks good. Interesting idea`\Lol, what a sequence `\This announcer is garbage.`\Yeah.

LMA would be a top 10 player if they moved the three point line in like some people are suggesting though.`\I'm ashamed of this`\Gg happy easter`\"It's just not been a good shooting year for Danny Green"`\WHERE THE POPA-DOMINATION BEGAN `\Downvote this guy as much as you can. He is classless.`\Manu Ginobli being out for a while and the Spurs D dropping a bit back to earth from the earlier historic levels has made the games closer and has tightened up the rotations a bit`\Reddick is terrific. Their top 4 guys are as good anybody's in the league (the best IMO). It's their 5-10 guys that hold them back. `\I think the Lakers will trade for him`\Yeah I get what you're saying. To be fair though I don't think harden is on the level of Chris Paul, that dude is historically good at taking care of the ball, it's hardly a comparison. `\Am i the only one who thinks okc has a loaded roster?`\Kawhi is love kawhi is life`\you're a lucky man`\I'll never get over how goofy looking Kyle Anderson is.`\The Clippers are a tougher matchup especially if Griffin comes back healthy.`\Nah`\Actually his dad has a lethal 5 foot sky hook.`\No, ours. I'm pretty sure it's BD. Cage only gets our white players' names mixed up`\Thanks!`\Literally flipped the switch. Amazing.`\19/37 = 51.4`\What a bailout`\I remember watching West when he was in OKC

`\How so?`\pop where r u `\The playoffs should just be 4 rounds of Spurs vs Warriors. `\They do though, he gets to the line of shot fakes all the time. `\No one called you crazy, that's literally the reason everyone gave for why they lost last year`\Our "starters" can't buy a bucket.`\Not even surprised that happened`\yo anybody got that VLC Link plug?`\Well there goes tying the Bulls record :(`\That just might work.`\Danny green hit 1 3.

`\It's not about this game. It's personal.`\Lmao TAJ`\Kyrie's defense is too much of a liability (seriously, it's ridiculous how bad he is on d) and the drop off from Steph to Klay is too big to put them above the others imo.`\Put in Duncan for Anderson and I think there would be a good chance of that being the oldest lineup in NBA history`\LOL WTF`\Waiting for that Linsanity highlight doe....`\#"Thank you Pacers!" - Warriors fans everywhere`\I will now forever refer to him as Popcorn Gasol.`\It was close, then it wasn't.`\Green makes them threes when we really need it `\You get one of those word of the day calendars for Christmas or what?`\Lin did what Curry couldn't`\I'll take it.`\Most points scored all season coming back from a major injury.

2 not losing at home.

And I'm certain he doesn't care about getting first in the division.   It'd be nice but he knows he can't get it since GS has done so well.   That means he can lose games and not care.   His bench can get more playing time in and get better for the playoffs.  `\what happened to kawhi i didnt see

He scores less, but **FAR** more efficiently. He rebounds about as well, turns it over way less, and is the best defender in the league. He's second only to Steph Curry in RPM and is just below LeBron in PER, despite a much lower usage rate. The only major edge LeBron has is passing, though it is a pretty big edge.

Overall, I'd say they have been of roughly equal value this year. Kawhi's efficiency and defensive prowess are matched by LeBron's volume and passing ability. But there is certainly a case to be made for Kawhi over LeBron, speaking strictly in terms of this year.`\after at least 3 out of bounds balls that were incorrectly called against the pacers it'd be pretty comical if they overturned this lol. every pacer game i watch ends like this!`\May Boban be with you.

Edit: IT WAS NBATICKETS.COM DAAAAAD THEYRE NEVER FAKE DAAAAAD`\Finally reddit is back and i start bitching again`\every time i watch okc vs spurs, David West is unstoppable  `\Pretty sure Kawhi is the best player in NBA history `\As good as Westbrook is, sometimes the individual assets are better than the sum of all parts. In my opinion, Westbrook is not the right PG to pair with Durant.

Coincidentally, this Spurs team is actually a perfect for this illustration because LaMarcus Aldridge, a star in his own right, was and is more than willing to fit in and play within the system even if his individual stats will go down. This has clearly worked for both LaMarcus and the Spurs because if it wasn't for Golden State we would be talking about the Spurs season being one of the best ever.

Durant needs a PG with this mentality and I don't think Westbrook will ever be that type of player. He has that alpha male personality which isn't a bad thing, it just doesn't work well when you have another top 5 player in the league on your team.

That being said, the Raptors (my favourite team) are OKC-lite in terms of how they execute their offence. Kyle Lowry and Demar DeRozan taking turns at ISO so I can't really criticize that much.

What alternative PG do you guys think would work better on OKC?`\Hustle hustle!!!`\Pop willing.`\There's one Friday and Saturday too`\Welp on to the next one. We got the Magic Nets an Lakers next`\everyone and their mother always blames the supporting cast... the game changed when westbrook unnecessarily gambled and left green wide open from 3. sure, west kept the spurs in it to that point, but EVERYTHING went downhill after that deflating shot. kd is my favorite player and i love watching westbrook play and will defend him against all stupid criticism, but these two guys need to start catching heat for their dumb gaffes. two different coaches, several different teammates, and everyone else is still getting blamed.`\Eh, it's not for everybody. I enjoy it because of the limited modding. Not like Lakersground where you get banned for the simplest transgressions.... but you probably have standards and aren't a degenerate like the rest of us on Spurstalk lol`\lol that late ass foul call`\Incoming good jeff green `\Dude is gonna turn into a top 10 player in the league while still on his rookie contract.

Now because we're depleted as hell I have the Grizz all L's for the Spurs (I was right, yaay), GSW twice, Raptors, and Clippers. The remaining 4 games vs the Nuggets, Magic, Bulls, and Mavericks are all winnable, but with our roster I take nothing for granted so I gave em all W/L.

Memphis: Best (win all 50/50 games) 45-37
Split 43-39
Worst (lose everything, this is the darkest timeline) 41-41

Jazz have a pretty ok schedule but they've got ground to cover and two auto losses vs the Spurs and Warriors. I put them with W/L vs the Clippers and the Mavericks, since those are playoff teams looking to stay strong or vie for a spot, as the case may be. Other than that a light schedule of bad western teams.

Utah: Best 43-39
Split 42-40
Worst 41-41

Trailblazers have it pretty tough. They're pretty good so they're the most likely to shit on my predictions, but I have them sure losses to the Heat, Warriors, and Thunder, with a chance to beat the Celtics and the rest wins vs bad western teams. They only have one W/L so it's best/worst.

Portland: Best 43-39
Worst 42-40

Rockets have a damn cakewalk to end the season. Other than sure losses to the Cavs and Thunder, it's mostly win city, closing out with Suns, Lakers, TWolves, and Kings. W/L for the Mavericks game though, since they got that Texas rivalry thing going and that might be a really important game for the standings. With one W/L it's best/worst again.

Houston: Best 42-40
Worst 41-41

Sooooo... What's there to learn? For one, I'm a shitty analyst, there's no percentages or anything pretty or laid out with a pie graph or whatever.

But essentially, if the Grizzlies beat 3/4 of the teams they *should* beat, perhaps Nuggets Magic Bulls wins with a loss to Dallas to fuck over Houston (hehe), then those 44 wins would beat all the other team's best case scenarios, and some sort of upset would have to happen for another team to take the 5th seed.

However, if we collapse and lose everything, there's a pretty good shot we miss the playoffs entirely, since the Jazz and Rockets are also headed towards 41-41 in a *worst* case scenario. Jazz won the season series, we split the games with Houston, unsure how the other tie breakers are right now.`\Timberwolves being part of history again!`\Late to the party boys.

Then he attempts to run these tar-paced offensive sets and before you know it half of a quarter is gone because his execution happens with 8 seconds left on the shot clock.`\I was already concerned about our chances tonight, and then I heard that Pop wasn't going to be there.

Hornets absolutely capatilised on every mistake and miss we made. Incredible effort by them.

Even though their offence was nil in the first; they had the same defensive effort the entire game, that's what I took from the game. We just weren't there tonight mentally and they played an amazing game. I don't think i've ever seen Kawhi and Danny play so badly defensively, they literally looked out of sorts, Kawhi especially. Not to mention the rest of the team no less.


Kudos to Lin man, came out and balled and brought life to his team. Steve clifford was practically calling out all our plays before we made them lol.`\plz no.`\I feel like a huge part of it is mental for him. He had confidence early in the season but seems to have lost it now that the stakes are higher.

Mike Smith can f right off tho.`\I love seeing CP3 lose`\Can someone Eli5 the Barry hate? I love his voice.`\not with those turnovers`\Gotta love OKC defense, help on everything to make sure we're scrambling around because of simple ball movement.  `\Kyle Anderson earned his way into the rotation but he's like the 9th person off the bench...pop loves to work with different lineups...if we did not rest anyone this game I doubt he would get much playing time out of the average he normally gets...he would probably get assigned kd tho`\Patty and Manu gonna come in and light it up. Calling it now.`\This makes 12 losses tho`\He's fine`\Only players who have played thousands of minutes together could make a play like that. `\still got two dubs; the W and the trib dub`\she's really, really pretty. but still, lol.

You're my hero!`\wtf 19 points in 13 min for Boban?

Also pretty ridiculous that Aldridge/Duncan/Parker only scored 17 points combined and yet the Spurs won easily still. The depth of this team...`\That's fair. I loved Bowen, despite all his questionable moments.`\Singler is back playing`\this also feels like the time a Beedrill beat a Steel type`\A lot of Spurs fans get fucking pissed if you mention this. It's like he's above criticism. Look at his stats in March. He's playing like dogshit. Imo, it has to do with his ego. He still wants to be looked at as the main man. He's not unselfish like Tim or Manu. He's unwilling to hand over the reigns to Kawhi, so it shows in his game. But of course, all this is speculation.`\Boban Marjanovic must lead the league in games with more points scored than minutes played.`\Patty mills > Tony parker `\Oh, Jeremy. I see you're doing well.

No, no I'm not crying. I'm happy for you. I'm glad you found someone who treats you nicely.

I'm just staring off into the distance for another reason...`\LOL preach.

Love his game.`\I love it when you call me big Popovich`\Hitting two WIDE open threes! Danny waking up a bit!

WHYYYYYYYYYY`\NOT EVEN CLOSE AMIRITE`\Not on ABC because of competition with March Madness.`\Really Chris?? You ran into Tim who was standing still and you want a foul?!?! Get the fuck out of here you whinny bitch`\LET SIMMO COOK`\Cavs or Rockets getting fucked up. `\Gonna have to agree to disagree here`\Man the Spurs run offense to perfection`\Last night the Spurs had a lineup of Miller, Martin, West, Duncan, and Ginobili out there. Combined age 185. `\I need to watch more mj. I'm noticing more parallels.`\don't see you on /r/fireemblem. it's fun over there.`\lol yeah that was hilarious`\Westbrook was out of bounds the fuck`\Rockin dat old man lineup lmao`\I wish Timmy wasn't the only one going for offensive rebounds. `\No Simmons in garbage time? He seems to have fallen out of favor.... What happened?`\its a blessing and a curse, you get a great basketball team but you also get big ole ladies `\I'm not sure either. `\So we're getting Lebron, Dwade, Melo, and CP3?`\I'm not.`\No goaltend? Ok`\I seriously thought our big guys would overwhelm the Hornets.`\That was pretty bad though. Seven point first quarter and a serious ass kicking happening and you lose? `\Our game threads are always busy. I can't say that for other teams though.`\Parker exposed dames biggest weakness and that's pick and roll defense, LMA got soooo many open shots. Kawhi balled out and patty showed our for his name sake. Great win `\There ya go, Robes!!!`\Pop has had his bad games, too.`\your post history is cancer`\GR3333N`\Trolls homie, all they want is a reaction.`\Going to Austin will help him too like it did with Anderson`\What's with all the airballs Charlotte? `\20-12`\Parker is in now.....uuuuagghhhhhh`\Dammit, Spurs, you had one job`\This is a good competitive game. Pistons quit playing us so damn close!  `\Lose in the wcf and fire the head coach, come on son`\I remember my biggest knock on him was that he was too inefficient for my liking but man did pop fix that now i'll just complain about his tat on the arm.`\It's totally possible to win games this way. I took a basketball class in college for shits, and we had to play a 3v3 Round Robin. All the good dudes teamed up together thinking they were going to steam roll everyone, and they basically did. Except, me and the two other dudes no one wanted... Because all any of us did was play good d, rebound, and hustle. Well, we fucking swept everyone with mind blowing scores of 2-3, 3-5, 4-1, etc (scoring was 1s and 2s). The coach said it was the ugliest most effective basketball he'd ever seen. I was so proud. We literally won one round from a single 3 pointer I made. The other team didn't even score lol. `\Great block from rookie21`\> No fucking way that isn't a record.

It has been spoken already.`\Hello is there a stream for this game

Thank you
`\KAWOW! `\Aka the NBA`\Courtney Lee seems to be really happy here. No matter the state of the game It always seems like his smiling and pumping the team up. I'm glad we picked him up.`\#WHAT THE FUCK JUST HAPPENED? IT'S PARTY TIME BITCHES`\Indeed`\They stole Rob Nice from us`\MON TO THE FREAKING TAY`\Perk do something!`\Love you, man!`\only when we win lol. The poor sport Spurs fans come out en masse when things go sour.`\Don't get your hopes up.`\Garbage just turn it back off.`\Ty Lawson died for this.`\and the last basket of the quarter didn't count, 7 points.`\I remember him hitting a three or two in Miami before`\I was Blake was playing so we'd win easier. `\Linsanity`\Nola looks terrible w/o Davis on the floor`\I guess Kawhi really hates the Heat`\LaSharkus`\i'll take 7 games of this`\I saw that. Danny kept laughing with a bunch of guys on the bench, too, after one of his three's. `\Way to go Hornets.

Nothing makes me happier than a Spurs loss.

Blowing a 20+ pt lead vs. a team they hadn't lost to in eons- glorious.`\Parker with the Ginobili pass. `\I never loved the Hornets this much`\Martin brings nothing new to this team`\You don't have to worry bout that`\Great game. I just got back onto my computer and Windows 10 seems to have taken over. I can't see my desktop and the stupid app layout is forcing itself on me. Anyone have this problem and/or know of a way to go back to the normal desktop?`\And so it begins`\The man is 4/5, lol. You had a pretty funny call on that so far. `\Dat Dog`\We made the list!`\I'm glad I live in Southwest Missouri, this game is being broadcasts on Fox Sports. Take that NBA TV`\Guys this is absolutely Linsane`\Idk what you were trying to say.`\Kawhi is a top 5 player in this league`\Lol this continuation. GG Indy, we played like garbage.`\These back to back threes killed any chance of a comeback. God I just wanted a close game. `\I bought the NBA package from DirecTV, mainly so I would never have to listen to Sean Elliot. I actually enjoy listening to the opposing announcers.`\More like Shaq Kobe `\Spurs won the game by going right at Kendrick Perkins in the pick and roll in the final two minutes`\Don't joke about his coupons. He'll go crazy. `\Kawhi is gonna go for a season high tonight, book it`\nah mane they kept it near`\Join us tomorrow night. It's gonna be a shitshow. `\Bonnnnnerrrrr!`\Patty decided that it's time to take over on both ends`\THE SHOCKMASTER`\Woah

Worse than Rockette fans? Ehhhhh`\little playing time, we didn't ask him to do much`\Report: Monta Ellis arrested Monday night for a large possession of "It All"`\Well they were basically coaching our actual coach, but we still can't keep blowing leads like this. Nobody is blameless
`\i did not think we would get 3's rained on us tonight.`\Because the conversation was:

I feel bad when Danny Green shoots a three because he's probably going to miss.

I point out, half jokingly, that when anyone shoots a three it's probably going to miss.

This isn't that fucking hard to understand you autist.`\Alright, looks like it's time for that classic 3rd quarter run if we want to get back into the game. We look pretty lifeless out there...`\Wow Pacers gonna choke`\Hoiberg drawing up that 12 point play. `\Dante went from attempting 51 3's his whole career to 111 this season.`\Get that butter off the rim wtf`\That would mean the clippers only put up 80?`\I feel like Batum's defense is underrated. `\I won't feel comfortable unless the Spurs are up 20. The Clips always find a way to bounce back.`\And Timmy.`\wow this small ball lineup`\Good game Clipps. `\Fifteen seconds. `\Why would people complain about the refs? At the worst they evenly went against both sides, but I thought they were fine.`\http://i.imgur.com/mgjthfa.png`\Im not blaming them im just saying the NBA is flush right now. I mean LBJ Wade Bosh Pat Riley only won 2/4. They may have won one or two. Maybe. Doubt thats a dynasty.`\she is so overrated on this forum its insane`\Danny Defense was nice`\Lasharkus`\How about the team shooting 11% from 3? Or having a 38% FG%? But yeah, it's the coaching staff's fault. No, let's also ignore we lost 2 assistant coaches. Fuck Monty Williams am I right? Holy shit our fans are annoying. `\Looked at the boxscore after the first quarter and 8/10 Spurs players have recorded an assist`\There's always that one team full of scrubs that shows up against us, giving it their all. Last year it was the Clippers. `\You tell me. His offense has disappeared`\How is having Danny Green fuck up be lucky?

Seems par for the course this season.`\UNLEASH BOBAN`\in VLC just click Media - Open Network Stream. Then paste the stream URL and click play`\Spurs are still gonna win this.`\Bench Green.`\this isnt normal. im pretty sure we're top 8 in defensive rebounding at least`\I think you might be reading into this a bit much. He definitely has a big ego though.`\Still had a coach. And you got outcoached by a dude who tells his players to heave contested jumpers halfway through the clock shot when up by 3 points with a minute in the game.`\LIN FOUND HIS SHOT MORAL VICTORY`\What? pg knocked the ball away from him twice on the same possession and leonard threw in a wild, bad shot. spurs fans are really annoying today lol. `\oh Pop always so mean to Sager`\Same. You get the president you deserve`\I like the wayyyyyy you move`\Why not? By the far the most active spurs centric forum. Just ignore the player fan garbage trolling shtick and there's some really great info and takes from some of the long timers `\we have a shooting coach that works miracles.

It's like a match made in heaven.

Give us Ricky for two or three years, rack up a few championships and we'll give him back`\Oh absolutely. He costs us so many games late. I'm very surprised that went in. `\Did our new guy play this game? Kevin Martin, I think... how'd he do?`\bench gets shorter in the playoffs, not longer`\I heard rumors he could've gone to GS`\such humility, much spur`\Lol I know, i wasn't sure if you were being serious or not. Just f'n around man, I just like to give KD some flak over it. Durant is still one of my fav players in the league.`\I've seen this enough now that I never watch more than half a second, but I still enjoy it.`\David West is so fucking good, man.`\If you like defense, this game was really good. Both teams missed open shots but it was mainly lockdown D by both sides. `\Morris is a great defender, but Leonard is admittedly on another level. He probably just had a bad game. His offensive development has been incredible `\Only tears `\Fuck outta here slowban!`\Ibaka has turned back the clock!`\He hasnt been bought out, and probably wont be?`\Welp another slow start`\I mean I'll take calls but damn these refs are so soft`\Our only chance against the Warriors is if Danny Green and Tony don't suck. If they can just be passable we have a chance.

We have be relying WAY too much on LMA and Kawhi lately for offense lately. `\lol They're chanting "Go Spurs Go" and the pels don't have a chant to drown it out.`\PLAYOFFS LOCKED IN! Get your popcorn ready!!`\OKC really have fallen off. I wouldn't be surprised to see them drop to the 4 seed at this point.`\Looks so much like a game from last year`\Kawhi made a jumper in the paint and the announcer claimed offensive foul`\Fuck the Pelicans`\Do you live in the Dallas area? `\Aldridge must feel like he's in Portland again. Full takeover `\Oh my fuck Frazier has handles`\Wtf are these clowns doing out there for the Clippers?

Jesus get a fucking bench and gtfo GM Doc.`\He's back!`\That ending holy shit. Kawhi and LA are too deadly.`\I'm feeling a Danny Green game winner tonight.`\Tony fouled out?`\Didn't the lakers beat the Warriors like a week ago?`\Well, I just went through about a month of your comment history and couldn't find a single mean-spirited comment about an NBA player to throw back in your face. Closest thing was calling Patrick Beverley an asshole, but I'm pretty sure we take pride in that.

I think I just found the nicest person on Reddit. So, yeah. You win.`\I know half of the Spurs are sitting but I can't wait to see the rest of the team in the spotlight! Fully expecting a loss, but it's always cool to see the bench going up against one of the best teams in the league :)`\You have to love these grizzlies but fuck .`\Steam Roll`\You're a small person`\> he's such a huge spurs fan it's adorable. He knows all the players' names and everything lol. He's cheering on every play.

TIL I'm adorable`\Happened with the Miami ones as well. Boyan Marrovich`\Well they are missing another player thats pretty good.`\Lol wtf`\Westbrook has looked like the best player on the thunder for all 8 of their gamed I've watched this year lol`\Danny "The Redeemer" Green

`\how kawhi`\No thanks. Doing some calculus HW. I don't need any more distractions lol or I won't finish this. I have the Cavs Mem game in the background already`\Duncan is just cash money`\he looks like my attempts at creating a 2k player`\I'm enjoying it.`\Or the Suns `\That was the most blatant ill-advised gamble I've ever seen.`\Lol. I almost feel kind of bad.`\I think they put Boban into D league again for now`\None of us expected a win tonight. Are you retarded?`\Carmelo says no`\Whenever we need a clutch block in the 4th Duncan's ALWAYS got us`\11 rings in 25 years. What a dynasty.`\complaining about  dumbass 15 year olds when your name is swedishpenis
`\#BLOCKTOPUS `\and yet another foul on kawhi not getting called `\I don't have too many problems with it. It's better than the TWC app.`\I mean it displays what you get on an average night from him.`\I kinda want to see the Warrior make history reaching 73. Doesn't affect us either way. `\u know theres a reason he always doing good against u guys...`\Thunder are a fun team to watch but certainly not a contender`\I didn't see any of these threads.`\Oh this is the game thread?`\Man people give Quinn shit, I love him. Smotha'd chicken all day`\Spurs can't throw it in the ocean`\Buh-nuh nuh-nuh ^^nuh`\Just came over from the Celtics/Blazers and I get treated with JON FUCKING BARRY`\still got 66 wins though, that team had some great defense`\If there's enough offense, you can forgive unremarkable defense.  Nash wouldn't have two MVPs otherwise.`\Sorry, butt fuck the Clippers.

Ftfy`\This is painful`\what is it, then? There are two corners, top right and top left.`\Damn that one ref is jacked.`\I mean, if we had one of Conley, Zbo, or Gasol, this might be an even game.`\Something fun, I bet.  Mike looked disappointed.`\This bench sometimes works, but other times you just get garbage. Jamal, Austin, and Wes are all chuckers who are off a portion of the time (unless you're Wes, in which case you're off all the time). To me, the best lineup right now is Prigioni-Jamal-Wes-Green-Aldrich. When Blake is back either Green or Luc are going to be bumped to the bench and both can add to the bench. I'm not down on our bench, it's just bad when they have an off-night against the Spurs' bench.`\Spurs wouldn't do a player like that. We even played Jeff Ayres like 15-20 minutes his last game so that he would be talked about more in free agency.`\God dammit. Just one of those nights`\Chip Engelland is GOAT`\[Green's Put back jam](https://www.whipclip.com/embed/rxsc1)`\Wow, I tuned into this game waiting for the Bulls game to start and they had only 7  in the first so I was like lol fuck this. And they fucking win?

I seriously wish we had Lin on the bulls. He'd be such a huge upgrade for the bench, especially for 2 fuckin million `\LIN GOAT`\lol i thought that was paul pierce no. 34 for the D`\That's actually a pretty good argument to bench all the starters and experiment like crazy.`\*GINOBILI!*`\its obvious that they think AD isn't tht good which is fucking surprising, wtf is Gentry doing?`\I could see that happening, fast pgs give us fits. But he's shot isn't really falling. He would need to drive it like the couple time he did in the opening.`\You saw lance put his elbow into Simmons `\Given Green open threes might not be the best defensive strategy.`\We looked really good with Jonathan Simmons at the point`\I'm not an insider so I have no idea what the KD situation looks like, but in my opinion they need to trade Russell for as much as they can get and convince KD to stay. These two won't win a title together. They don't synergize well enough.

You could trade Russ for a top tier big man and a suitable pass first point guard. There's still time to build around KD and win a few titles. But having two superstars play heroball back and forth won't win titles in this current era. Pick one and compliment him`\Exactly. Spurs aren't ridiculous. Yes, they're good. But they don't win games like Steph does. He is just more marketable, and this season he's definitely been more successful. `\I thought the Spurs were going to have to cut someone to make room for him...who did they cut?`\First blood!`\Fatty Felton lol`\It's the Charlotte way. We ball out rightttt up until people consider taking us seriously and then fail epically. Flashbacks to Lebron's 61 point game against us. `\Danny Green sucks with o points, I want Bonner in. /s`\Oh my god the shooting`\How the fuck does that count? It went behind the backboard!`\I dont like Lamb handling the ball at all.`\Why isn't Aldridge? `\Amare "Whiteside" Stoudemire!`\CP3 crossed kawhi so hard lmfao`\> This is happening, a reality TV star is going to be president

`\Durant and Westbrook are gone`\you know its bad when you can see him hesitate on shots that he wouldn't have thought twice about last season`\Fuck the clippers and their elbowing-in-the-ballsness `\I need a replay of that Slo Mo steal + assist!`\Those Chinese guys Lee and Lin are pretty good`\OKC starters > Spurs Bench but OKC Bench < Spurs Bench's Bench`\Think we'll rest him on Friday?`\DavId West is the best signing from the offseason, `\Chicago defense looks so different. I wonder why?`\I'm attributing this to a combination of this team being inconsistent as fuck and them just matching up well with the Spurs the last two seasons.`\It was the second one when I commented, but both are awful.`\I just started watching at the end of the 3rd. The game was tied.

I think I'm a lucky charm for the Spurs. Or maybe I'm a lucky charm for the Thunder, and me watching this game is making the Clippers lose to give OKC a little more cushion on the 3 seed`\KAWHINDUBITABLY`\Sweet Jesus! Timmy was mugged by 3 pacers in the paint and still made it!`\Everybody wants to be the best, but Kawhi doesn't seem to want that to come at the expense of team success. When asked if he would rather score 50+ or hold his man to 0 points,  Kawhi said "Well do we win? "  `\That's right, bitch`\Yes plz`\RELEASE THE LASHARKUS.`\Dude, nothing is worth saying that.`\I get it. I thought the rockets would turn it around after getting Beasley. `\Cripple fight! `\The Spurs are undefeated at home....This can only mean one thing.`\This helps ease my Monday disappointment greatly.`\fuck Porker tbh`\Welcome to the Jungle, Miller! `\Switching the defensive priorities with Green on Durant and (more importantly) Kawhi on Westbrook made this game go our way. `\Still waiting on Rasual Butler to transition into Kobe `\danny always fouling 3 point shooters smh`\Frank is more than serviceable from 3.`\I swear to God if they call this a flagrant`\Spurs D is not very effective against Linsanity historically`\That's the only reason I think we didn't choose to sign him, we have enough inconsistent guards as it is`\Hornets confirmed best team in NBA`\linsanity fam`\How do other teams guard him?`\Oh man, Morris was taking that shot in the first half.`\He could be bricking for another ten years and you'll still be like 'his shot will come back, anytime now, this is just a bad patch'`\You get an and1, and YOU get an and1, and YOU get an and1.......shit everyone gets an and1 today!`\Lol what? They had all 3 of them and got whooped in the finals. Yeah that Heat team was good but the Spurs rolled along better than them, and then the Warriors are better than that. When exactly would those 3 guys have created and sustained a DYNASTY?`\or maybe just a really good backup point guard to lead the bench squad?`\That didn't look like a travel...`\COLD BLOODED.`\THAT WASN'T A FOUL LA GOT ALL BALL`\LMA is the best player in the NBA, fight me`\Are we back? `\Keep feedin' Kawhi and LMA!`\Great clutch block on Westbrook for sure `\A win is now no one getting hurt `\MONTA HAVE IT ALL

But really what a win, finally starting to come out on top in some close games. And against the Spurs nonetheless`\20/0/33 sweet`\Hoo boy...`\saying this during a timberwolves game...`\what Kevin should've said is "as beautiful a night for a walk on Bourbon St as any, and by that I mean that it's never a good night for a walk on Bourbon St."`\If only. That we could win.`\For real going that far off your dude.`\Lol two straight possesions Eric Gordon? just tumbles his way to the basket. Man give that shit to AD!!`\LETS GO`\Steven Adams you brilliantly grizzled bastard.

My gf says his stach is dashing.`\Ginobili is the *Joker*, and Kawhi is the *Thief*. `\Good lord `\GG errbody!!!! LINsanely entertaining!`\Kmart is like the skinniest guy ever`\LMAO KEN MAUER`\this cheer gives "clap" a worse rep than gonorrhoea`\Because he's a better player than Bonner.`\> especially

`\I believe I heard the F word there. `\Hopefully he's just saving all of his makes for the playoffs`\Definitely bad call `\It's been reported that he has been battling a cold for at least a couple of days too.`\That is not what average means. `\Austins shot? I must have missed that...`\Nifty, the replay center doesn't even know the score or how huge a call is. I think that's pretty interesting. `\more like 5`\spurs fans are pretty great, they show up a little late but overall i R8 8/8`\Spurs have taken 8 shots and Charlotte has only defended one of them.`\One can only hope.`\wow kyle anderson is a weird looking dude`\Jesus Parker`\Garbage fucking effort`\Too good to be true. Same with any free stream. I remember what's his face neubin? Or something a few years ago had pristine vlc streams. `\Feels like the whole team is clicking right now, I'm expecting pop to go all out Saturday vs golden state`\It is now.`\This foul on Diaw, smh, pathetic refereeing.`\Y'all seen this [Flappy Hornet](https://www.instagram.com/p/BDO9d21DBqs/) animation? Cute.`\And I say, you're not reacting enough!`\Nah Parker is pretty much an all you can eat free buffet for anyone if he doesn't get going early. He has been TERRIBLE on both ends of the court these past 10 or so games. Only reason he is starting is due to pecking order. Guarantee he will get pulled late game if it's close.`\Yeah, the site is messed up`\Huh, I wonder why [this comment](http://i.imgur.com/nclSlyu.png) would be downvoted.`\Yeah, you guys have 2 zombies on your team.`\Definitely Drummond `\I'm almost certain Pop once referred to him as one of those guys who could easily have fit in our system, but at the last second held back because of tampering rules. `\How the hell did Aldridge miss that? `\Shudder`\Im sad that Bulls are no longer the streak busters. Justin Holiday and Moore played decent tho.`\It'd be a shame if this Spurs team lost before facing the Warriors in the conference finals.`\Spurstalk?`\What an awesome game by Monta. Great defensive performance for the first 3 quarters by us too. Doing it without 3 rotation guys for most of the game makes it even better.`\Who does parker guard if the spurs match up with the Dubs lol`\yeah and back in 2014 we lost a lot of games to other top teams, went 0-8 vs OKC and Houston.`\David West is a beast`\I was just talking to a friend about this. A lot of people try to blame coaching, but why don't we blame these two superstar top 5 players who are now veterans and don't seem to show any leadership whatsoever? They are both having great seasons but this team has no heart right now, and when that is the case you have to look at the supposed leaders (and obviously coaching too - I do think that's also a problem). Durant and Westbrook can't be top 5 players if they continue to act like they don't give a shit what happens. I feel like this team has already given up on the season, and that is troubling because they have the talent to compete no matter how good SA and GS are. `\Seems like it now, comments are slowly trickling in.`\Yessir `\YOU THOUGHT YOU HAD US MOTHER FUCKERS`\Okay, time for Reggie to come in and do what he does in the 4th.`\Im really looking forward to him coming off the bench`\That heckler!!

>JJ you not that good!

>That's why y'all lost by 23 last night `\dat Nas instrumental `\Lol`\Because the spurs are known for their selfish, star-centered style of  basketball`\It is extremely saddening that this only happened 14 times in 75 games.`\Miller was always a solid player with us, I dont think he ever really played poorly`\Does Jrue at least play starter's minutes?`\are you kidding me?`\That's pretty disrespectful

Edit- That was KDs full quote `\ You basing this off one game? Lmao.
Since we last played you the bench has scored 52, 40, 45, 42, 55, 56

`\thank you 1 seed`\So this games basically over right? `\http://i.imgur.com/q7t2WvC.jpg`\Dang right we are. A lot of spurs fans are UT fans `\To the Clippers, actually.`\Well this is OKCs game to lose. Gonna see some weird lineups tonight `\MOOOOOOK`\He did. You aren't wrong. He was trying to sell the foul after`\Miller playing so far off Rubio because Rubio can't shoot haha `\Great, there goes the lead now that Parker is back.`\Lmao he got you guys the lead `\well...good game i guess?`\because there is more to basketball than the number of foul shots you take`\You zig, we zag.`\Also their honey mustard. `\Yeah I was pretty lucky to get to go. It's what's kept me going lol. `\Glad I have to go somewhere in 20min, otherwise I'd end up watching this entire thing in misery`\please tell me u werent watching the first quarter`\I see. Thanks for educating me, fams! :D`\To be fair it feels like everything takes you 2 hours to get to there. It's so spread out and full of traffic. `\I'm talking about Steph Curry shooting threes. He makes less than half of them.

The stats are there, on tons of different websites.`\Boban incoming!`\Ask Charles Barkley about the nightlife`\Kawhi and Danny kept on switching roles on Russ and KD and it worked really well. Would love to see more of that voodoo next week. `\We all know Pop is gonna bench him as soon as he hits 32.`\Linsanity!`\Holy fuck, you guys. This game is not Danny's fault. It was all around a bad game for most of our players. Too much isolation and we missed some shots we should have made.

Seriously, though. You all were raving about Danny two nights ago. But as soon as we lose you all want to blame him. Jesus. `\yes self, he is. `\Go kyle`\jeez, Towns is a beast.`\are clips gonna play defense tonight?`\LMA is seriously feasting on us from both ends. I wish ZBo was here. He always plays super well (offense and defense) against LMA. `\***WE DIDN'T GET BLOWN OUT!!!  SOMEHOW!!***  I enjoyed Friday's game more.`\LMA is straight cash homie right now`\I don't remember being offered a choice in the matter.`\IT'S REFUND SEASON`\Hey I was born in Metairie `\Half of our fan base came to the conclusion that the Warriors got exposed and aren't even that good based on literally one game lol.`\the people who say bench him should stfu now `\This is why Lin is the GOAT.`\BATUM YOU SAVAGE! STREAMABLE SOMEONE!`\I swear there's a voodoo curse on us at Smoothie King.`\Who pissed off Kawhi?

Edit: the Hornets I guess`\How did Ellis even act surprised there?`\It's embarrassingly bad. Is it effort? Or is he just that fucking incapable? Didn't Pop used to praise him for his "underrated defense"? I don't know what to think anymore. `\I'm not calling out the score I'm calling out the shit refs`\I do too man. I do too`\Why bench anyone when your team is 58-10? Whoever says that is an idiot.`\GREATEST.

Jim, the analyst, is especially keen. `\Thank god`\That's true, but when people say best two-way player I feel like you could look at it as the player with the best worse side between offense or defense, so Curry's defense is good but not great while Kawhi is pretty great on both ends.`\I'm not mad, or disappointed. Like you know that one meme "I expected nothing and I'm still let down."

`\If we win tonight's game we're locked into 2nd? `\http://i.imgur.com/layMlAN.jpg`\Manu always does something fucking badass whenever he plays the Kings. It was against the Kings when he took down that bat with his bare hands. `\As fun as the Warriors are to watch I like the finals to be "new" every year... and we'll you guys are just too damn good.

 I also really want Love to get a ring.`\Boban for MVP`\Great, now I need a change of underwear.`\DAMN DANIEL (green)`\LMAO OKC IS THE BIGGEST CHOKERS IN NBA HISTORY. Blow leads take dumbass shots and cant hang with the elites. Cant wait for KD to leave that place this offseason and join a REAL team`\Patty what the shit was that?!`\Way to make the call after he misses the layup. `\It's going down. TIMBER`\am I shadow and bed? can people see this comment? `\If Kyle Anderson played in the 60s he'd be as good as Oscar Robertson
`\Can't stump the drumpf `\I dunno, those three straight David West jumpers really shifted momentum.`\Went to watch the spurs kings game a while back. I know how you feel.`\Doris Burke Jalen and Jon Barry all working the game. Someone please fucking kill me.`\Does Parker even wanna play tonight? `\some unfortunate calls going against the pacers rn. `\MVParker taking a shit on you`\Can't beat this logic.`\I just wish Harden and Howard themselves believed this statement and take charge of the team `\That's alot of cap space between KL/LMA + KD`\If I hear one more fucking whistle`\lol thats some fucking bullshit.`\Neither did the Heat.`\Serge Ibaka is only 33 years old, but he has the hands of a 70 year old grandpa.`\If you're referring to us signing him in free agency then I'll admit that I was very happy when we signed him and I'm still very happy that he's on our team.  `\He also prefers the midrange (probs a little too much).`\Look, I like him. I just hate every time he checks in.`\You missed kawhi going beast`\this dude's a troll. `\Kawhi for mvp!!!`\He'd have to be Gary Payton for his defense to make up for his lack of offense.`\New goal for the Hornets, make it past 50 points.`\We could move Danny's contract this summer if we wanted to. Tony Parker is the only bad contract on the team.`\Parker and Aldridge are doing okay.`\The ball should be in kawhi or lamarcus' hands in every single play. And tighten up on defense for fucks sake, get parkers ass out of there `\I think that was the last. We were 3-2 in 2003 and we're 4-6 now in franchise history, so 2008 would have been the last win.

Yeah, pretty sure we lost in 2005 and in 2013, 2014, and this seaon. At least we made the Finals the last three times we lost?

Edit: So if I'm not mistaken, Tim Duncan's 1-5 in Christmas Day games. I find it SO typical that his one win was against the Suns.`\God damn this officiating is awful, for both sides.`\Can we please get back refmpart.`\>but don't act like the officiating isn't usually on your side.

I reject the notion that any team consistently gets treated better. Sure there will be runs or even entire games, but not over the course of an entire season.

It's not like he was awful. Mills just fit the need better this game.`\C'mon, no team is better at winning is the absolute minimal amount of effort than the Spurs.  However, Charlotte's got more at stake, and all of the momentum.`\Big Al looks like he's buddies with Muddy Waters`\Lauren is like the worst referee in the history of the nba. Almost as bad as Joey Crawford. `\Wooo!!! Internet buddy!`\Holy shit!

I looked away again, and now the game is almost over with the Spurs down.

This is Thunderesque `\The spurs have taken 20 more shots than the Pacers `\His family still loves him`\I think he's talking about the defense.`\GG, there are some crybabies in this thread though lmao`\Fortunately for me, my parents and older sister live in San Antonio and are big Spurs fans, and I currently live in OKC, so being a basketball fan is pretty entertaining.`\Buzz buzz `\Tuned into the game at the start of the 2nd because I wanted some background noise at work...became hooked and pleasantly surprised at the start of the 2nd half.`\I think Manu might be an Electric-type. Likes shocking plays and is super effective vs Flying.`\"JJ YOURE NOT THAT GOOD!" Anyone else hear this guy?`\Timberwolves. Duh.`\Yeah true doesn't matter too much at this point. It just really hurts to see this team with so much talent lose constantly because of terrible coaching.`\You probably have a shadow but I doubt you are a bed. I see this`\Bummer :(`\Good for you, fam`\Spurs couldn't buy a foul that quarter. Holy shit`\Yea he's starting to get his consistency back just in time too.`\Steph and his three point shot`\Hard to imagine us not going after a PG in that draft. Hill was traded and Many was full ball handler duty with the second unit.`\Westbrook + Durant playing awesome and a pirate and troll are going at it`\Enrique doing Enrique things`\Oh boy a non shooting foul and a play you couldn't even see a good angle on really got you in the hole there bud `\Sure, I'll ask Coach for you buddy`\Honestly?  Our offense bogs down a little but in reality it feels like every team gets fucking *hot* at the end of the game.  We should play better defense no doubt but guys just become unguardable while we miss shot after shot.

Some Examples:

Curry and Mo Speights

Kawhis step back and David west finding his range.

Rubio hits a 3 after Deing scores like 10 straight points mostly off free throws.

Remember the magic game earlier this year when Oladipo it like 3 step back 3s?

The clipper game every starting hitting everything

--

All of that could have been fixed by us scoring atleast 2, maybe 3 more baskets to close out the games.  OR by playing good defense and Westbrook not leaving shooters wide open.  It's just frustrating.
`\better!`\shhh!`\Luckily Boban is only half man too`\Manu!`\King Cake Baby is actually cool`\Lol them being on the floor has nothing to do with the ball actually going in the hoop man`\This offense is an eyesore`\And Danny Green`\thank you duck`\I think he's competing with reddick `\I know but specifically dudes who've never won a ring. Like Vince or Pau. Just try it for a year lol. `\Hoping the Spurs stay cold. We won't be able hold them off like every other team this season :/`\These TNT broadcasters are fucking terrible! REALLY! Why the fuck are these two arguing like babies on air?`\In 2014 there was nobody as good as GSW is now`\Haha my dad always forgets Portland's team name so I just call them "los de Portland" to which he always responds "Esos caaaabrones" since they used to play us hard like 2-3 seasons ago`\So the last game we couldn't hit and this game we can't miss. Can we retroactively apply some of our makes tonight to last night's game?`\Team AUS at the Olympics is gonna be good`\Yeah it's possible but those are literally the best teams in the NBA `\... that Steph is coming to Charlotte`\Ayy wuddup 361`\Reggie looks tired out there, almost like he's a step behind on defense. Never seen that from him before`\Really impressed with Richardson despite the loss.`\He's basically our only hope if we have any chance in this game.

Holiday's looking pretty solid too`\So fucking wet tonight LMA `\Thats what happens when you don't have to play with the offensive crutch that is a Parker lead offense.`\it was tough to watch tonight, wish he would drive more. missed some easy j's, once those start to drop more consistently we'll see more games like the 2 he had in los angeles`\is this thing on?`\GG Charlotte`\[James Harden](http://www.crabdribbles.com/wp-content/uploads/James-Harden-2.jpg)`\Just like Pop, they must wait to show what they really have until the post season.`\Jon Barry almost has less insight than Magic Johnson`\Nah man, it's just the system that makes him good. Didn't you read last years reddit posts?`\When Solo Hill hits a three you know something is in the air tonight`\GET KCP THE FUCK OUT
`\Kawhi with Simmons' body would be the second coming of MJ.`\I did first reply with "Curry corner 3s"`\That dunk was crazy but that three was meaaaaa!`\Kawhi's shot has looked ugly as hell the last couple of games.`\Logical conclusion`\I can't even be mad David West is not someone to be fucked with`\Goddammit David!`\But at the same time it's smart because their bench has to perform better for the Clips to have any chance at a deep playoff run. He's gotta force those guys to play and get better; can't rely on your starters to win every single game. `\Lol what a stupid thing to say. A) there's no way to prove that. B) Why does it fucking matter?`\Sean Elliott does!`\Prime Tim unleashed`\Rofl this just happened http://i.imgur.com/6OeA56r.jpg `\But why`\The Spurs defense still zoned in from the game against GSW lol.`\#FINALS PREVIEW?`\Lol at Patty poking Bobo in the eye`\Here's hoping we get a comeback at least. It was brutal losing that bad.`\Like do they do in the 4th quarter? `\Davis.... Blake. `\Fucking horse shit call.`\Yeah probably `\Fuck that last possession!`\http://i.imgur.com/j75vIc8.png`\Fuck the spurs`\God fucking damnit`\7 odds but I could be off by a few letters `\Stupid March Madness. Give me back Ernie, Chuck, and Kenny! `\Yup`\Yo the spurs play the dopest music`\Just making sure.`\Grizzlies busted their asses this game. It seemed like they were getting so many second chances. Glad to see McCallum have a decent game but I wish he made a few more shots. I liked him a lot before we waived him.`\We start games slow. When we get going it is enough to win most games, but that shit doesn't fly against the Warrios, they would blow us just like last time if we don't start at full force.`\Really great to see Manu get hot.  He's been a bit off since coming back from injury.`\Just need the NBA's leading clutchtime scorer to show up! `\5x5 would be great!`\I'm just here for the Sager/Pop interview`\Kawhi, carry us home.`\BECKY PINK BLOUSES`\Yeah it's sucked really really bad. Best season they ever had and I've only seen like 3 games. Though to be fair one of those games was live in Portland which was really fucking cool.  `\wow nice block!`\Yeah these are, but we had been plagued with shitty foul calls at home before the All Star break`\IT'S BOBAN TIME`\Somehow Rodney Stuckey is putting in the work for the Pacers.`\ITT: What the fuck.`\If it would have been the griz, I wouldn't even be mad. They fought like a mofo tonight. `\Perfect. `\Whats new.`\TP was WIDE open. Why didn't he take that three? Shooting 42%`\God I hope we can keep Lance. Love this dude.`\it happens with OKC too. They're just incredibly fortunate to have 2 athletic freaks and an MVP who can play 45+ minutes a game.

I'm watching on NBATV, but I really want to hear this`\I've been here since I was 13 haha`\You said that when someone shoots a 3, they'll prob miss. I said that Curry Corner 3s (will probably go in). Specifically, corner 3's from the right. He's made 51.4% of them in the 2015-2016 season. It's live stats. People obviously agree with me and disagree with you, and you're digging yourself a deeper hole by saying that what I said is irrelevant. `\Rivers...(cue dramatic thunder clap)`\This is like a hyperbolic time chamber to improve the Kawhi - Lamarcus connection. At least it feels like Mills is also helping but everyone else is sort of spazzing the fuck out.`\WON'T SOMEBODY THINK OF THE CHILDREN`\Also it half of our roster didn't have season ending injuriues`\The rim has a fucking magnet on it for Kawhi. `\Danny Green is leading in scoring right now y'all.

It doesn't even matter that it's just Russ in that clip, everyone on the fucking team does it every fucking possession. It's ridiculous how many open 3s we let people have.  `\Pop mad. But, looks like off of Parker. `\I saw that hornets scored 7 points in the first quarter and were down by like 20 something... How? `\Tony runs the offense:

Tony and LMA/Tim run 2 pick and rolls, leads to shitty 0/X Tony jumper or heavily contested shot by the big.

Kawhi runs the offense:

Kawhi does whatever the hell he wants, ie: drive, post up, pick n roll,  we score.

I wonder which ones been more effective tonight.... `\Danny Green 4/5 from 3 point range ??? What is going on ???`\Genuinely love this Hornets team this year.

Be *something* positive.`\Westbrook so happy leonard not out there lol`\Was tony allen laughing?`\I've always liked the Grizz since the Hubie Brown, Pau Gasol days and feel so bad about what happened to y'all this year with the injuries, especially since y'all are so challenging in the playoffs always `\I was joking, I was referring to the heckler that came in clear through the tv and gave us the gem "JJ you're not that good!" I was actually impressed by him, he had some good moments and looks like he improved a lot.`\Holy shit man`\Correct. That was a crucial shot. It was like Marco Belinelli's one good shot in, I think, the last game of the Finals in 2014 that ended a strong Heat run where they were closing in on us. Sometimes all a player has to do is make one important shot that subtly changes the direction of the game.`\GG Spurs

We need to win games like this to even sniff a championship.

Where did he go?`\It's the coaching man, Russ had a bad game for sure, but he needs a fucking coach to help him out so he doesn't get frustrated enough to play like that.

You clearly see Kawhi hit George on the arm. Even the Spurs announcer admitted it.`\Too much butter on that croissant.`\I think we'll look back at them like "damn they missed a chance at a dynasty". Kinda like how the early 2000s Magic almost had Tmac/Grant Hill/Tim Duncan. `\It's like they only realized AD could get points in the 4Q, when Jrue kept feeding him.`\Spurs have cooled down :/


not getting boards`\Green was great in the GS game defensively.  Just going through a slump I guess`\Games without Kawhi scare me`\GR33N!`\Baynes played damn well, kept the Pistons within 2 even without Drummond, somebody needs to stop Kawhi though`\man even Harlan and Reggie just want this game to be over so they can watch the next game`\I like those odds`\Hey man, why you gotta be like that`\can someone explain to me how Spurs are up...I don't have a way to watch the game`\OMG GORDON PLS STOP`\Yeah its upsetting but that's how basketball be sometimes heh`\He's been on the Grizz for 2 years now... `\Please, no. `\Bruh I checked this like ten minutes ago and it was tie game `\Apparently the spurs have a weakness.

And its Jeremys`\No, not at all, but when your team is shooting 34% and 16% from 3 it's hard to win that game.`\What you wanna bet we can blow this 30 point lead here. Back I'm '82 they could blow a 40 point lead. No doubt in my mind `\I'm sick of the number of short mid-range jumpers we've had. Jesus please. `\The Pelicans have had our number the last 2 years. We just match up poorly with them.`\It seems like you guys always beat us`\it's a very underrated signing`\KD and WB have played 32 & 34 minutes against our 1st and 2nd bench units. I'll take it.`\No, we weren't toying with them
We just got hot at the end`\Ass fouls are as valid as any other foul`\Give ball to Kawhi pls `\You asked for it lol`\Haven't done the exact calculation yet but I'm pretty sure after this game he'll have a career high in FG%, pretty impressive considering his slow start. `\When are they gonna replace Pop with a cardboard cutout for these halftime interviews? `\his turnovers are so high because of how much he handles the ball, it's not nearly as bad when you look at TOV% and other advanced stats. not to mention those three went to the finals together, so that squad has def already worked out. `\Happy Easter :D Well it is here anyway`\Jesus missing gimmes`\Calling fouls based on player reactions smh`\why can we not play well against the Pelicans? like seriously wtf`\Without a doubt `\Pretty sure those were like the direct links to the NBA League Pass streams so... yes.`\I would imagine as reliable satellite tv. Probably goes out with clouds/rain.`\Im officially on the Singler is shit trade... especially after how I seen this bench play with Morrow and not Kyle `\Kawhi channeling his inner manu`\They kick ass and I'm happy I can watch every game listening to them. Also bill land goes to my local bar so that's cool.`\It's like parents telling you you're going to do something whether you like or not. `\Yes. Bacon cheeseburger with large fries and drink. `\The turnovers are gonna drive me insane`\Haha it's hard not to. Dude's fucking incredible.`\Why does Lance pretend to be unselfish?  It rarely works.`\injuries `\they say you can shoot out of a slump. Well he shoots a lot, still in his slump`\It's actually getting ridiculous, they're so blatant too.`\Don't the Spurs have 61 bench points?`\He's actually been fairly solid when he gets minutes. Just as good if not better than we could've hoped for`\That is actually the right call`\Lamarcus 32/12/1 on 12/16 shooting

I'll be in my bunk`\Dagger`\The seed!`\I'm loving the game going on between Andre Miller and the rookie. Rookie wants to show play up on him and Miller just playin that old man game`\D-league his ass.`\I've had to start taking Prilosec`\please`\TP to LA was a thing of beauty to watch tonight, especially in the 3rd quarter.`\Lolclips `\The blueprint: have a Lee and Lin`\Dude stop you're embarrassing warriors fans `\Leonard is having the quietest 15 point performance I've ever seen.`\He's got a 105 defensive rating, it's not amazing but it's slightly above average`\GG Spurs. AT least we have the Nets Lakers and Magic next`\Did you know Josh Smith and Dwight Howard played AAU together?`\35-1`\the dabbing needs to end`\I dont really get why Patty isnt playing over him right now.`\Keep grinding that leadership. I hear once you get past +75 leadership you get a playoff spot.`\"YESSIR" lol i fucking love how West always calls out mismatches`\But today is Tuesday, so shouldn't those 7 odds be divided by 2?`\Something tells me Doris Burke is a bit of a Spurs fan, but I just can't put my finger on it...`\*all lol`\>a 39 year old man with only one knee`\Bruno is a national treasure.

I follow DPG21920 on twitter tho, least I can have a decent convo with him without all the shit on ST lol`\really good.`\Rubio is sort of like a younger Andre Miller.`\ok this is where the blowout starts`\Boban is who the Spurs replaced Baynes with.`\This gave me a sensible chuckle.`\Kawhi gets a oop  just about every game. Great play to run outta time out. Com on Reggie.`\Hornets are pretty underrated IMO.`\Linsanityyyyyy!`\shoot the DANG BALL kyle!`\I need to find someone that looks at me the way ESPN looks at Jon Barry.`\Oh my that was beautiful`\God we are so close to pulling away COME ON GOYS`\Having a 7 foot wingspan helps`\tyus can fuckin shoot`\Tim Duncan is the big brother of everyone in the NBA.`\I mean I wouldn't mind if it went* our way this time. lol.

*Edited out "Wen't" dah fuck?`\Kaw*HI EVERYBODY!*`\I love how Andre miller is instantly assimilated into the Spurs offensive machine `\KD P/ Russ`\Kawhi "I got ice in my veins" Leonard! `\Will we not rest some players?`\It was ugly, but we've done worse this season.`\between him and mo`\He just said bleep this team on the Internet. That's enough to roast this dude for lol`\The camo jerseys are so wack`\looking like his stated age lol`\Annoying as hell`\We really are not gonna get very far if Tony Parker plays like this for the rest of the season. `\Hornets confirmed best in the league`\They probably mix him up with that Bojan Bogdanovic guy`\Manu ginobree`\We are so bad. I'm sick of us not even trying to play defense. `\I'm so glad Kawhi and LaMarcus are our future`\I've seen this comment 100 times this season. We get it, it's played out now`\I'll take the under`\Damn Ibaka looks fresh. Hopefully he's kicking it up in preparation for the playoffs`\Jabaka drains it.`\Raising your arms is not a technical`\And Green the worst fastbreak finisher and Kyle Anderson the slowest fastbreaker in the NBA.`\We have one of those guys too, haha`\We already have 13 players active this game`\Damn I think all of Minnesota wanted Boban to hit that dunk`\The Sandwich hunter strikes Westbrook.`\TOO MANY TURNOVERS!`\yea heat are playing well, sticking with the spurs so far`\Perkins nooooooo`\Generally to compete in basketball, you have to play all 4 quarters. Next time we should try playing in the 3rd one.`\I think it was "hopefully they got that chicken bone out of their throat from Saturday"`\So many upsets in so little time. What a time to be alive.`\ROXBURY CAM YOU DISAPPOINT!`\How does Demps still have a job?`\Are we really gonna let this nonsense get traction? Dude has been playing shitty not much else to say. To try and get behind this silly age theory for a player having a bad season is just dumb and shows how knee jerky this sub can be `\Let me be honest with you and I know I'll get a lot of hate for this. I don't think the Cavs can win with Kevin Love.`\their offense didn't make the road trip with them i guess`\Lady lookin' like a pidgeon`\lol that dribble by Leonard.`\Linsanity`\FOULFOULFOULFOULFOULFOULFOULFOULFOULFOULFOULFOULFOULFOULFOULFOULFOULFOULFOULFOULFOULFOULFOULFOULFOULFOULFOULFOULFOULFOULFOULFOULFOULFOULFOULFOULFOULFOULFOULFOULFOULFOULFOULFOULFOULFOULFOULFOULFOULFOULFOULFOULFOULFOULFOULFOULFOULFOULFOULFOULFOULFOULFOULFOULFOULFOULFOULFOULFOULFOULFOULFOULFOULFOULFOULFOULFOULFOULFOULFOULFOULFOULFOULFOULFOULFOULFOULFOULFOULFOULFOULFOULFOULFOULFOULFOULFOULFOULFOULFOULFOULFOULFOULFOULFOULFOULFOULFOUL`\Parker 18pts with 16 juicy assists...that's my boy`\This is coming from a team that lost to the Lakers.

Sorry I forgot the sky is falling thanks for reminding me. All that matters is how we play in the playoffs. Ever since we lost Mo Cheeks to his surgery have not been the same.`\Maybe he really is just way older than his listed age. Someone made a post about African players lying about their age, and the more I watch Serge play, the more I'm inclined to agree with that guy. `\Hoping KAT goes off. `\He comes in Pacers lead balloons to 16 point. His ass goes to the locker room, lead cut to 6.`\you should. the spurs have more to lose in the long run than the pelicans who would need a miracle to make the playoffs.`\Easy to get that many offensive rebounds when you miss so many of your shots.`\Monta really have it all <3    `\brb gonna check the mavs game. woooo southwest`\Kyle Anderson's shot looks alot like David West's, slow not a big lift and slightly fading away. He's been having pretty good accuracy from the midrange too. `\I hate them equally`\Ugh I was right `\we always hate christmas games tho`\Has Austin Rivers ever made a layup?`\let's be honest, RIP Cavs`\Strange- i've never heard of it. Define "extremely popular"? I've read plenty of classics but this one i don't think i have ever come across.`\Fun fact: drive through alcohols in south Texas t oo`\Not sorry, fuck the Clippers.

Edit: Wuck Fes too`\We exhaust our old guys and won't make the Finals. `\Lmaooo (slowly and painfully on the inside)`\Kill em Pooh`\Yes.  Because we're classy, motherfucker.`\Honest question. Why are Grizz fans mad about the play that got Lance hurt? I only saw one replay, but it looked like he used his off-arm to clear Simmons out, which is an Offensive foul, not a defensive foul. Did I see something wrong?`\How's that for a "system player" Durant?`\We have lost the last 3. `\The whole I'm a raunchy girl act gets old fast`\Can we put this myth away that San Antonio can't beat the top teams?

They're 1-1 vs Cleveland, OKC, and the Clippers. They have lost once to Golden State but have 3 more games. They're fine. `\-also KD 2 seasons ago


`\Who says old bird can't learn new tricks? Smooth as a feather`\I feel your pain on that Davis `\You're not getting it no matter how this game goes `\YOUNGTRECE`\Hope Lance is alright, last thing Memphis needs is more injuries.`\With that left hand`\You have to train the hair to grow in the direction you want. That includes blow drying it the right direction after a shower, using products, etc.

I use Johnny B pomade, found at most grocery stores I think. But it all depends on what you want to do with your hair.

Have to be careful with pomades, if you get a wax based pomade it will not wash out when you want it to without some serious work. Water based pomades will wash out effortlessly but offer less ability to style or restyle mid day.`\The problem against GSW the first time around was that the Spurs had so many good shot opportunities in the first quarter but nothing was going in and everything was going in for the Warriors. Then the Spurs were just tilting so bad. `\after 7 points... how did they...you know what I'm not even gonna ask.  Thank you Charlotte. `\Then we get to see a gfy of it on the front page. `\We've created a monster.`\It's not going to be pretty, but let's go Grizz! ^Fuck ^^The ^^^Clippers`\Thanks fam!`\Duncan so happy he finally gets to play against a legit big guy in Whiteside. lately he has been benched too much cause every other team goes small ball these days`\Danny Green is back!`\Any chance Conley comes back in time for playoffs?`\Because they're the Spurs.`\Ayy D. Rob!`\stretch layup`\cavs, spurs, gsw, raptors and okc all shat the bed within a week`\I'm stuck in class I just looked at the box score we only scored 7 fucking points in a quarter Jesus christ`\Miller and Livingston gotta be the best PGs at the post.`\so um andre miller was a great pickup. `\Danny Green is fucked.`\thats the coach`\I will never understand why teams leave LMA open at the FT line lol...`\Poor Shaq didn't get invited to do the NCAA tournament`\Reminds me of Peyton Manning with his forehead.`\1 actually.

Dude just gets doubled and denied that ball`\Lin > Curry tonight. Like it's not even fair to bring up Curry, Lin was straight fucking fire tonight. `\Aight lets not play like we already won this...`\touched by god`\The latter. 19 straight years of playoff appearances, winning records above .600, winning road records, having the best PF to step onto the court (who is still playing at a high level no less), and one of the best HC ever makes everyone take them for granted and just accept the Spurs will be contenders. `\And why did we not cut bonner? Still amazed he missed both axes they took to the roster.`\Come ON`\There's a pretty vocal number of supporters on the spurs subreddit that get off to how "high of a basketball iq this kid has" and mark him the second coming of Manu, but ignore that he passes up more wide open shots than he makes. `\Gorgui is an awful defender.`\David West fighting out there. `\Yeah this joke is probably never used in Spurs threads`\I'M EXCITED`\[Lock it up.](http://cdn.makeagif.com/media/9-05-2015/uIS3tp.gif)`\Lin's gonna get some slapass tonight`\As great as Kawhi has become defensively, he'll still have clunker offensive games. Batum also played really good defense. Good reminder that he's still only 24 years old and still has a lot of growing to do on that end. `\I'm going to my first home game on Tuesday. I'm so fucking hyped`\But the commentator said he can't defend`\That dude in the Spurs glasses is definitely rolling hahaha`\So shall it be. `\looks like this is gonna be a good game`\You'd think Danny Green would quit shooting 3's when the first 10 in the 4th didn't go in. `\I'm glad he didn't. He played hard at OKC and deserved a rest. And Boban got some valuable minutes.`\He was god awful.

`\Thank you. There is no reason to hope that he will. He was garbage last year and he sucks this year. `\We're competing in spurts. That's literally all I can ask for from these guys.`\All these flavors and you choose to be salty.`\its not just spurs threads. its all game threads. `\Shit, that was worse that I thought.

`\That would be a neat team tho`\Get Ibaka out and put Kanter in, we need those fucking boards badly`\Haha true! I like his work so far. He seems like a solid DJ who knows he's playing to a mostly family-oriented crowd.`\In r/thunder we don't like Donovan too much. He has 2 top tier assistants in Mo Cheeks and Monty Williams and without them since the AS break, he's getting exposed. He doesn't know how Timeouts work, he clearly doesn't know how to close up games, idk, he may be a good coach, but not a good coach for this team. `\Since the all star break our closing of games has been really bad. The offensive schemes seize right up, the line ups become more confusing for us fans, and the turnovers become really frequent. I would still back KD to be clutch in a last 30 seconds scenario (excluding the warriors game) but it's the 8 minutes before thay which don't even allow an attempt.`\I didnt say it was time yet. Hoping he turns it up in the playoffs`\lmao refs`\It's tough to gaurd a team that excels at mid range post up fadeaway jumpers like cmon `\Shit, we ended on a 20-5 run`\What's the other team with 15 wins by 25+?`\tonight wasn't his normal night though. his shot selection was very normal from what he's been doing all year, but the volume was something else. he also seemed more aggressive in getting some looks. if this is what he's like in the playoffs, not many teams will stand a chance`\Quite obvious, don't know how they missed it.`\Should've signed Lin

Oops`\Omg`\Butler got subbed in for like the last minute of the fourth Q but I don't think he did anything`\Another team that got broken by the warriors. `\LeBron is over. All the casuals and media have moved to Oakland.`\Yeah this lineup for the Clips is fucking awful`\danny bby`\I LOVE PERKINS, LET HIM PLAY`\Wish he woulda made the last three`\This is one of those nights.`\Ugh I'm so fucking sick of being sick and it's only been a day. Kill me pls `\NOOB SAIBOT IS KILLING US`\The man is 4/5, lol. You had a pretty funny call on that so far. `\God damn Timmy!`\He got a shooting foul AND someone slapped his arm! That should have been two. What the fuck.`\He was absolute fire for the GSW game so I guess it makes sense that he goes on a cold streak haha. `\Shit I'm laughing here alone. Can I use this for The Beard's game some time?`\Pop is being merciful to this incredbly depleted Memphis team

it's just a tough year for the Grizzlies
`\Yes... listen to this guy.`\This post game thread or the other one?`\Oh man K-Mart is starting?`\Westbrook playing with common sense. How has he been in the 4th for you guys?`\Nice 20 point lead bro.`\fuck it throw bonner in there `\Spurs so good in the fourth quarter the past few weeks, even against Indiana.`\*Threeee^e^e^e`\They dont need rest like them Spurs starters. They're young`\Shit was over when they gave Ellis those 2 free throws because he flailed like a little bitch. Glad this abortion is over `\did anyone notice after the manufacturer charge at the end, it cut to pop telling the ref he was "absolutely terrible tonight" or something like that.`\Me too man, me too`\I wish`\It's funny to me that you actually think you're good at being an asshole.  `\Hey guys I'm trying to do a shit the announcers say so if there's anything noteworthy from this game, reply to this post, pm me or just make it it's own comment and I'll try to find it.

That shaky cam fucks me up`\CLUTCH `\4 point game without blake lol`\These refs got money on the game.`\thx mr buzzybees`\So what this game has told me so far is the Spurs would be the Lakers without Pop`\Probably doesn't.

But we need mills on the bench. `\What a tool`\This is Parker. he always gets sold short. Spurs fans seem to not be his biggest fan still. `\holy fucking shit get in there basketball`\LOL`\Right, but there was 9 minutes left and we were down 10.  `\Can't blame you.

Edit: And now he throws a lazy pass to Mills smh`\Way to give me a heart attack. Hornets deserve this one. We let that go pretty damn badly.

Gordon and Jrue went hero mode and froze out AD, Gentry kept Perkins in over Ryan.`\D league I think`\Covering March Madness`\Batum is good. I was just talking about certain moments within the previous game.

Lin isn't taking Kemba's job, therefore he still needs to find his team.`\Mills starting would expose a pretty huge flaw in his game.

Spurs don't even play Miller unless it's garbage time, why not develop Ray more? I guess they are expecting Miller to play some minutes in the playoffs and want someone more proven. Problem is, they could use a younger pg who can defend Westbrook and Curry. CoJo did a great job defending Curry last season. He defended him from full court and really bothered him when Parker or Mills were resting. They don't have that luxury anymore with a young 3rd string pg. Oh well.`\https://streamable.com/1rcy`\That should be a continuation goaltend. Patty gets fouled, doesn't put the ball back on the floor and shoots it.

Lmao`\He hasn't really lost his 3pt shot. 2015, sure, 2016 no. For the season, he's up to 35%.

In January he shot 49.1% and in Feb he's shot 36.7% for 2016. That's pretty good. That's like 42-43% from beyond the arc in 2016. For comparison, Patty mills is about 44% from beyond the arc in 2016. `\Wow our bench is at like -15 and our starters are like +15. Cool`\I cringe every time Danny Green takes a three`\I wonder what the moneyline on the hornets was after the first quarter. `\And don't you forget it!`\Kawhi and LMA carried us on offense at the end, but god damn Old Man Riverwalk was absolutely stellar on D to close out the game`\BULLSHIT`\His first game back after getting benched.

`\I loved the quote from the commentators on the Spurs side when West went nuts and got like 3 boards in one possession and scored.

Not really

Agree with everything else tho
`\So stoked about how well Kawhi/LMA are doing lately.`\After watching his post-game interview Kawhi is either THE most boring NBA player or a robot`\Yeah, I miss RoLo :(.

think about it.`\I just wish we had one primary scorer. Just one. The spurs have aldridge, we have no one. Just someone to run plays for instead of just random passing hoping for an open shot. This sucks.`\Dray has been no good since the ASB.`\Fucking Westbrook :( `\Haha yeah, he comes to a lot of the games! `\We don't have to talk about it, if it still hurts too much.`\Kawhi stole it`\This is some classic Pels shenanigans to end this game`\Or on a dead ball...
`\The salt is real`\They've won their last two home games by single-digits. Slackers!`\Go Hornets!`\Boy, this officiating on both sides`\Fuck Mills is playing amazing.`\There's the owner. Blame him. `\single digits again?

prepare your anus!`\BOBAN!!!!`\What?

Astute observation`\I haven't really been paying attention to the crowd are we really cheering for the spurs or are there just so many spurs fans`\It helps that we never had flashy superstars. Pop always went with the quiet guys who simply let their game do the talking. `\its a joke and supposed to be taken as nothing more than that`\I do live betting on Bovada and the Hornets opened up to a 2-0 lead which gave the Spurs a little less chance of winning haha.

`\Was it just me or was Jrue Holliday blowing by almost everyone and then blowing half his layups at the end of the game?`\Welp`\Whiteside getting embarrassed by our third string C and people saying he should be DPOY lol. `\The reason the Clippers can beat the Spurs is because their best scorers aren't wings which limits what Leonard can do against them without forcing cross matches on the other side. `\He always does them is the good bit! Those midrangers are money`\Think we let this one get away from us :/ `\doesn't matter if they're blameless. Fact is they are the best players on the team and if they left then OKC will be significantly worse. `\Russ probably going to eat tonight `\Damn Kyle, you're defense is amazing`\I disagree coz' I think Dame is really talented. But I think the Blazers as a team is overrated.`\multiple times i've seen that this season, including when AD had 59 points, and Jrue didn't pass to him to get 60 multiple times in a WIN when the opposition had given up so game wasn't in balance.`\Thank you.`\DAT DANNY FLOATER LOL`\Why was Kawhi not in?`\GREEN`\Spurs beat Warriors, Hornets beat Spurs. Hornets #1`\Kawhi Leonard is ridiculous, man. `\It's insane. Only thing keeping him up is his defense (which is really good) because his offense has been terrible this season.

Edit: he averaged 11.7 ppg last season and he's averaging 7.3 ppg now. 3p percentage went down from 41.8% on 5.6 attempts to 33.2 on 4.4 attempts.`\Yea, must be tough being a Spurs fan.  When's the last time they won anything?!`\Perhaps I don't fully understand the +/- stat (hint: I don't), but can someone explain how Danny Green can have a +23 when he's only scored 4 points?`\do i say, "Damn Pels", or "WTF Spurs"?`\so what you're saying is you weigh offense and defense. so what is the difference between best and best two way?`\��`\How come people's posts aren't showing?

Bad for us..:(`\How tf is that a foul? Should've never even had the opportunity either since Patty should be on the line.`\Nah it was down for like a 1/2 hour`\*sigh*.

GSG`\Holy fuck, you guys. This game is not Danny's fault. It was all around a bad game for most of our players. Too much isolation and we missed some shots we should have made.

Seriously, though. You all were raving about Danny two nights ago. But as soon as we lose you all want to blame him. Jesus. `\I swear this Wolves team is like a college all star team from the past 3 years.`\Why was Miller not even close to this good on the Wolves`\Holy shit.

Only 4 comments, but it says 16. `\They gonna review every layup contest now?`\ > contenders

 > Pacers`\Between the over dribbling, taking ages to set up the offense, horrendous drives into the paint, terrible passes once he gets trapped, his tendency of ignoring Leonard, and his occasional bad defense, I can't see him ever coming back to "form".`\too expensive. Marvin Williams is better in the role we're giving him`\Can pop not fucking bench this fucking joke of a point guard? Cannot run a fucking offense for jack shit when he wants to get himself into the game by make stupid decisions. I mean Leonard is keeping you in the game for fucks sake.`\That would be a long game.

For the most part`\That series pulled me out of depression.`\Anyone who follows the NBA  beyond casually knows how good Redick is. I mean, arguably the greatest coach ever decides to put the reigning DPOY on Redick, despite him having 2 MVP caliber players as teammates, showing just how valuable Redick is and how him getting going is what really kickstarts that Clips offense to the next level. He's clearly behind Harden/DeRozan/Butler, but any other guy, he's fair game to be argued against. Gives great effort on defense and tires out whoever is defending him by running around countless screens. Not only is he great at catch and shoot, but also taking one dribble and pulling up off a curl.  So yea, casual fans probably arent as aware of him but anyone who closely follows the game and the league knows this dude is legit`\Maybe we should give them the bucket anyway`\Reply with dank memes if you can see my comment. `\BECKY VS LAUREN MID COURT LETS GO`\I think he doesn't get enough credit sometimes because everything he does looks smooth and effortless.

My #1 want from this coming off-season is to get a solid defensive center (assuming Timmy retires with some new hardware (:) with enough cap to chase a Westbrook the following off season to replace Tony.

Westbrook whole game is based on his freakish athleticism, much less on skill. Shooting is a skill that's not going away with age.

There's also the question on how much other teams will pay him. I would think he stays unless some other team offers something crazy (which wouldn't be surprising given the amount of cap space this offseason). I don't really want to speculate because I am terrible at valuing players, especially with the new cap, but I would think a multi-year contract at like 5-10 per year would be beyond what the Spurs would pay and would be enticing enough for Boban to take the money. `\Lin with 27 points???

Now when he gets on, then he's on and very dangerous... the problem is you just don't know what you're going to get out of him at any given time, and his mediocre-to-bad version of himself is a lot more common than the good-to-Linsane version of himself.

Nothing more frustrating than to see us have all the momentum only to check Lin in and him single-handedly kill it all with boneheaded out-of-control drives to the basket where he just jacks something up hoping for a call (that he rarely gets) or seeing him make careless and easily preventable turnovers.

Spencer Hawes and PP's corpse should NOT be anyone's priority.`\Funny, your fourth quarter comment was the text I sent to my coworkers.`\It's a modest place to live, I mean you obviously have your wealthy and not-so-wealthy areas of the city but further out of 410 and before 1604 is what I would call the middle class. South side is primarily Hispanic culture and the west and north sides are mixed pretty well. The closer you get to the city and to the east, you notice military grunts. Overall the city is great for living in and raising a family, especially for military personnel.`\Don't have cable and Applebee's is close and cheap. Gotta a lot of looks cheering for D West's buckets in the fourth. `\HoC is so good you'll want to watch it all in one sitting. Watch JJ before DD S2.`\He shoots 51.4% from the right corner. That's over 50%.

We can go at this all day troll.

I don't disagree with you that he'll probably miss from the opponent's freethrow line, but we're talking about corner 3s and you can't read or won't read "51.4%".

So keep wasting everyone's time.`\What a comeback!`\Shhh don't tell your downvote brigade`\Before the last timeout I heard him yelling "JJ YOURE NOT THAT GOOD!"`\Anyone think Becky Hammond looks a bit like Janeane Garofolo?`\Not if.

When. `\Both of you have failed the Spurs nation. OUT OF MY SIGHT. BOTH OF YOU`\My god after TD and TP bumped seeing pop laugh made me smile so much. `\Finally we get a fucking bucket..`\Yeah, me too. This was on Bovada. They tend to be pretty close to Vegas, though.`\Nobody shoots above 50% from three.

This is real fucking simple guy. Nobody is shooting over 50% from three. There is not a player who shoots their average three point shot that you could say anything but "it's probably going to miss" because it's probably going to miss.

More importantly not even Curry corner 3's, like you stated, are over 50%. This year, anyway.`\Credit to the Hornets, they're playing super well.  `\He would be my pick in front of Draymond atm`\Poor Austin lol`\Someone check on Shaq. I think that Austin Rivers dunk may have raised his blood pressure.`\that was some Happy Gilmore shit there`\The rebounding on that play....

`\san antonio got some calls their way imo but overall they are still outplaying bulls badly

e: holy fuck spurs fans, i just made an observation and got like 5 downvotes in 30 seconds..in a slow thread.`\Diaw got fatter. The donut shops in Charlotte missed him they want Sean May back too.`\I hope Boban demolishes Whiteside until the end of time he needs to grow the fuck up and stop being a baby and a dirty player`\Every fucking time.`\I miss Ray, not really feeling Andre Miller. `\jesus christ lin slow down`\Thank you!....but that's what I'm using.  It keeps jumping back.  Very disorienting.  My laptop is garbage.  Clearly.`\uh oh the spurs are getting back to single digits, better make up some bullshit calls`\They weren't dropping against the Kings the other night, too.`\Boban is the zombo.com of people`\Sugar K Leonard!`\Every single Spurs thread is full of people saying the refs are favoring the Spurs. So either SA has legit paid the refs or the players play D without fouling like is coach Pop's philosophy. Spurs have some of the lowest fouls per game in the league. They just don't foul much.`\Happy to see JHolla playing well`\No it has to be a streamable that loads slower than it plays so it stops halfway through and you have to start it over again`\We're signing Kevin Martin and somebody needs to be cut to clear room. Most think it'll be Bonner.`\Durant to Charlotte confirmed.`\They'll have to start a fire in the locker room at half if they want to have a chance.`\70%`\There was like .4 left. The buzzer has to go off while the shots still in the air to be a buzzer beater.`\Just laying there on the floor.`\He definitely was on the court at times, but someone could argue against it and I would not put much of an argument...

I don't know what's up with TP but this play is not going to cut it as we close the season`\'Tis true.`\Slomo is going to be a monstrous rebounder in a year or two. The guy has great jump timing.`\Spurs 3 point shooting woes are gonna be what kills us in the playoffs`\I'm ok with that!!!`\Damn Kyle's killing it on garbage time`\I'm pretty satisfied with how that went.`\Two totally different games, and I'd for sure disagree with this. Martin has averaged 10 pts at least a game since his rookie year iirc. We brought Martin in as an offensive spark plug and three point shooting, Butler was more of a big body stand in the corner and play solid 3 and D guy. `\we aren't even the garbage man's warriors, they wouldn't score fking 7 in the first quarter`\It's there, but they delete old posts and post threads right before start time`\Wow that's pathetic. `\Ya ever heard of these guys? They both named jeremy hehehe`\There are a lot of lonely and bored Spurs fans here...`\Both Cavs and Spurs trying to give the Warriors a run for their shit-playing money tonight.`\Good grief. `\While I have to say I'm annoyed that Danny builds brick houses these days his incredible defense is a big part of why the Spurs win so much. If he has his shot back they would probably have the same record as the Warriors. `\> I reject the notion that any team consistently gets treated better.

Clearly you are not old enough to remember watching MJ and the Bulls then. `\Is it bothering you that much?`\.211, .274, .389, .470, .549, .557, .644, .813

%ast'd.... which one do you think Klay is? You get one guess.

Spot up shooter, average defender at best, average finisher... sounds like a system player. A good one, sure. He isn't the kind of player you game plan for. The other guys are.

Do I really need to explain how LMA is a two way player? Kawhi is the best player on the Spurs, but the offense is based off of the low post threat first.

Draymond is the second most valuable player on that GS team anyways.  `\Yup, was at the game, still depressing to think about.`\LaSharkus`\Close one. GG`\Yup OKC lose to 2nd team in the West, time to panic.`\damn!`\Say this in the next unpopular opinion thread`\But if Curry shoots a 3 from the top right, he's probably going to make it. If Ariza shoots from the top left, he's probably going to make it. I don't hear you saying otherwise. `\Mills and Parker decided not to guard Lin on that last three.`\Halftime! I will try to get some writing done. `\Sunset orange for life`\take the week to recoup kawhi. `\Even though Hoiberg had a reason to argue, the last thing the Bulls need is to give up another point.  Bad decision.`\don't take them all out at the same time lol`\We actively pursued him the summer before he went to Dallas. I believe Dallas had more money and a bigger role to offer him though so he went there. We were also viewed as on the decline that summer iirc (2011)`\my heart`\If the Spurs win this thunder fans aren't hearing the end of it`\Spurs are just inviting the Wolves to take long-twos, and they're playing right into their hands.`\He's been doing that all March though.`\Good clean game from the guys tonight, glad we come home with at least one win. Is Pop back for the home game?`\Just the other day Seth Partnow and Nate Duncan were talking about empty stats and how all NBA teams get to 90 points and 40 rebounds no matter what. I think the Pelicans perfectly demonstrated that: they weren't especially good and apart from Ajinca, nobody played that well, but somehow they did get to 90.`\All ball on that one `\pretty sure of the few Pacers games ive watched this year, Monta misses that shot`\Well it was fairly obvious the refs wanted it to go to OT`\He does play very well on games but his lack of effort on def/boxing out annoys me. The ball stopped in the post when he tried to 1v1 Duncan which not once worked well.

I like Pau and I like Boozer although they both have issues defending, but replacing one bad player on def with another doesn't mean I can't complain. Boozer was arguably the better fit too as it allowed Noah to defend his natural postion, but who knows Noah wasn't 100% last year.`\100% have Lin instead of the current situation with Melo. However, if done right through FA and free agency, I'd want Melo 10/10 times. However, we've seen that is tougher than it sounds. Between Melo and Lin, I'd rather have Melo in terms of skill and FA draw, disregarding what has actually happened.

But ya, I'd much rather have Lin and a rebuilding/youth movement than what we have with Melo. However, would we get KP? Would we have Phil trying to instill the triangle, or another office/coach with a movement offense that fits Lin? Too many what ifs for both haha


`\I know it's a bit irrational of me, but now I'm curious why do you say that about the Carolinas? `\Oh my Kawhi. `\>baban`\WHY IS MILLS INBOUNDING`\Green/Green`\I think it was mostly Batum's defense. He really stuck with him this game`\this is so obvious and pisses the fuck outta me. PASS HIM THE FUCKING BALL HE HAS A MISMATCH!`\For sure, that was a super clean look he had - they covered the court in what, 4 seconds? We're lucky he delayed a bit too long to get the shot off`\watching diaw play has been very difficult lately`\haha`\I was watching until 28-7, then assuming it would be a blowout I stopped watching.`\"Blown out" by 9 points?`\WRONG FLAIR BRUH`\announcer jinxed the fuck out of him`\My worst nightmare is that Ricky becomes the heir apparent to Tony Parker.

Please Spurs have mercy. We gave you Andre Miller and K-Mart. Have mercy. `\Hmm I guess I haven't been paying attention to the amount of people in these threads but usually any talk about refs gets hella downvotes in my experience `\Andre Miller with the offensive rebound, lol`\It's either them or LeBitch. I prefer the former. `\Kyle's game makes my brain hurt. Dude is so slow but creates soo much separation on every single move. `\I don't believe what i'm seeing!  but in my heart I always knew.`\Aldridge is leasing MJ's mid-range game tonight.  Just red hot.`\2000 wins yay! `\BIIIINGOOO`\Fuck the Clippers.`\Yes!`\Man hornets just won't go away. 3rd seed is ours ok? `\And horrendous D`\It's just such a weak call, especially in the last minute of the game. `\WestBeast needs to get his shit together. Him and Durant are not playing proper basketball in the last quarter.
Kawhi and LMA was fire. Great defense in the 4th.`\Kawhi also ratchets up the defensive intensity.  He tends to sag a bit in the early game, baiting his assignment into long-two, only to smother them in the fourth.`\BATTLE ROYAL!!`\Like Reggie said, it's his body , a lot of bumping down there can take a toll`\would that be Sean Elliot? Sorry, we don't care for him either.`\nope`\hey man we were close as well and happened the same in the last 5 minutes, but we had Butler out, the Thunder are actually good and they just choke away games in the last minutes, how much did RUss go on the last 5 minutes, 0-5, 1 turnover?
