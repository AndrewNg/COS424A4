67,GlobalOffensive,"Posting this to make you all aware of how bad the whole organisation of this tournament is.What actually happenedMyself and four friends entered the UK Premiership Spring 2016 CS:GO Qualifier today (14/03/2016). Our first match was against a team named AImperii.When the game was organised, we quickly jumped on the ESL Wire chat and discussed the server not being provided by ESL. We were then given a server by the other team to join. Our fifth took a while to join as he was not able to connect, giving him an error stating bad password despite the fact that the password was correct. The server was set up to play Dust 2. Upon joining we stated that we did not want to play Dust 2 for the official match. We proceed to wait for the remaining players to join before discussing the map pool + veto. We were not made aware of the fact that deciding the map was not done officially so we used ESL Wire to state which maps we wanted to play. Our final decision (made by both teams) was Overpass.Server was restarted and the map was set to Overpass.Our fifth joined and we played the knife round. My screenshots of the match. We won the knife round and went CT. We lost a few rounds, came back to a decent-ish score. During the second half of the game (this is where the fun bit is), two random people joined the server. After this, the opposite team left the server and we proceeded to win the gameWe opened a protest on ESL and the response we received was an absolute disgrace to the eSports community. See for yourself - entire transcript. The admin that replied was [HolyCupcake].Feel free to review the evidence yourself from the match pageTL;DR: We joined an ESL tournament, enemy team left mid way through the game, claimed they won, admin didn't check evidence properly and sided with them despite us having sufficient evidence that we won.

220,GlobalOffensive,"Hello everybody, I would like to address a few ideas/suggestions for CS:GO along with discussing the current state with community support. Recently, I have been thinking about how to improve CS:GO. However, we first need to list the current issues with Valve’s support for community servers. Custom Weapon Model Bans & GSLT System
In the last couple months, Valve started banning CS:GO game servers if they violated their guidelines posted here. Back in the summer of 2015, we did provide stock CS:GO knives. At the time, this was allowed and it made players happy. When Valve notified all the server owners on the CS:GO servers mailing list that these plugins will result in a GSLT ban, we immediately removed the specific knife plugins. However, a few months later, somebody developed a plugin that gave players custom weapon models (not sold on the CS:GO market). Seeing this opened up a lot of potential and customization in the game and thus we added this plugin to our servers. Originally, we thought this wasn’t against the guidelines (it shouldn’t be). Nonetheless, it sadly is. Valve, why is it against the rules to provide players with custom knives not sold on the CS:GO market? I can understand the stock CS:GO knives being against the rules, but custom weapon models? These should definitely be allowed, especially when Valve’s public image is a company that highly supports community-made content. Currently, Valve’s public image is highly false and misleading to me.With that said, the banning system they have developed is poorly made as well. Honestly, they most likely spent a total of two hours developing this system. Here is a list of things wrong with the banning system itself:Doesn’t tell you which server triggered the detection and the reason for the ban.Permanently bans your account from hosting servers again. The first ban should definitely be temporary.No warnings ahead of time.Finally, the CS:GO developers themselves failed to communicate properly on the subject. Important questions about this system are still unanswered to this day. Overall, this system is a joke in my eyes and it is an embarrassment to Valve. Server owners definitely deserve better. Exploits Left Unpatched For Months
Recently, there have been occasional server exploits going around. A specific exploit existed for around two months and was mentioned to the CS:GO developers multiple times. Moreover, it wasn’t patched until a couple months after the original report. This isn’t the first Valve game that delayed exploit patches. Older Valve games had exploits that were left unpatched for months and possibly years after the original report.Most of the time, exploits are patched when it starts affecting Valve’s servers or becomes a common thing (e.g. Popular Reddit thread). To me and many others, that is ridiculous. Security is very important and when exploits are left unpatched for months without any communication from Valve, there’s definitely a major problem. Linux Limitation & Other Small Things
I’ve e-mailed Valve multiple times about a Linux limitation which highly decreases server performance on popular CS:GO Linux servers. Somewhat expectedly, I received no response as usual. There have been other things I and many others have suggested to Valve. It goes without saying that our thoughts have been ignored. Conclusion
To conclude, I believe Valve’s support for community servers is at an all-time low and yet continues to wane. At this point, I feel as though Valve only cares about the amount of money they’re making from their games. Ideas
Now that my rant is over, it is time to start talking about some great ideas that will improve CS:GO. The ideas will be listed below. Server Browser
I believe a new and improved server browser would really help out community servers in CS:GO. The current server browser appears to be heavily outdated and doesn’t match the CS:GO color theme. Currently, the server browser is gray which doesn’t match the blue-ish main menu theme. I also believe that making two separate layouts for the server browser would make it feel more modern. The two layouts will be listed below. Complex Layout
In the complex layout, community game modes will be listed. When you click on one of said game modes, the menu will expand to show all the servers running the specific game mode. Some examples of game modes include: Zombie Escape, Zombie Mod, Surf Timer, Bunny Hop, etc. This would be similar to the Garry’s Mod server browser. However, instead of relying on a text file for the game mode, it would depend on the map prefix.Ze_ - Zombie EscapeZm_ - Zombie ModSurf_ - Surf Timer or Surf DeathmatchBhop_ - Bunny HopDe_ - Defuse (or whatever you call it).Cs_ - Hostages.Etc… Simple Layout
The simple layout would basically work as the current server browser, although the color scheme and style would need to be changed to fit CS:GO’s. There is currently also a ~5000 cap on the amount of servers the server browser can display. On paper, this does sound relatively high. That being said, there are around ~50K community servers. I believe uncapping the ~5000 cap would be beneficial and would increase the chances of the players seeing every server on the server browser (as it should be). To conclude, a new and improved server browser would be a big step in strengthening the support for community servers. This idea has been proposed before, but as usual, nothing has been done by the CS:GO developers. We are currently looking into making the server browser using HTML, JavaScript, etc. If you are interested in helping us in this project, please reply to this thread!. Quick Play For Community Servers
First, quick play is the traffic from players using the “Find a game” option in CS:GO (which a majority of the player base chiefly uses).The next thing I want to talk about is quick play support for community servers. Currently, community servers do not receive traffic from the quick play system. Even if your server runs vanilla game play and even a better gaming experience than Valve (e.g. 128 tick), you can only rely on players finding your server through the server browser, friends list, or connecting through the console. From what I’ve heard, an option to be put into community servers using quick play did exist initially, although it has since been removed. I am estimating around 85% of the CS:GO player base to only be using the quick play system (most likely haven’t discovered the server browser).With that said, I would like to address another concern for community servers. Currently, players do not gain XP while playing on community servers. This also serves to drive players away from community servers. The only valid reason I can think of not allowing players to gain XP on community servers is the possibility of farming XP. However, farming XP is difficult and considered pointless due to CS:GO’s current way of handling XP (e.g. XP is already limited and the more the player plays CS:GO, the less XP they will gain). Even so, simply enabling XP on community servers running stock maps would aid said community servers. Small Issues
I want to address a few small issues that I believe would strengthen CS:GO upon being fixed. These are mostly issues that have existed for a long time (I have sent Valve most of these issues in the past, though, no results). Player Names Not Showing While Aiming On Large Servers
When you aim at players, it should display their name (just like the old CS games). However, in CS:GO, this feature is broken for servers with above 32 players. It doesn’t matter what mp_playerid is set to; the feature eventually breaks. This appears to only break with teammates. Feel free to watch this YouTube video to see the issue itself. Linux Limitation
As mentioned in the past, CS:GO linux servers perform poorly, especially for large servers. This is due to CS:GO linux servers not using the networking thread like Windows does. More information can be found in this mailing list thread. Many server owners would prefer to use Linux instead of Windows (me included) for personal reasons. With the aforementioned limitation, most cannot use Linux if they are hosting large servers due to the bad performance. New Skeleton/Hitboxes Performance Issues
To be honest, I cannot confirm this is the issue because I am not a modeler myself. However, a couple of modelers I have spoken to said that player models compiled with the new skeletons/hit boxes do decrease performance on large servers especially when these newer models are taking damage (bullets penetrating the player). I’ve tried testing this myself, although I cannot find a difference when testing with bots. Though, when we replaced our player models compiled with the new skeletons/hitboxes with player models compiled with the older skeletons/hitboxes, server performance increased by 15%.  TL;DR
Valve’s support for community servers is at an all-time low and still decreasing. Since Valve is apparently listening now, I just wanted to throw out suggestions and ideas that would most likely improve CS:GO. I hope we can get some constructive discussions going, and hopefully get a response from Valve, so that we may see a better community experience. Remember, the game developers aren’t the only ones to blame in Valve for this mess.Feel free to give feedback (e.g. better ways to improve the server browser, etc)!Thank you for reading.",28,https://www.reddit.com/r/GlobalOffensive/comments/4by0o1,Valve's Poor Support For Community Servers And Lack Of Communication,"If they can't monetize it, they won't invest on it.

771,GlobalOffensive,"Hello guys,my name is J0hnny, I have played CS:GO since it came out and been to many lans and events. I've played for teams like myKPV.de, mousesports or KILLERFISH.I've got a big problem. 
My CS feels really weird, it's really hard to explain, but I will try.I have 300-400 FPS whenever I play, but even with 300 FPS when I move my mouse around ingame it feels laggy or more likely like it stutters. It's not smooth at all.
And whenever theres a smoke on the ground everything feels slower.I have played some events (for example Major Lan Qualifier in Cologne or APM Season 1) and it never happened there.My PC Specs:
CPU: Intel i5-4670kMotherboard: ASRock Z97 Pro3GPU: MSI GeForce GTX 970Monitor: ASUS VG248QEOS: Windows 10 64 BitMouse: Zowie FK2 (1000hz & 400dpi)In-Game:
Resolution: 1024x768 (with Blackbars)Monitor-HZ: 144hzLaunch Options: -console -novid -freq 144I replaced my GPU, Mouse, Power Supply and Monitor recently to see if thats the case but it wasn't since it's still there.I tried to overclock my CPU with help from someone who knows his shit about it but it didnt help.
Tried Windows 7, 8 and 10 and nothing works better than the other.I keep my Windows very clean, no pointless apps, drivers or anything else, i keep it very clean, believe me :DI tried so many things, but nothing helps. Forgive me if I forgot to write down some things.
I hope you can understand what the problem is, its hard to explain but to be short about it, everything feels laggy, stuttery and my mousemovement is kinda slow, not a good smooth feeling overall.nvidia settings:http://i.imgur.com/91ZwCOV.jpg http://i.imgur.com/IyiEGJs.jpg     !!!!BIG EDIT!!!!
My game doesnt actually run with 50FPS and 60hz, it just FEELS like that.
I play with 144hz(10000000% sure), turned on vsync and only got 144hz ingame, so i clearly run 144hz.
Most of the time I get 300FPS and it feels weird, not smooth, more like much slower.
It's like that: if I have a duel, 1v1 gunfight in a 5v5 game, the opponent most likely has an advantage because it FEELS like my gun shoots slower and the game doesnt reg my shots.I TRIED THESE THINGSReplaced EVERYTHING except CPU.EVERY driver is UP-TO-DATECant count how many times I reinstalled (format c:) windows/csgo, played with default config, no launch options, tried every launch option there is in the game one by one.Tried every DPI setting there is and also mousehztried every RES there is in the game, Blackbars/Stretched/Fullscreenit really is mysterious, but I know some other pro players who have this issue and it's really hard to explain it the perfect the way since you need to sit in my chair and play from it to see how it is. thats why I dont think a video with for example an iPhone would showcase the problem.DPC Latency Check (LatencyMon for Win10) 2 time check while playing deathmatch on a full server:http://i.imgur.com/EtEAy41.jpghttp://i.imgur.com/12zJLIb.jpgVideo Settings: http://i.imgur.com/ccf1nBF.jpgNVIDIA Settings (sorry in german): http://imgur.com/a/fTfFKHeres a Clip...nothing special, happens to everyone, right? But I know that when my game feels slower I miss shots even though I'm on the enemy, and I heard it so MANY times that my mates told me while spectating me, that I'm a 100% on the enemy but the game doesn't register my shot....

Please stop doing it. You are only wasting money since you are going to derank eventually back to your real rank anyway, and you are ruining the game for everybody else.

I have collected information from the most popular Q&A threads from top pro players mainly from EU. I have rephrased the questions and put the answers for your improvement and pleasure. Every tip is worthy information from players in every skill group from Silver 1 to top ESEA teams, all comments are the direct text answer, nothing edited (except for capital letters). Every thread is linked as a source so whomever who wants, can go and read, every thread is a good read :D
 So here we go, you are more than welcome to suggest additions from other players + threads.This thread was created 1 year ago, however, it is a lot of mental questions making it still relevant.Tips for global wanting to take it to next levelJust try pugging with people at ESEA/Faceit and whenever you get the chance to play with or against good players, act nice, dont be toxic and try to communicate as good as possible so that they might want to play with you again. Other than that you just need to get lucky i would say. I never really pushed it over ""the edge"" i made my own team with the people that i enjoyed playing with that had the same mindset and skill as myself, and thats how i got to be where i am today. Lycka till!fnatic praticeJust playing scrims versus other top teams, when we do mistakes or try out new things we talk about what went wrong and what we should do different next time. Other than that we just go through new strats and positioning/defense.ConsistencyI think my consistency lies in me not really going for the stupid risky plays rather than holding back, getting one or two frags and then just playing it safe. Also not relying on aiming to get frags, i prefer using flashes/smokes/grenades to get an edge in the duels.How to handle pressure of audiences I never had the issue with having nerves playing in front of audiences, i just zoned them out and just played my game. Mentally improving in CS (Attitude & mindset)Always strive to keep learning, looking at other players what they are doing good and what they are doing badly. And always try to think one step ahead of the enemy, e g if you throw a smoke at a certain place what will they expect you to do and so on. Also the opposite, if they throw a smoke at a certain place what do you think they are going to do and so on. Also you should really never play while you are tilted or mad since that will only make you do dumb stuff and perhaps make you think the game is less fun.Should i keep playing ESEA even though i get flamed on?I definitely think you should play ESEA or faceit over matchmaking, but the thing that will make you improve the most is getting a team and scrimming other teams to get the sense of how to counter other teams and getting the teamwork that is required to win matches in this game. Thank you, and good luck to you at Faceit/ESEA ;)Mindset in clutch situationsClutch or kick every time..How to improve if you want to go proEvery time you play you should just try to have fun while still learning new things and actually spectating others while you are dead to see what they do good and what they do bad, thats the way i kept getting better.Practicing 5v5 vs DM (Gamesense vs aim)5v5 99% of the time, and i would say its your gamesense. you can get to like LEM/SMFC without actually aiming that good^SOURCE: [https://www.reddit.com/r/GlobalOffensive/comments/2se0ft/fnatic_flusha_ama/?]Submitted 3 moths ago, i know swag is banned, he is however still a highly skilled player and could potentially have become one of the GOATsHow to take gunfightsI try not to take a gun battle without an advantage, or a reason to take it unless I'm just feeling confident. I use everything in my power to out play the enemy, whether its positioning, nade usage, or just a teammate. I feel like this a problem in NA CS. People feel the need to take aim battles with no reasoning behind it and just die for nothing.Developing gamesenseI never really watched demos, In 1.6 I used to play ESEA Pugs all day, and I was a huge ""baiter"" at the time. This gave me a ton of chances to clutch over and over, and after a while you can paint a picture in each situation of where the enemies will be or go. Some people need to think more like, ""If I was a CT and this just happened, where would I go? etc."" I feel the only thing I can learn from a demos is a strat for the team, or like a new flash or smoke, you shouldn't try to copy someone else's playstyle.Keeping skill up to par + warmupI still play 10mans on a regular basis with pros, and I think that helps a lot. Obviously it's not the same as playing with a team, so the environment is different, but I think it shows how skilled you are individually rather than with a team. I also deathmatch to warmup and just stay on point when I can.ImprovingFind a play style that suits you, and find out what shots/peeks your comfortable taking and try to always force the enemy into your ""comfort zone"".On becoming the Juan Deag master    One bullet at a time.How to get into pro sceneESEA & playing vs pros.

Don't you fear that by putting yourself out there, you can possibly get picked and create a losing scenario for your team early on?""I have to credit my team alot for that, i mean ofcourse people can spectate me when im being ""off"" and say that im playing dumb counter-strike but my team always trust me in my ideas and everything i do, which makes me believe alot more in myself. You cant really think too much when you play like that, because if you think too much you will not succeed. Only times i ""think"" about it is probably when we are down maybe 15-14 and I should play safe, but yeah. Alot of credit to my team for believing in me. And when i look thru my year as a pro I would say that i am making more advantages for my team than disadvantages so i would say im pretty good at it.How to train AWP aimJust play, play, play pretty much, theres no shortcuts. Play some Deathmatch to get ""hot"" and then play for example gathers, pugs or whatever to train on your positions with it and stuff that you want to get better at (For example taking entry kills)How to play against better playersYou can never be in a game and think that any of the opponents is better then you or faster then you, you have to believe that you are better then them and that you are the best, if you dont believe in yourself, how should you then succeed?Warmup and practiceI play about 100 frags Deathmatch just to get ""hot"" before going in to my personal/team practice, playing with the team we obviously scrim against other topteams and when i train individually I just play gathers, mixes and stuff like that so i still play 5v5 and get to train on my positions etc.SOURCE:https://www.reddit.com/r/GlobalOffensive/comments/2pw1if/fnatic_jw_ama/?sort=qa5 months old and very relevant.NBK : I just want the most hours as I can on CS.

Some FPL here and there.Evolving as a support player (NBK)It naturally came that way. Working with Happy changed my point of view about the game, focusing a lot on the team aspect. We are working well on our bombsites, and I count on the fact that if I get the hard role done of surviving and getting a kill or two, knowing how Happy is gonna kill everyone, Im happy with it. It´s a big ""trust"" relationship with him on the CT side. Regarding T sides, I just want to put my teammates in a good spot for them to make the kills, because I trust my own abilities of outplaying my opponents in all the special small situations by thinking fast or making the right choices.

Haha I dont know how to answer this question besides playing alot, i have always felt like playing gathers/praccs/mm etc is much better then DM because you learn all the angles, were to hold your crosshair and where u can expect people to be. For me DM is just random and its just feels like i get killed from the side or the back all the time :DTips for going proPlay with a solid lineup that u like to play with and play everything.Should low tier pratice aim or watching pro VODs?I always think that teamplay/communication/understanding of the game etc is more important then raw aim so i would vote for vods!Communication when playing poorly and who gets the team back on trackWell we are mostly calm during our games but sometimes we can get a little bit to emotinoal, something we have been talking about and are working on! But i would say probably say Devilwalk.How much practice?We usually practice from sunday to thursday from 18-22/23 with 1 hour break for food.

2138,GlobalOffensive,"LOS ANGELES - Alex ""s1mple"" Kostyliev steps out of the roaring arena into the comparative quiet of the locker room that his Los Angeles Liquid share with their sister franchise - the Los Angeles Lakers of the struggling and diminished National Basketball Association.  One would expect him to be overjoyed after winning the Counter-Strike: Universal Offensive MLGMTG World Championship 2025, but it is nothing new to him - this will be his fifth ring, a record matched only by his coach and former teammate Spencer ""Hiko"" Martin.  Kostyliev has come a long way from the divisive Ukrainian import of nearly a decade ago.  He is an American citizen now, and changed his name to the more Westernized ""Alex"".  The accent of his homeland?  Nearly erased after years of speech classes and FACEIT Pro League trash talk sessions.  He is one of the most recognizable figures on the planet, and counts Nike, Under Armor, McDonald's and Gatorade amongst his long list of endorsements.  Underneath the polish that age and maturity has brought him though, he is still a demon in the server, tearing apart the opposition with his rifle and railgun alike.He does not even seem to register the gaggle of reporters around him, peppering him with questions.  What does he think of the new Commissioner?: ""[Commissioner] Duncan [Shields] is a great friend of mine, and shepherded us through the transition from Global Offensive to CS:UO - and there weren't even skins until a year after launch!  I am sad to see him retire, but know that incoming Commissioner Gares is a worthy replacement"".    When asked how it feels to return to Liquid after a short stint with rivals New York Evil Genius: ""Los Angeles was my first home when I came to the United States - I am staying here for good this time.  But I appreciate everything that [Evil Genius CEO] Jordan [Gilbert] did for me during my time there!"".    On Valve's level of support for the game: ""I'm disappointed we still don't have glove skins"".    His decade-old feud with Rio Luminosity player Tacio ""TACO"" Filho: ""TACO and I are actually great friends, we spend holidays on each other's yachts"".    And the feud with Ryan ""FREAKAZOID"" Abadir: ""Ryan and I also get along great, as you can see I did get a tan, and he gave me a great workout plan"".    Finally, on the rumors that he is gathering an investor group to purchase a minority stake in LA Liquid: ""No comment"".After graciously answering questions for over an hour, s1mple states that is all for the night because he would like to get home to see his girlfriend Kendall Jenner and their 2-year old son.  He exits the locker room into the darkened garage for player cars - a familiar experience for him, since he is always the first to arrive for team practice and the last to leave.As he walks to his yellow and blue Ferrari (he is still Ukrainian at heart, after all), he is stunned to realize he recognizes one of the parking attendants - ""James, is that you?"".  The man formerly known as GB James replies affirmatively, saying that times have been hard ever since Liquid fired him and he was unable to obtain another coaching job.  Before getting into his car and driving off, Kostyliev hands him $1,000 in cash and his personal hologram number, telling him to call if he ever needs anything.NEXT WEEK: Look forward to a profile of Counter-Strike's new commissioner (and dog lover!), Sean Gares Inspired by: https://twitter.com/JeanieBuss/status/707386777619697665",26,https://www.reddit.com/r/GlobalOffensive/comments/49msht,Counter-Strike in 2025: A s1mple Story,"Not happening, what a shitpost tolkien",http://reddit.com/r/GlobalOffensive/comments/49msht/c/d0t4dbv,480,7

A big part of that was actually owning a PC, but that took a while as well.For a little background, I am your classic case of a lifetime Xbox/COD player transitioning to PC/CS:GO. This basically means I know nothing.After playing the tutorial and shooting some bots, I decided to start off with some TDM to figure out how to actually play the game. When I joined, the entire lobby was talking and making jokes (which used to happen in COD, not anymore). I finally figured out how to talk in the lobby, and expressed how new I was.Almost right away, everyone in the lobby started telling me about the game, asking me questions, and giving me tips. Once the game ended, a few of the guys sent me friend requests, and even took me to a lobby to show me how the recoil works and different training methods.I guess I just wanted to share how cool of an experience that was, given some of my hesitation to get started. If any of you are those types of people, my hats off to you. I'm pumped to jump back on the game tonight and learn more.TL;DR I am a classic console player transitioning to PC/CS:GO.

He actually rarely calls, and doesn't give strats all too often. The main cause of their recent performance is that Drew [Irukandji] simply slightly tweaked their strats, and made them adjust their timings. He also said that Drew's absence at the major won't hurt them severely, but might affect them if they fall into a steep round deficit. Drawing off on that point, shroud said that Drew's biggest point of assistance and his talent was identifying problems and understanding how to fix them on the spot, like when c9 are down several rounds. This is why they have made so many comebacks from unfavorable positions recently.

2474,GlobalOffensive,"UPDATE: OP WILDFIRE AND OP BLOODHOUND STORY ADDED. NEED FEEDBACK.Please set your filter to new posts first, i might do some posting into the comments section.Okay. Hello everyone. This is my first post here, and i wanted to make this as interesting as possible. So! Today and in the following weeks i will try to make a complete post about the plot of CS:GO. Enjoy!
If you have suggestions/corrections, write them down, into the comments section.THIS POST CONTAINS POTENTIAL SPOILERS!!If you want to help, post comics from OP Wildfire/OP Bloodhound or any interesting Weapon Texts you find. Thanks!Okay, so from the start of OP Bloodhound (The one with the Falchion knife), Valve has been adding Flavor Text to some picked skins (e.g. the M4A4 | Griffin). These give us some information about the coherent storyline of CS:GO. So, what do we know?1.) BasicsWe know that currently, as of 01.03.2016 there are two main opponents - The Phoenix Connexion (T Side) and The Coalition Taskforce (Coalition Taskforce is the CT side, yet CT still stands for Counter-Terrorist!)
Then we also have the Mercenary group; The Elite Crew. They are involved in the plot and work with the Phoenix.1.2.) Basics - Leaders and other important peoplePhoenix:Phoenix Motto: Rebuilding only comes in the wake of destruction (Not sure about this one.)Then we have Naomi, which is her Bodyguard. She is very loyal, perhaps the most loyal to Valeria amongst the Phoenix. Naomi understands that she must die for Valeria once. (Quote: Of all the members of The Phoenix, none are more loyal to Valeria than her bodyguard Naomi) We have Javier Alviso (Fist of the Phoenix), which is an Ex-Soldier, who interrogates the hostages. He executes them afterwards.Franz Kriegeld. He uses the Phoenix as a sword to destroy competitors in the Industry business. He is the Phoenix Tactician. (he might be a minimalist according to his text) (Quote: There is beauty in simplicity - Franz Kriegeld, Phoenix Tactician)Elliot - Mercenary, indirect connection w/ the Phoenix Connexion. We see him talking with Franz on the phone. (Quote: You worry too much, Elliot. I pay you to blow up buildings, not to offer opinions.) Apparently, Elliot worries too much and Franz tells him that everything is going according to plan. Leader of a Merc group? Leader of the 1337 Crew, confirmed!Chase Turner - Sebastien Hennequet is/was coming for him, which he tells Valeria together with the fact that they dont have much time. (Chase betrayed the CT, he was the old Sniper and close friend of Hennequet). Dies during OP Bloodhound. (By Sebastien/Player.) (Thank you, AgentPaint! :3)Sergei - Killed during OP Bloodhound by the player. Lower ranked Phoenix operative.Coalition Taskforce:Felix Riley is the Commanding Officer, he is hard to break (Interrogation) and his team is from all over the world. People often question the team, but never the results.The next one is Kotoro Izaki, a Breach Expert. Manipulated by someone? Likes Shotguns.Carmen Cocinero, the Extraction expert. (Quote: I can follow procedure and get 7 out, or I can do it my way and save all 10... your choice)Then there is Alex Kincade, who is in the Phoenix compound, captured during OP Vanguard. He is a Journalist, but has an indirect connection with the Coalition Taskforce (Intel on Valeria). Lieutenant Rona Sabri. She is very young and very good, yet she tells that to everyone she meets. Rona uses the M4A1-S and CZ-75 as her signature weapons, under the ""Nitro"" skin. (Thanks EpochDigitalis! :D)Sebastien Hennequet - Sniper. Known. Gives you missions during Bloodhound Marksman.The Player - reffered to as Jackson in OP Bloodhound by ValeriaElite (1337) Crew:Neutral/Arms dealers:We have Booth, which is the Arms Dealer. Booth can be seen as a type of exotic weapons dealer, (Quote: Every year, Booth gathers the worlds foremost Gunsmiths to show off their latest designs). Booth is neutral. (He even tells Felix Riley about the fact that Valeria wants to start a war with the Taskforce).Imogen is also an Arms Dealer (in training), yet it seems like she is sided with either way the Phoenix or The Coalition Taskforce, or atleast from the texts i have read (In OP Wildfire we get proof that Imogen is indeed sided with the Coalition Taskforce, so that must mean she has been loyal to the Phoenix before). Imogen has the same eye for quality as her father, yet is even more ambitious.Lord William
Owns the Castle on Cobblestone. Assasinated by Turner in OP: Bloodhound. Seems to have funded the Coalition Taskforce. Political supporter of the Coalition Taskforce. Camped on big tower on T Spawn, shot down every operator. In OP Wildfire, Lord Williams hometown became a high profile target for Valeria. Possible Gemini mission.
(THANKS TO quotingmc! :D)Nicknames from flavour texts. Some known, some unknown:KNOWNCoalition TaskforceThe Oni - Izaki. Likes shotguns, his son was killed with one.The Valkyrie is Carmen Cocinero.The Teacher - Sebastien Hennequet.The Palladin - Felix Riley.PHOENIX CONNEXIONThe Shield - Naomi.The Traitor - Chase Turner.The Serpent - Franz Kriegeld.The Truthseeker - Javier Alviso. (Quote: You don't know Felix Riley like I do... the man is impossible to break)The Phoenix - Valeria. Interrogating Kincade w/ The Storyteller. Both from the Phoenix. Talking to the Father about Imogen.The Storyteller - Javier or Franz?NEUTRALS/ARMS DEALERSUNKNOWN1.3.) Facts that may come in handy later.We know that according to Naomi, Franz wants to kill Valeria and he cannot be trusted.Imogen has been marked for death by Valeria.Franz and Valeria argue all the time.People are manipulating Kotoro Izaki (without him realizing it?). This indicates that he might be very submissive.According to Valeria, the Phoenix doesn't destroy, it purifies things and makes the world better. (Phoenix Connexion = Anarchists)Javier is brutal and executes those he Interrogates after he has gotten the intel.. (Quote: Valeria doesn't pay Javier to ask questions, she pays him to pry out questions Everyone has a story, and Javier will pry it out before he kills you)(Quote: Gonzo journalist Alex Kincaide disappeared after traveling to The Maghreb to cover Operation Vanguard)(Quote: What do you mean you can't find Cocinero and Izaki?) Cocinero and Izaki are operating without Rileys consent. (Thank you, LZH14!)(Quote: You should smile Felix, you'd have more luck with the ladies if you didn't look like such a dour bastard all the time) Indicator of Imogen's betrayal, perhaps Riley is pessimistic?(Quote: With Turner dead, we have a new priority: rescue Alex Kincaide) Riley wanted to save Turner. The Coalition Taskforce knew about him? Maybe he had intel?2.) OP VanguardLet us start with the OP that started it all. Vanguard. During this OP, Alex Kincade gets kidnapped and is being held captive in the Phoenix Compound. You will save him during the Gemini missions in OP Wildfire.3.) OP Bloodhound*TIMELINE (WIP)The Player gets trained by Sebastien Hennequet in terms of playing/shooting with the AWP. First, Sebastien sends him after small terrorist groups, then after the Phoenix which leads to the death of Chase Turner. 4.) OP WildfireGEMINITIMELINEAfter Chase Turner dies, The Coalition Taskforce uses the current weakness of The Phoenix which leads to breaching and rescuing Alex Kincade after 3 years in the Phoenix compound. Franz gets word of this and goes to talk to Valeria. He gives her proof about Imogen's betrayal. Valeria and Naomi fly to Imogen's place. Booth somehow also knows and informs her. (This is a speculation: Imogen informs the Taskforce, they extract her and booby-trap the place.) Valeria and Naomi fall into the trap, however they don't die. Two of the Coalition's operators get executed by Naomi. Then we know that the Phoenix want to destroy a nuclear facility. To be continued.5.)

2676,GlobalOffensive,"Hello people of /r/GlobalOffensive. So, I've been dealing with a constant depression for many years already, and lately, due to movement to another place, people turning away from me, and basically lack of any perspectives in life it was getting worse and worse. I've been constantly thinking how shit I am. It got to the point when I was convinced that I wasn't just meant to have any friends near me, never will be just invited to hang out or even talk about something. The worst thing is that I'm not even a stereotypical fat ugly loser, just a lot of years of bullying and isolation from society in my previous place completely destroyed all the social skills I had. After my best friend commited suicide two years ago, I've been dealing with all of this shit alone.Today, well... a lot of sad stuff happened, and I was pretty sure it's my last day on this planet. Had almost everything ready to say ""fuck it"" and hang myself, when I thought about Counter-Strike. I played GO for more than a year already, and even when I had a bad game, it helped me relieve from constant stress and feel a tiny bit better.  So, if I was still going to take my life, why not play  my last competitive game? I was matched with a team of solo-queueing Russians, though they didn't say a single word in Russian, but the accent was noticeable. I had like the worst aim and reaction time ever because of my emotional condition, but they never flamed me, and, as the game went by, I felt better and better, concentrating on it completely, and even won a 1vs3 clutch in the end :) We managed to win and I even got ranked up. Closed the game and thought that, maybe, tomorrow will be better. I gave it another chance, and who knew what could have happened if I didn't decide to play a match. Thank you CS:GO community for simply existing, and devs for making such a game. You're amazing.

3676,GlobalOffensive,"Day 1 was thoroughly entertaining, and a lot of that was to do with the analyst desk once again.It wasnt as great in Katowice for reasons, but at MLG, Richard Lewis is just superb at hosting. His knowledge is excellent, he has the skills to bring others onto the desk with excellent conversation flow and tremendous banter. Its got to the point now that the desk is far more entertaining than the play itself.Some say hes better at host or on the desk, either way hes just incredible at both, probably the best in either role in esports. Critics will be harsh of his ""banter"", but I'l say its the millenial attitude of ""everyone is a winner"". Richard got a lot of hate on Twitter last night because of their harsh comments on Splyce, I'l say hes just a fan of the upmost elite of competitive play, a connoisseur so to speak, and average teams deserve to be hung out to dry.I hope he becomes a standard of all CSGO majors, great job Richard. It shows what hard work can do. He spent a lot of time trying to help the League community, and they collectively hounded him out, attempting to ruin his career. Its ironic now that most CSGO tournaments generally trump League in terms of viewers, with Lewis one of the main reasons for CS' popularity. Im sure the usual League fan will come in here and spout off shit about him being ""mental unstable"" but to me he seems like a decent guy, his shows are great and insightful, and he always RTs me when I praise him for his work on twitter. I hope MLG gives him a game or two to cast too, would like him to be able to showcase his talents in that too. A general jack of all trades.Edit- Swarms of downvotes came in. Good to see the League, Dota and Starcraft subreddits still salty about Lewis doing well. League is probably upset he is gaining high viewership, and attempting to ensure he gets no good press at all. Pathetic. Dota fans still upset that he battered one of their top players after he was the one that challenged Richard.

3700,GlobalOffensive,"IT HAS COME TO MY ATTENTION THAT I WAS NOT THE FIRST PERSON TO FIND THIS, BUT I WON'T REMOVE THE POST AS I BELIEVE IT GIVES FURTHER INSIGHT AND MORE EVIDENCE TO AN INFERNO REMAKELast week Valve published an FAQ about all the new lighting effects. Inside this FAQ there are a lot of pictures and accompanying text, with some referencing features that can be used for a new map, or a remaster of a pre-existing map. This wouldn't be the first time Valve has teased something by releasing an article showcasing new features by using a picture of the unreleased content (Train bullet penetration, Nuke player hitboxes, and now this).First, this picture here: http://i.imgur.com/1izY8JB.png  seems to show a never before seen tile texture. Personally I think this is hinting towards Inferno, but it's up for interpretation. I have searched hammer for that texture and was unable to find it anywhere, re-confirming this to be a brand new texture.But while I was searching around I discovered some textures referencing Inferno. The interesting part about these textures is not only the fact that the textures themselves are missing, but that they mainly consist of blend textures. Blend textures are textures that can only be used on displacements, and, blend two textures. I say it's interesting that the only textures are displacements because in the same article Valve released, they corrected displacement features and lighting, small thing, but worth noting.Continuing the texture related stuff, the locations of the textures are VERY exciting. The locations of the textures are in the path of ""cobblestone/hr_c/inferno"", ""plaster/hr_p/inferno"", and ""brick/hr_brick/inferno"". This is exciting because ONLY new maps have the path of ""hr"" in them. ""hr"" is an abbreviation for high resolution and again, is only used in new maps such as Nuke, Train, and Crashsite. I will now proceed to explain the significance of each texture directory because it IS very important. Firstly, the only two sub-folders inside ""hr_brick"" are crashsite, and inferno, the significance again being these would both be new maps. Okay, now the importance of the ""hr_c"" location. This is mostly important because it is inside a brand new folder named ""cobblestone"". This folder is not referencing the map cobblestone, but the textures it contains, which would be literal cobblestones. Cobblestone textures would easily link into the ground of Inferno being made of cobblestone. Finally, the location of ""plaster/hr_p/inferno"" is again, using the new ""hr_"" prefix indicating brand new textures and of course Inferno having interior walls consisting almost exclusively of plaster.Now that all the texture stuff is out of the way, the final part of the article Valve released mentions how they have added the ability for more lighting detail to be applied to textures. The picture, shown here: http://i.imgur.com/1JiO1Jv.png  shows a brick texture, possibly a complete texture of what is already in the game. I don't have the exact quote since counter-strike.net is down, but I remember it saying that ""this effect is best with plaster peeling off of bricks"". This is very big considering what I've already explained above and the fact that we already possibly have incomplete versions of these textures already in the game. Another thing to note is the above picture looks like it belongs in Source 2. Please discuss and upvote if you think I am on the right trail!The full names of the files in the game are listed here (you can look them up in hammer):brick/hr_brick/inferno/flagstone_dbrick/hr_brick/inferno/flagstone_d_blendcobblestone/hr_c/inferno/cobblestone_acobblestone/hr_c/inferno/cobblestone_a_blend3cobblestone/hr_c/inferno/cobblestone_cconcrete/hr_c/inferno/concrete_aplaster/hr_p/inferno/plaster_a_blendplaster/hr_p/inferno/plaster_b_blendplaster/hr_p/inferno/plaster_e_blendplaster/hr_p/inferno/plaster_g_blendplaster/hr_p/inferno/plaster_iplaster/hr_p/inferno/plaster_i_blendIn case the files are removed, here is a picture: http://i.imgur.com/puP1e7R.pngEDIT 1: Added texture names, added picture for proof of textures, and attempted to fix random italics

4332,GlobalOffensive,"Many people are requesting for a system to get the BOT to drop their weapon, much similar to how interacting with them causes them to drop the bomb. The flaw with a system like this would be that when a player leaves, the BOT gets their own pool of money, separate from the player who disconnected, starting from $800 and building up. The BOT uses this money to buy utility and weapons for itself.Now here is the problem; currently, when the player who disconnected re-joins, he ""destroys"" the BOT's money pool and its items, and the reconnected player starts with basic pistol, and the money he would have received in the rounds that he missed. This means that with the requested system you could make the BOT drop his weapon, and if the player re-joins within a certain time you would effectively have a free weapon from the BOT's cash pile, plus the reconnected player will be able to buy one of their own. This has potential to be exploited for extra weapons, since you will have 6 players worth of economy indirectly.The only way I can see round this is only letting BOTs drop weapons they have picked up, but this still allows an effective extra weapon to be carried when the player re-joins. If anyone has another solution to this problem, please comment, as it would be nice to see some other opinions on this problem! It would otherwise be a great feature to the game, since you may control a BOT and want to save a weapon, which you cannot access currently unless you die yourself.TL;DR - BOT's buy weapon, BOT's drop weapon, player re-joins with lots of extra money and a free weapon from the BOT's money.",51,https://www.reddit.com/r/GlobalOffensive/comments/48uo4t,Why BOTs will NEVER be able to drop weapons.,"The problem isn't that the bot used all your money, the problem is that you don't want a negev.",http://reddit.com/r/GlobalOffensive/comments/48uo4t/c/d0mtmz7,149,2

We found out the next day that he has been struggling with depression and nearly followed through with a suicide attempt. Team Liquid reached out to him quickly and actively - something I think any organization should look to if anything like this happens to them.I felt it would be a good idea to share it over here because I know as a fan part of both communities, I know how vitriolic players/fans can be (especially with betting!) and how some players really take an emotional toll from this. It's not enough to just say ""deal with it"" - take responsibility for your words and understand that they have real impact. To relate it, I know that SPUNJ took a lot of flak for a recent loss, and TACO received a lot of criticism for his performance prior to a recent event. Remember that CS:GO might be extremely important to them and that their underperformance might already be taking an emotional toll on them even without the hateful comments.This should just serve as a reminder to everyone that top players are people too, and just because they might be successful or have earned a lot of prize money, it doesn't mean they aren't struggling in their own lives. It's important we show each other appreciation and make sure our criticism is constructive, not destructive.This is also a reminder to players both professional and casual that you are not alone, and that this is a community like any other.

4446,GlobalOffensive,"I've seen it at all ranks, and I just heard it in an ESEA game. ""all you can do is awp"" ""you guys are just awping us"" ""use a real gun"" etc.Instead of complaining about it, here's a few tips on how to counter a CT side awp hold. I know these might seem like common sense to a lot of people, but every time I peek an awp and die to it, I try to remember these things for the next round. Close the distanceThe AWP is meant to be a long range engage tool. Take a long range shot, and fall back to cover. It can be hard to deal with a couple of awpers on the CT side in competitive. If you can close the distance, the awper will have less cover to fall back to, allowing you to take a favorable aim duel, or allow your team to trade the kill. Use grenades effectively Learn how to smoke, flash, and molly your way to a bombsite. It's not that hard on the normal maps, and this is the best way to close distance. Plant the bomb Awp's are terrible for re-takes, as the T's can stay hidden and force the awp to fight close range. Once you've closed the distance, use positioning to your advantage to take a favorable aim duel. A couple of examples of how to close distance on an awper:Taking Long A on Dust2 Don't try to take long if the other team is on a full buy without smoking the corner. Everyone in MM with an awp will play corner, and it is very hard to trade a kill from this position. Smoking the corner is very easy to learn, and 1 smoke and flash will easily allow you to take long control. Smoke and flash the cross, and you've just earned A bombsite. Taking B on Dust2 While I recommend smoking CT and splitting into the B bombsite, if your team is focused on rushing B, throw a smoke to the front of the platform to render an AWP on platform useless. You can split up around the smoke to close the distance on him and overwhelm him. This allows the team to focus their aim at door, window, and car. Smoke doors once you take the site and window if you have another smoke. Taking A on Mirage If you're only ever going to learn to throw one smoke in CS:GO, smoking CT on Mirage is the best one you can. If you're lucky enough to get a team who can smoke CT, jungle, and stairs, you should have an easy time winning T side on Mirage. The CT smoke forces the awp playing there to jump up on ticket booth, giving your team an easy trade if he lands a shot. Jungle can be smoked once you get out of ramp, but learning that smoke is great as well. Taking B on Mirage This is a very underutilized smoke/flash combo that can have great success. Throwing a smoke at the end of apartments allows you to either jump through the smoke or jump out window without anyone at bench or van being able to see where you are going. Flashing out of window (the white smudge) will help you more easily take Catwalk control and if placed right, will blind anyone in window trying to pick you as you cross.

If the user responds to this post on his Reddit account, I will add it, but the only recognition I can currently give is his ESEA account: verizon.tl;dr warden is an idiot & piece of shit, frod is awful, orgs have too much strengthso basically if anyones been watching coL matches for the past month they'll notice a couple of things1) frod sucks ass
2) team is underperforming and losing a lot of matches because of the amount of ass he sucks + not in a good mental state because of it
3) because of frod all of the other players on the team are dramatically underperforminga lotta ppl must be wondering: why hasn't frod been removed? obviously he is nowhere close to being able to compete in professional level (or even at a premier level...), and i myself have been wondering as welli have, through my years of expertise, managed to pinpoint the problem:wardennow why this idiot is still involved in the organization who the fuck knows, but in case anyone is unfamiliar with the situaiton: he's basically the only person in the org that wants frod on the team. whether or not the players will publically support that (doubt it because of their contracts) is irrelevant but nobody wants him on the team, periodso why can't 4 players not wanting to play with someone remove them from the team? the issue is simple: the way that current na cs / turner league is structured. in case anyone is unfamiliar with THAT - the organization gets the invites, not the actual players/teams. in this case coL org has an invite which means basically, if a player wants to play in turner they either play as part of the org or they don't play at all. in the situation here, nobody wants to play with frod except warden (the fucking COACH), but because that incompetent fool has more pull in the org than the 4 other players coL will continue to lose matches and be awful until jason lake wakes up and decides to remove warden/frod from the team (which won't ever happen)so basically i made this post to help gather the community behind the 4 competent players in coL's back and to shine some light on why na competitive cs is fucked up (players have absolutely no power if theres some dipshit like warden with any say in the org).

4709,GlobalOffensive,"So I see a lot of people posting on Reddit that they are going to MLG Columbus to watch the major and then I read the recommendations of MLG about where to park and where to have lunch and what not. I find it very strange how a company that is based in NYC is giving recommendations on where to park and eat. Myself being a Columbus native and working downtown, I thought I might know way more about surviving a weekend in Columbus, so that is what I am here to help everyone with. First thing’s first, be VERY CAREFUL about where and how you say “Boys in Blue” around those who are native to Columbus that don't know much about gaming. The reason is that the rival American football team to THE Ohio State Buckeyes is still hated and even never referred to by name (we call them “the team up north”). Maze and blue are the rival team’s colors and unless you want to get lynched, I'd be careful about saying that (obviously this a joke and if you where a t-shirt with the nV phrase on it you shouldn't get any questions from any Buckeye fans).The next thing is parking. I noticed on MLG’s website is they recommended parking VERY close to the arena. However, there are much cheaper places to park around the area and don’t cost nearly as much for the whole day, but it's a little longer of a walk. NOTE: THIS IS IN A CITY, YOU WILL HAVE TO PAY FOR PARKING NO MATTER WHAT TO GET WITHIN A COUPLE BLOCKS OF THE ARENA!Below I have created a map of cheaper lots that are around the arena and recommend that if you plan on utilizing one of these lots that you get there EARLY as Columbus parking is currently a struggle. I know about these lots because I work in some of them and have had communications with owners of other lots. Also, please plan around on Friday to include RUSH HOUR into your morning schedule as I would assume there would be some people staying on the east side of Columbus in hotels and what not. Rush hour normally lasts from around 7:30-9:00. THIS IS FOR FRIDAY ONLY!!!  http://i.imgur.com/XSV7o9D.png
Red square zoomed in: http://i.imgur.com/j9QeigP.pngI would figure that many people might leave the arena in the middle of the day to get something that is cheaper and will be directed to either a fast food chain or a bar in the arena district. However, on Friday the business district restaurants will be open until about 3pm est. I would highly recommend going to the business district to eat on Friday (if you don't mind the walk). You might need to look up some places on your phone or talk to someone who has eaten at these places before and ask them their favorite (mine is Lexi’s at the bottom of the Chase Tower). I will be at the event (along with other Columbus natives) so if you have any questions about downtown Columbus, ask someone who knows the answer. I hope this helps with any potential questions people might have had about Columbus and will monitor this post to answer any follow up questions anyone may have. Edit1:So I have gone through all the recommendations for places to eat and drink within walking distance of the arena and have come to a list of places from people who are more knowledgeable than me about the bars and breweries in and near the arena district. The list will go in order of distance from the arena itself. Also, please note that if you do want a wide variety of food selection, most people are going to recommend going to the North Market to eat. I am unsure if they serve alcohol in there (I don't drink so I didn't ever bother to check when I was there) but they have some of the better food in the area and are a short walk away.Arena District/Short North:I only listed my favorite places to eat in the business district as most people who replied to this thread replied with a place in or near the arena district. I will add anymore recommendations for where people could go on Friday in the business district as needed. I go to these places most of time because they are close to where I work and have good food.Business District:Hope this helps organize all the info people were posting.

4737,GlobalOffensive,"Hi, I recently thought about how we can't view our team's available grenades mid-game and I decided to spend some time creating a couple of pictures to show how this information could be delivered to us on the scoreboard as an alternative to Kills, Assists, Deaths and MVP's. Players would be able to have more information available to them about their team's current situation in regards to weapons and grenades and can use this information in a constructive way as opposed to the non-constructive behaviour K/A/D brings.Of course this would only be an option for players, maybe done through the use of a command line or an option in the menus as to which information you wish to be displayed on the Scoreboard.Here is a picture of what it would look likeHere is a picture showing the enemy team K/A/D also being blocked as a further optionKnowing what utility is left on your team-mates mid-round is crucial in a game like CSGO and I hope this proves to be a viable option for the devs.If you like this idea then let's get this noticed now that the devs are active on Reddit! I hope this can be food for thought for them to try and get something similar developed.Edit: for those saying that this should just be added beside K/A/D, keep in mind this Scoreboard is 1920x1080 so there is a lot of space between the name column and the money column which is not as big on lower resolutions. and it begins to get cluttered in my opinion.Here is an updated version where the Weapon/Utility column is added to the existing scoreboard with no other changes.",27,https://www.reddit.com/r/GlobalOffensive/comments/48ra3p,Suggestion: Allow us to Switch between K/A/D or Weapon/Utility on the Scoreboard (with pics),i may have gotten carried away...,http://reddit.com/r/GlobalOffensive/comments/48ra3p/c/d0m17sb,751,2

Did you notice that the US Fed decision last week caused conversion rates to shoot up (as in almost 2% in a day for CADUSD)? Were you (myself included) eagerly waiting for Valve to update the rates over the last week? Well, Valve finally got the memo about the Fed decision and they went ahead and updated the currency conversion rates to bring us out of 2003.This is the item schema update in question, by the way: https://github.com/SteamDatabase/SteamTracking/commit/5069157aa1a7f6f8078791d42160cbab5c491b06.diffDota 2's item schema stores pricing info in the schema, so if currency conversion rates get updated, it can be seen.Due to the extensive nature of this particular change, here's a breakdown of what happened:Also, theoretically, if support for the Australian dollar was made available on Steam (which it was supposedly going to be but things happened), things would be a bit cheaper for them too. However they're still stuck with paying USD at the mercy of separate rates from Valve's.Usually there is a delay between rates being updated in Dota 2 and in CS:GO and other parts of Steam, as Dota 2 generally tends to get conversion rates updated first. This delay is typically a day or two, but sometimes sooner. Prepare your wallets accordingly!",24,https://www.reddit.com/r/GlobalOffensive/comments/4btz5e,"Heads up Canadians, Brits, South Africans, Russians, Brazilians, and many others: numerous currency conversion rates were FINALLY updated in a Dota 2 item schema update, expect the changes to hit CS:GO within a short while","Of course prices go up for the pound, it was already the most expensive for us...now even more so",http://reddit.com/r/GlobalOffensive/comments/4btz5e/c/d1ctrin,131,2

5539,GlobalOffensive,"Czech VOD: http://www.twitch.tv/oskartommy/v/52816562 from 02:00:40 to around 02:11:00Important things are in boldTranslation (without the gibberish around):I had two offers. Today Maikelele wrote to me about something and I thought that he wants to invite me to FaZe, but it wasn't an offer, but just some friendly chat.
I received an offer from one American team. Some team Optic. I can say this because it's not realistic for me. (Answers a question from the chat:) Why is it not realistic? Because I don't want to America, and to team Optic.. If I had an offer for example from Cloud9, I would think about moving there, but some Optic that weren't even on the qualification (he means the major qualification), I don't want that.
You can guess. You have 20 days to guess. There are the teams, you can guess (implying he will join one of the teams that will attend the Columbus major, and then reading the entire list of participants in Columbus):You can guess, huh. I mainly hope that it's going to work out (that the transfer will be successful).
I won't say anything, huh. Wait a month.
unintelligible team? Not now, huh. I got an offer, so we'll see. I have to think about it, we'll see what's going to happen. A month is a long time.
(answers question from the chat:) Aren't you happy in HellRaisers? I am, but when you receive a 10 times better offer, and you play with 10 times better players, or, not with 10 times better players, but for 5 times bigger salary, and so on... you can't not think about it, right.
You'll see. Maybe it's not even going to work out. Everyone would change his job if he received more money for it, right?
(answers a question from the chat:) Won't be those Ukrainians again? I can't reply to this, guys. It would give you a clue.
(Afterwards, he says in a joking tone:) They are Ukrainians, heh.
You can guess, huh. You've got a month to guess.
(Answers a question from the chat:) But it is a team that is qualified for Columbus? Yes. Yes. That's enough. End of debate.EDIT: At 02:16:35, he also adds this:
(answers a question from the chat:) And you have to accept it before Columbus or after Columbus? After Columbus. There is no chance that I'm getting my own sticker now, so after Columbus.
(answers a question from the chat:) Did only you receive the offer, or did Styko/Zero also receive it? Only me.
(answers a question from the chat:) Why won't you tell us? Because it's not 100%. And I don't want to jinx it.EDIT2: At 02:21:30, he mentions this, which is another clue:
(answers a question from the chat:) Are the players from the team you are joining playing FPL? Yes, they are.EDIT3: @ 02:22:10
(answers a question from the chat:) Is anyone from the team you are joining playing with you right now? No. (there are people from Gambit and Vexed playing with him)EDIT4: @ 02:26:50 ABOUT KUCHER:
(answers a question from the chat:) When will Kucher leave HR? Kucher was probably already kicked...
and the morale (mood) in the team simply sucks...END OF TRANSLATION, CONCLUSION:Alright, so we know that he received two offers, from Optic and from another team that's attending Columbus. He turned down the Optic offer, because he doesn't want to move to USA because of Optic. He didn't receive a FaZe offer, but he recently tweeted ""FaZe Up"". It turns out that his account was hacked (???) and the ""Faze Up"" tweet was deleted.So he will join one of the teams attending Columbus, and we know that it isn't FaZe. My guess is that it's going to be one of those teams:Also, take in consideration that (AFAIK) Oskar knows only Czech and English (I'm not sure though, he may also know German), so I doubt that he will join teams like EnVyUs, where French is a need. ALSO THIS TRANSFER IS NOT 100% CONFIRMED, IT ISN'T SURE THAT HE WILL LEAVE HELLRAISERS. WE'LL FIND OUT IN 20 DAYSJust think about teams that will attend Columbus and need a solid AWPerEDIT4: considering all your comments (VP may change their roster after a huge slump, mouz's manager said that they won't change the roster, FaZe speak English...), I came to the conclusion that it's going to be either Flipside, VP, FaZe (even though oskar said that he didn't get an offer from them), Na'Vi and maybe NiP/mouz.",38,https://www.reddit.com/r/GlobalOffensive/comments/49cacw,"Oskar to leave HellRaisers ""confirmed"" on stream - ENGLISH TRANSLATION (including teams he may join)","What team thinks about changing players before a major and already makes offers?

5594,GlobalOffensive,"MLG Columbus 2016: A Valve funded CS:GO major tournament is right around the corner and as fans we can participate in the major HYPE by playing a couple of mini games on the game client itself.These two games areFantasy TeamTeam Pick'EmYou will need stickers to play these two games. You can obtain stickers from the in-game client offers section or from Get Tournament Stickers option in the WATCH tab. The player signature stickers are obtained from sticker packs for each team. Once you buy the pack and unpack it a random player signature will be given for your inventory. You can also buy team sticker and player signature foil/holo sticker packs. You can directly buy a particular team's or player's sticker directly from the steam community market. Alternatively, when you try to make a pick for a team or a player the game will pop up a buy menu from where you can buy the stickers from in game or from the market. You can apply regular stickers as well as foil/holo stickers for both these games. Once you apply the sticker it is locked until the duration of the day but it is not destroyed once you use it or even if you lose. The sticker will be available in your inventory to use again for a different day or to apply on a gun later on. 50% of the proceeds from the stickers go to players and organizations.For Fantasy Team the objective is to choose five players in five different roles that will earn you maximum points. The five roles and their respective point allocation is as follows:Once you choose 5 players and apply their stickers you have to submit the fantasy team. You can change your roster until the matches for the day begin. After that you will not be able to make any changes until the games for that day are finished. The roster will automatically roll on for the next day unless you change the players. At the end of 5 days all your points will be added up and you will earn a bronze, silver or a gold Fantasy Team Trophy depending on your ranking in the top 30%, top 15% or top 5% respectively.The objective for playing Team Pick'Em is to predict which teams will win the match-ups at different stages of the tournament. By picking correct teams on each day you will earn points that add up at the end of games for each day. The number of picks you can make and the number of points you can earn per day is as follows:*Note that the schedule for Day 4 has 3 quarterfinals and Day 5 has the last quarterfinal and the 2 semifinals. But the table above is made according to the stages of the tournaments and the points they award.Additionally you get 1 bonus point each day for just picking a team for that particular day. So there are a total of 100 points that you can earn. At the end of 5 days you will earn a bronze, silver or a gold Team Pick'Em Trophy if you score 25, 50 and 75 points and above respectively.Now that you know how to play these games and how the scoring system works, you can discuss what would be the wise choices to pick teams and players suitable for particular roles!

5650,GlobalOffensive,"Hi fellow gamers,Right now I'm writing my master thesis in game design. I am studying the toxicity in CS:GO and if there are any game mechanics that generate this toxic behaviour and what Valve could do to minimize (or eliminate) this behaviour.One part of the thesis is to examine and compare high level play (supreme and global) to low level play (Silver Elite Master and lower) to see if there are any changes in toxicity and if the reason for toxicity are different at different ranks.I would be super happy if anyone in the silver ranks would like to participate in my study. If so, what I would like is that you record your next X number of games (I need a total of 25-30 games, so depending on how many volunteers I get, the amount I need from you it will vary). Assuming that the level of toxicity is lower when playing with your own friends it would be preferable if these games are solo games.Details:Due to limiting the study and eliminating too much cultural differences I've decided that I will only pick participants from the EU region.And mentioned above I will need you to play solo games for this study.Try to be as neutral as possible in your games. Try to influence your teammates mood as little as possible. This means that you should try to not make your teammates either very happy or very angry. The more games you play the better my study will be so I am very thankful if you can send me at least 5 games. But if you want to send me 5+ games I would be even happier.You own voice chat is not recorded in a regular demo so you need to add the command ""Voice_loopback 1"" in the console before starting the recording.To start a recording simply add ""record [nickname_gamenumber]"" in the console. For instance my 3rd game would look like this: ""record BoCCAn_3""For your convenience I've opened both a dropbox folder and a google drive folder for you to drop off you completed recording, just pick one of them (I hope I got them both to work, I'm not used to use dropbox). The recordings will end up in the ""csgo""-folder with the name of the recordning. (This is the regular path: C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Counter-Strike Global Offensive\csgo)Dropbox - Link to dropbox folderGoogle Drive - Link to Google drive folderOf Course you guys will be totally anonymous in the study and I will only see your ingame nickname. If you guys have any questions about anything you can just write me a PM, or write in this thread. Or send me an email to Christian.enfors@gmail.comHopefully I've covered everything that we need to know here, and that the dropbox/drive-folders work.Let the fragging begin!EDIT:Just a clarification on the ""Try not to influence your teammates too much"". To be neutral doesn't mean that you are silent the whole game. It just means that you should not try to have an extreme impact on the mood of the server.Or as /u/-0Guppy0- points out:That's a whole part of why he is writing the thesis though. You just can't say purposefully encouraging or negative things in chat, or intentionally throw. Just play the best game you can, and call out just the facts and you will do basically net neutral impact to the overall mood of the server. Others will have to do that. Even if you're having a bad game, as long as you aren't doing it on purpose, and you're calling out the facts, it's the other people in the server that have to take action to call out your performance, and respond in a negative way to your neutral actions. Those responses to your neutral actions are what the OP is after. Just because someone responds a certain way, doesn't mean you actually caused the response. But calling someone names, or trying your best to encourage others is actively trying to degenerate or improve the overall mood and atmosphere of the server.",61,https://www.reddit.com/r/GlobalOffensive/comments/49cn4x,Looking for Silver Players for my master thesis.,Just do callouts.

5767,GlobalOffensive,"There's an issue that's been occurring pretty much since the game came out, and I've noticed it a lot, especially during streams, which is that people don't realize that their teammates dropped them a primary weapon at the start of a round.I remember a couple years back, this subreddit proposed that player's weapons are visible over their heads during freeze time (can someone find the link?) and valve responded, so hopefully they'll respond to this.One solution I can think of, which I mentioned in the title, is to make the player auto switch to a primary (cl_autowepswitch) during freeze time, and when freeze time finishes, let cl_autowepswitch work as the user previously set it. This way, if the user is not paying attention to the screen, the next time he does, he'll see his primary equipped, if a teammate dropped him.Would like to hear other ideas too.edit:people suggesting we get cl_autowepswitch 2 which does what I mentioned but gives people the option to not have it.edit2:i mentioned another idea hereedit3:i'm surprised by how many mixed responses this got (in a good way). yes, this problem could be solved by people paying attention, but it still happens, even with the HUD notifications and teammates telling them on the mic that they dropped them, so there's obviously something else going on causing people to be distracted.edit4:people keep mentioning that only dumb people need this. please understand this issue affects dumb people, smart people, and everyone in between. it's not about being dumb that makes you not realize that you have a primary; it's about being distracted, or the possibility that it may not always cross your mind to check what weapons you have at the start of a round, like if you alt-tabbed out and back into the game.i've seen plenty of PRO streamers (steel, m0e, flom, summit) have this happen to them from time to time.edit5:so lots of people are suggesting that players just 'communicate more'.
as i mentioned in the post, valve implemented the feature of drawing each player's items over their heads during freeze after seeing a post on this sub. now, that feature wouldn't have been necessary if people just communicated more, so why did valve bother making it? because communication isn't always perfect. not everyone has a microphone, not everyone has headphones and even though someone gets told over and over that they got a drop, it doesn't always make it through.",34,https://www.reddit.com/r/GlobalOffensive/comments/48it2b,[FEATURE REQUEST] Make cl_autowepswitch true during freeze time so that it's easier for players to notice if their teammates dropped them a weapon,Not if someone is afk or not paying attention.

5808,GlobalOffensive,"So I just came back from Spodek. I live in Katowice and work on Fridays so I was't planning to go today but after I saw a post on this subreddit about polish fans leaving the venue me and my friends decided it's unacceptable (and a great opportunity to go inside without long queues) and went to Spodek. It was around 10 pm local time.  When we reached Spodek the guards told us no one can enter it as it was locked since 9 pm. Yes, a major sports event was closed for everyone (except those with some kind of VIP passes) before the last semi-finals even started. Least to say we (and a few more fans who tried to get inside) were pissed.  By ways I do not want to describe (as it involved getting past guards exploiting security weaknesses, more on this later) we managed to get inside. Place was dead, except for the main floor where some fans were still present. Now we come to the next atrocity. The event went on for too long. I know most fans left after VP lost but almost none remained for the last round of Fnatic vs Astralis (it was around 3 am when it started). Not many people can last this long. I'm most astonished the players managed to play so good at so late hour. So at this time even the biggest fans of CS GO left. Not more than 30 people remained for the last round. To add to this at some point around 1 am they turned down (or even off) heating. It got cold pretty fast.   When we left Spodek we noticed something strange. There was no security anywhere. Anyone could go in, leave, move around, maybe even go backstage. Needless to say in this day and age such security flaws are a very worrying thing. Not to mention one could easily go in, steal some computers or chairs and leave without being bothered. I guess the guards ended their workday at around 12 am/ 1 am and pretty much no one was left. We might have laughed at it but it was surely just adding to the weirdness of this whole event. Someone fucked up pretty badly organizing it.

6013,GlobalOffensive,"Hi everyone, today we’d like to announce some updates and changes coming to FACEIT for CS:GO players. SOLO/DUO RANKED LEAGUE and QUEUETomorrow with the beginning of the new season, a new league system will be added for EU and NA players. The current 5v5 Leagues and 5v5 queue system will remain the same as it is today. Players will still be able to play solo or in a full team, collecting points towards the 5v5 Leagues.A new Solo/Duo League and Solo/Duo queue will be added where points can be won and lost only by players playing in the Solo/Duo queue. Premium players can only join the Solo/Duo queue when playing alone or with one other friend. We will be removing the Premium Queue option once the Solo/Duo Queue goes live. Players with any subscription (unlimited or premium) will be able to compete in the Solo/Duo League.This new League will also serve as the place where players will be able to qualify into the FPL.  VOTE KICK SYSTEMIn the SOLO/DUO queue we will be activating a new feature that will allow you to kick a player from the server if 4 members of the team have agreed on that. Every player will be able to call a Vote Kick once per match. If a player has left the game, then the required votes will be reduced to 3 players in order to kick a player. TIMEOUTSWe will be enabling the Timeout system implemented by Valve. Each team will be able to call a 60 second timeout, once per match. ELO RESET We are removing the Elo reset that happens at the start of the month for all players except the highest and lowest elo ranges. Only players above 2100 and below 700 will be reset to 2100 and 700 respectively. SERVER ISSUESServer issues are always a hot topic and we are constantly working on improving their stability as well as performance. We have implemented a new tracking system on all our servers which will monitor any fluctuations in performance and allow us to identify and fix issues faster and we are testing two new providers for both EU and NA in order to get better routing for certain locations. FPL QUALIFIERTo the select few who enter into the FPL qualifiers, we have decided to change the format and schedule. From now on, FPL qualifiers will be held on a weekend and only open for a specific time period on those days. This decision was made based on feedback from players, where commitments during the week left them unable to fully commit to qualification (School, work etc). The next FPL qualifier will take place on Saturday 9th and Sunday 10th April from 10am CEST/CDT until 2am CEST/CDT CLOSING OF THE OLD WEB APPLICATIONAnd Finally, after many years of service we will be closing the old FACEIT site for good. From now on, what was beta.faceit.com will now be accessible through www.faceit.com and you will no longer be able to access the old website.   TL;DR: EDIT: The Vote Kicking functionality will be enabled for the Solo/Duo queue between tonight and tomorrow afternoon.",79,https://www.reddit.com/r/GlobalOffensive/comments/4cql9i,FACEIT Platform Updates.,"The elo reset decision is the best IMO, it was getting really old actually.

6088,GlobalOffensive,"New to Reddit, hi, hello!I see a lot of misconceptions when it comes to bunny hopping. Often people are accused of scripting for just being good at it. I'd like to clear some of the gray areas up.As someone who has been b-hopping around 5 hours a day for the last 6 months, and just b-hopping, I find myself SOMEWHAT qualified to post this. Feel free to disagree. I play MM and like to b-hop quite a lot, as it's fun and I don't take the game too seriously when it comes to the wins or losses. So, into the ""meat"" of this. Many people see someone not strafing and immediately think scripting. If you are on a flat surface, this is easy. To test, if you run with your knife out and jump, and jump, and jump, just like bunny hopping, but without strafing, you can maintain a 250 velocity, fairly easily (with practice) by just using a scroll wheel! No hands on the keyboard after the first jump. People who consider themselves great at bunny hopping can always find someone better them. There is no ""best"" b-hopper, as everyone is always improving! You may have b-hopped since 1.6, and someone who just started a couple months ago can be better than you. It's about practice and putting in the time. Maps like Nuke and Cache are VERY flat. If you're new to bunny hopping, practice on these maps. It will help out so much. Cache T spawn to B site is quite possibly my favorite place to bunny hop. Mirage is another good map, as it's very flat on the A site ""half"" of the map. When considering if someone is scripting, think if it's a flat map, or flat area even. They will pull off b-hops here much easier than let's say something like an A Long on Dust II.With enough map knowledge (not strategical knowledge, but polygons-on-the-ground knowledge) anyone can b-hop on any surface, and on any map, and with ease. This is a major one I see all the time. Team mates on your team, or viewers of a stream (whatever the case may be), often accuse people of scripting just because they have a gun out. You can still strafe, still gain velocity, still jump with a gun out. If you start with your knife, are at 260+ velocity, and switch to your primary, you will not lose speed if you continue to hit the bunny hops properly. This is a great way to surprise people. (Note: You can start with a gun out, but it is a bit more difficult to start b-hopping, but still very well possible). 64 tick with a locked frame rate (30, 45, 60, 90, 100, 120, 144, etc. [depending on your PC's specs]) can become so easy to b-hop on. Personally, I lock my frame rate at 200, as I get well above 200 FPS on every map. This is just for consistency with your bunny-hopping. If you don't like capping your frame rate, feel free to ignore this!I hope I cleared up some stuff for people, and PLEASE do not accuse someone of scripting just because they b-hop well. Overwatch has an option for ""automated jump scripts."" Something like this is impossible to see and be certain about. Some people just have a lot of practice. Sure, some people script, but it will be impossible to determine if it's a script until Valve steps up their anti-cheat or has some sort of input detection to truly determine it. If an input is giving 1,000 jumps a second, probably a script (I know nothing about scripting or if 1,000 jumps a second would even read on the game's engine, please forgive me, coders/scripters/knowledgeable people, if that number is too high or too low). Sorry for the rant (especially at the end there about OW), but I hope it cleared up some stuff. If this was too much to read, the bullet points should get the basis of the information covered.

I know what you're thinking, ""Vinck! throwing something off the court isn't a dunk!"". I know. We all know. Let's move past it.

Check the sticky comment below to vote./u/Davjo with the 'Why not use weapons to dunk for once?'We first have to appreciate the colour scheming that goes on. There's aqua blue all throughout and we are clearly dealing with a professional. There's 1211 confirmed kills on that scout and that technique shines through with the lay-up noscope./u/ORGANICFORKS brings us  'My Submission'It's a smooth move, no one can deny that. Clear signs of the graft and work that have gone into it displayed all over the court. It takes you one way, it takes you another way, he releases the decoy and what happens next? Will shock you./u/rubenoriginal delivers 'Backwards runboost shot'It's the ronseal of the bunch. We've got here multiple angles, in slow mo, tracking to fully display the tekkers. The underhand little toss as he turns 180 to watch it glide in is understated and sublime. His mate, so excited to pull off the move, explodes halfway through the clip./u/sackboy_andy presents 'Here's my submission'There's a lot of disciplines going on here. We have some topspin, a grenade assist, a bit of route one and finally some tapping to fade it in.

You've got a day for the polling to be open before we announce a winner and IEM Katowice starts so we have to not take up front page space. And in all seriousness; things like this can be fun and we want to encourage it. However, we have to balance when things get out of control and how much we have to moderate.

The topic for the Master Thesis is specifically on how brands are effected by communities and attending eSport events.

What makes eSports special is the opportunity for anyone and everyone to have an opportunity to be involved within an organization, to compete for a championship, or to just enjoy witnessing the birth of a new industry.Disclaimer: This isn’t trying to promote anything or anyone in a positive or negative light, it is purely a story about how grinding hard, having a dream, and remaining persistent can pay off.  I also totally understand this is really long and not for everyone, but it was something important to me and I hope a few of you find it entertaining.Hi My Name is Finch
Let's start with me, just so you can get a better understanding why I think this is a crazy story and a story worth telling.  I currently work as a behavior analyst and as a therapist at a inpatient drug rehabilitation program.  I am not some eSport veteran or some fancy investor with a big background in business.  Back in 2013, I was doing a podcast called Dota Insight and one day this guy named Frost hit me up and essentially said, “Hey, you are a good looking dude.  We are running a LAN, would you be interested in hosting it?”  Shortly after Frost decided to start F3 with the idea of creating a player first organization, he wanted me to be a part of it and I couldn’t say no (especially after he said I was good looking).  At this time, we were just a group of people wanting to create something in eSports so we set out to do the best we could do.  Nearly 3 years later I am still here and get to have my hands in many aspects within F3.  For our first year we were pretty much 100% focused on Dota 2 as we had a solid Dota squad being led by Mania and I was doing more Dota specific content to help build our brand.  (There are plenty of crazy Dota stories, but I will share those later if I am able to write a “Tell All” book)Despite my job and grad school, F3 was more of a dream of something we could potentially build someday.  I have had many friends and family over the years tell me that it is a waste of time, that video games are a waste of time, and that I just need to stop doing any F3 related activities.  There were times when things looked like we had no more fuel left in the tank to keep things moving, but somehow we are still here and still fighting.  To all those people who told me those things, you should watch MLG Columbus and watch the world's best Counter Strike players compete at the highest level for $1,000,000.  One of the few things that kept us going was each other.  I know there were times that Frost, wuvs, and I were all down...but somehow we kept one another inspired.  Without Frost or wuvs, I would have left eSports years ago and I am lucky to call them my friends and extended family.F3’s Entry into CSGO
In 2014, I started to really pay attention to CSGO and interested in its potential to grow.  Personally I never played a Counter Strike game in my life, but I did enjoy watching CSGO.  At the end of 2013, we lost our Dota team to a big investor promising to sink $200,000 into the squad and they became Team Sigma (Spoiler alert, they never got paid).  This was my first lesson in eSports, “It is a shitty business filled with shitty people, disappointments happen and you have to take a punch sometimes.”  Lesson two was, ‘When things are too good to be true, they are too good to be true.”   It was near the end of 2013 and we had no Dota team and a sponsor who didn’t want to remain in Dota.  After a while Frost finally listened to me and let me begin our CSGO expansion project.  We had no experience in CS, so I made this Reddit post From that post I got at least 30 applications.  I conducted interviews and narrowed it down to a few people.  We started a CS show called The CS Academy with Foritzio and then Mats helped me scout potential rosters.  We ended up speaking with Hydrox and loving his personality, so we decided to pick up Highgrade at the end of March 2014 (2 years later to the date we will be playing in a $1,000,000 tournament...crazy.)  The roster was Hydrox, relik, zape, windster, and barsiC.  After a few months Jumpy joined and replaced windster.  We competed in the lower ESEA divisions and any open bracket tournament we could to work our way up the ladder.The Swedes
Our main goal with this roster was to attend Dreamhack Summer 2014 in which we hoped to battle through the open bracket.   At the event we did just that, we made it out of the open bracket and into groups.  That alone made us satisfied, but in our group match we took down NaVi...THE NaVi.  We won 16-14 on Dust 2 (watch the end, Zape with the clutch still gives me chills)  I was at my Grandfather's house for a 4th of July BBQ and watching this on my phone, literally losing my shit and no one there understood why.  Ultimately we ended up dropping our next sets to Lemondogs and NaVi and finished 3rd in the group, but we still were ecstatic.  Our sponsor was so excited he wanted to give the team a new salary and a long term contract.  “This was it, we made it, we are on the fast track to success” is what I thought.  Not so fast, after the event we learn that Jumpy has received offers from big teams after his great DH performance and was leaving.  Our sponsor would only sponsor the whole team and Jumpy just jumped out, so we were back to square one.After Jumpy left, the guys never were able to find a strong 5th so we began to look for our next move.  We learned that Schneider was a free agent after his stint on Fnatic and was looking for a new organization.  After some talks with him, we felt like the roster he was putting together would be great.  So we hit the sponsorship hunt hard and got them their money.  The squad was Schneider, Moddii, cENTRYZ, Pyth, and Twist.The guys are all funny and lighthearted, the team chat was great.  We all thought they would be able to really hit the ground hard and put up some good results.  But as I said earlier, when things are too good to be true...there is a really good chance they are too good to be true.  After a few weeks, Schneider approached us and said something along the lines of “things are not working out, we are having a ton of disagreements, we need to make some roster changes to fill the support role.” Discussions were had with the players, and honestly we didn’t resist as much as we should have because we wanted to keep our players happy, and eventually (to my great disappointment that we didn’t get to work with him long term, because Pyth was an awesome dude) we release Pyth and bring in Spitfire.  So roster swap is made, so things are good now right?….NOPE.  Shortly after the change, Moddii makes a post on his Facebook saying he is leaving the team.  This is without consulting us so we were pretty much in the dark.  (I was at work at this time and got a call from one of our sponsors asking what was up with the roster.  Let me tell you, THAT was an awkard discussion when I had no clue what happened…).  We investigate, obviously, and find out that there were still major roster disagreements so we ultimately decided to part ways.  The next domino to fall was Twist also wanting to leave, so the roster basically imploded.  This time our sponsor is done, they dislike the inconsistency of rosters in CS:GO and do not see how they can get marketability when players keep coming and going.  What we thought was such a sure bet for success blew up in our face.  This caused people to walk away from the organization, staff to be discouraged, and the future of F3 to be uncertain.Swedes 3.0?
In September 2014 we get another chance to take a stab at another team, this time Twist approached us about his new squad wanting funding to get to GIGACON. They win the whole damn event and end up wanting to stick together longer and remain under our tag.  The roster is Twist, Berg, Dumas, Bendji, and Robiin.In November 2014, we were part of a charity event called Gamers Impact.  Part of this was us hosting a tournament and running giveaways / production on the event.  At the time, the funding source said we were not allowed to have the F3 CSGO team play in the tournament, so we had to find other teams. This made me FURIOUS and know I complained a ton about it at the time.  Yet, ironically enough, this is the first time that we met B1ad3 since dAT Team took part in the event.Dreamhack Winter 2014 Qualifier time comes around, and we’re pretty hopeful that we can make it through.  Less than 48 hour from the start of the qualifier we learn Robiin can not play in the qualifier...BOOM panic sets in.  The guys scramble and decide Zende will have to be the stand in. We fall short in the qualifier, the dream is over. The squad decides that it is time to call it quits since there are not any more majors in 2014 coming up.  BUT WAIT, a miraculous 2nd chance emerges.  Kqly gets a VAC ban and Titan is disqualified for the DH Winter 2014 major.  We then get a slot in the Last Call qualifier  and get matched up against the solid London Conspiracy lineup... and just play fantastic. “We did it, we are in the dance. Surely this will be our time to shine.” At Dreamhack Winter 2014 Twist and crew continue their form and show some great play at the event. Once again we run into NaVi in our first CSGO Major and take them to the brink. We have a 15-14 lead and NaVi is on a CZ buy. “This is it...we finally have gotten lucky, we are going to get Top 8, get the guaranteed sticker money, land new sponsors, and move on in the world!” we choke to the eco and go on to lose in overtime.The event ends, we think we will be solid for the future but once again roster issues plague us. Twist, Zende, and Berg are certain it was time to part with Bendji and Dumas to instead bring in Schneider and Pauf. We feel like this roster can really do things so we make the call and we begin to prepare for 2015.  We line up two new sponsors who want to support this team, and are all set to move forward with the updated contracts for the existing 3 players with extended terms as well as new contracts for the 2 new players to match.  We then find out through some outside sources that this new team has no intention to resign with us at all, but rather are in talks several other organizations through the two not yet signed players. This was confirmed when they guys let us know they were leaving for Team Property when their contracts with us expired.  Once again, team is gone, the two new sponsors walk because we don't have that team. The well might have dried up for the last time. After nearly a year's worth of rosters coming and going, people are discouraged and disappointed once again.  Whenever we feel like we are on the cusp, something out of our control happens and the whole house of cards comes toppling down.A New Hope
At this point it is January 2015, we have begun to search other permanent solutions.  There was this mad grab from organizations to lock up rosters at this time, this was when big brands such as TSM got involved in the scene and the more established “proven” rosters were all being scooped up.  It was at that time we reconnected with B1ad3 and learn they were searching for an organization. We really enjoyed working with  daT team during the Gamers Impact tournament, so we continued to figure out what we could do to make it work.  In what seemed to be a match made in heaven, they agreed to take a chance on an NA org they didn’t know much about, and we agreed to take a chance on a new region and a new roster as they had just swapped out adreN and flamie for Markeloff and s1mple.  Things worked out and we announced the roster on February 1st 2015.At this point, I assume that most people began to recognize our name and see us more in the public eye. I'll write the whole story about the 2015 year when I decide to write the whole book one day. But TL;DR 2015 was a hell of a great year for us and the guys.  We qualified for EVERY CSGO Major, despite having really a roster of 4 people, with a 5th slot that was being switched back and forth between 2 players because of tournament restrictions on s1mple.  We got to compete in the first ever ESL Pro League and other major international events who had record breaking prize pools.  Most importantly, we got to build relationships with people all over the world and have been on this miraculous journey to a $1,000,000 CSGO event.  Blad3, Bondik, WorldEdit, and Markeloff have remained such a strong stable core through all of 2015.  Most importantly, they were just good solid dudes that we are insanely lucky to be able to call apart of the F3 family.Hey Finch...Wrap it Up….
    What this story doesn’t do well to highlight is the amount of hours that go into a project such as this and how crazy talented some people are.  Part of our philosophy of being a player first organization is that this whole machine thrives on people who are dedicated to helping us achieve the next level.  Sure there have been sleepless nights and terrible days, but there have also been triumphs.  The fact that after nearly 3 years of keeping this weird machine called Flipsid3 Tactics moving forward, we are now going to be in our home country at a $1,000,000 tournament at MLG.  This alone makes it all the struggles and disarray worth it.  (Fun fact most people don’t know, we are a North American organization with a large chunk of our staff living in North America)Every time something went wrong in these past 3 years with a roster, a sponsor, unanticipated expenses that were over our budget, or being told we were told we are too small and never will amount to anything, it all hit us right in the gut.  It all hurt and caused us to second guess this project we have sunk countless hours into day in and day out.  But somehow we persevered and found a way forward.  If Hydrox told me no, we don’t get to compete in DH Summer and no one sees our brand and established CSGO players are hesitant to take a chance on some small organization.  If we had our own CSGO team play in our tournament, we would never have met B1ad3 and daT team.  If not for our former roster choosing to leave for an organization closer to home, we would never have had the chance at this new roster taking a gamble on us, an NA org far away from their home, and blessing us with the best year of F3s lifetime.  The most important thing you can do when you run into a road block, is to find away around that roadblock without feeling sorry for yourself.Thank you to Frost for roping me into this crazy world and being a stubborn but persistent visionary.  Thank you to wuvs for being the momager that we all needed and for always finding a way forward when things look bleakest.  Thank you to B1ad3, Markeloff, WorldEdit, Bondik, and S1mple, for giving a NA organization a chance and sending us on this awesome journey and for continuing to work hard every single day.  Thank you DavCost and Shara for showing up every day and giving it your all even when you weren’t sure if you would officially become F3.  Thank you to Foritizio and Mats on trusting some dude on Reddit to start a CSGO division.  Thank you to Hydrox for helping open the door for us within CSGO and proving that open brackets have a place in major tournaments.  Thank you to the rest of F3 who are too many to mention here for your tireless work in building what we have built; the staff, designers, players, managers, volunteers, and everyone across all of our divisions.  Thank you to our sponsors, past and present, we would not be here without the support you guys have given us.  Lastly, thank you to any of our fans who have supported F3 at any point in our 3 years, it truly means a lot.  If there is anything that you can take away from my story, please understand that life can be rough, difficult, and at times seem like you are out of options to continue forward.  However, with the belief in yourself and the persistence to grind away day in and day out regardless of results, you CAN achieve your goals and aspirations.If you have any questions for me about F3, about eSports, or anything on your mind, drop them in here or hit me up on Twitter.  I'll do my best to answer all of them.  If you are going to MLG Columbus, look for me there and let's grab a beer, I would love to hear your eSports story.",31,https://www.reddit.com/r/GlobalOffensive/comments/4b7wop,"Flipsid3, The Journey from Nothing to a $1,000,000 CSGO Major",sorry (hi for bad english),http://reddit.com/r/GlobalOffensive/comments/4b7wop/c/d16tjqh,1349,2
6881,GlobalOffensive,"Hi Reddit. I'm old. I'm not really old in the sense of the world. I'm only 30. But here... and in games like CS:GO, I find myself to be too old to 'kick it', so to speak. There once was a time when I belonged here. I used to post pictures of Rick Astley on 4chan, and troll soccer mom forums yelling things about pools being closed. I even used to fit in here, being a college-aged computer science nerd with way too much time to browse the internet. .These times, though, are over for me now. I have a wife. I have a job where I actually do really important stuff. I still love to fuck around and troll and make jokes, but I can't say I'm a part of this new culture. I never got into youtube, or twitch. I only subscribe to a few subreddits, so hearing about which memes are dankest is something I could care less about. I don't bind text phrases to my keys and spam them, or throw smokes on the ground while defusing even though everyone is dead, because I just don't get it..At first, I was mad. Mad that my games were filled with shitty, immature kids who were practically indistinguishable from each other. Mad that every game was nothing but trolling, screaming, and dick waving, right up to the very end. But I'm not mad anymore. I get it. You guys are young, you're having fun playing your favorite game, you're fucking around with your friends and trying to make each other laugh. I was there once. I'm sure I made just as many awful jokes that people had heard before..I'm not asking you to stop, because that's not a fight that I - or anyone - can win. The game, and the internet, is what it is. All I'm asking for now is this: Where can I find others like me? Did all the other people grow up and stop playing games? Am I getting too old to play this? Or is there still a spot for me, somewhere?",23,https://www.reddit.com/r/GlobalOffensive/comments/4963c5,CS:GO - No older people allowed.,"There are at least dozens of us, dozens!",http://reddit.com/r/GlobalOffensive/comments/4963c5/c/d0peq58,142,5

6920,GlobalOffensive,"I was a content creator for AGG. I made a few videos for them but ultimately stopped working for them because of complications.Now I wanna tell you this right now. The owner works fast, he got himself so many teams and probably worked himself into a pay rut. With so many teams to pay it probably got to him.So what was wrong?When working with AGG the owner was a bit unprofessional. I don't like to bash others but the experience I had with this organization was a little too hard to experience.The owner expected a video every week basically rushing me.I'm a content creator but I make frag movies stuff like Tweeday and Silent I don't make easy stuff that can be produced in a week. It usually takes me a few weeks to get a good video out.If a pro team org can't release a frag video on a team every week then I can't. I'm not as good as other content creators. There are people better than me. But if Cloud9 can't make a video based on their team's games I can't do it either.That's because they have school! They have other things to do too!Yeah? I do too. I'm only 17 and am in the CISCO network program. That's an honors program that takes quite a bit of my time. Coming out with content and handing a class that takes half of a school day plus the homework I get is massive. It's a miracle for me to release a video every week without worrying about my education.If you couldn't do it then why apply in the first place?The org was a small org, they weren't that big. They had Ocean and he's pretty big but nether the less it was a small organization. I had expected it to be simple but realizing that I was the only content creator besides the owner pumping videos I couldn't do it by myself. I took the opportunity to get better at content creating. I wanted to expand a portfolio just in case I wanted a job like this again.Why make this post?I wanted to tell people that my experience with AGG was unprofessional and to look out just in case you were thinking of going with this organization.If you have a question post it I'll try to respond.EDIT: okay let me go into detail: I spent 30 minutes a day on those videos multiply that by 7 divide by 60 that's how many hours I spent on 1 video. I was rushing and not focusing on a few things to get it done.Never said it was illegal for me to work I'm just not allowed by the Social Security to work because my family is poor. If I work I lose as much as I made from the check and we don't wanna risk losing it completely.EDIT2: I am not trash talking AGG at all I found how they deal with situations other pro orgs would easily solve as poorly handled.EDIT 3: For the people who don't get it. He wanted a video on his channel a few vids a week. I was the only content creator. What could he have done to get his goal? Get more content creators. I was only a free worker and he basically expected me to do it by myself. It's not my fault that ""I didn't know what I was getting myself into"" Because I did. I knew what was to expect from. I just expected him to get more content creators so it's not all on 1 person. Go to Cloud9's Youtube Channel. You will see little to no frag movies a month. If those companies couldn't do it then I can't even do it. I even explained this to him and he still wanted a video a week. What did he do when he realized I couldn't do it? Nothing.

This system is used in rocket league i believe, where everyone gets re placed into new ranks.  What this system will do is:Allow players to get placed where they belong, either lower or higher.The upper level of the player base will be more populated if people have to KEEP TRYING to get globalELO shifts (Like the one in the rank changes months ago) could be made during the beginning of a new season, so people dont massively derankAgain, because of the vac bans months ago, the ranks were inflated and the upper part of the player base was highly occupied.  Valve could have, if they were using the season system, just changed the elo settings during the transition to the next season.Maybe the time for a season shouldnt be one year, maybe 6 months, or even 3.  But I think implementing seasons into csgo ranking system would be a great ideaTL;DR
Reseting CS:GO's ranks every few months and having people get re placed will keep the player base wanting to play and get global again and will put people at the rank they deserve, allowing for fair play.

Most of them moved to CS:GO and I was one of those fools who resisted change and was never really into pro-mod or global offensive or any of the newer mod's. I never played counter-strike after that and moved on a lot of mmorpg's until now.So my friend gifted me a copy of the game last week and I said fuck it and started playing. Man o man, is the game different now or what? I still have a lot of things counter-strike in my muscle memory and I was expecting to be really good right from the get-go. But I got crushed. The recoil is different. The spray patterns are different. The cross-hair is different and so many new guns. This was really disheartening in the beginning but I wanted to get better at the game.

7314,GlobalOffensive,"Let's keep it simple: there's one thing you can do straight away as an individual or a team to win more important rounds - and more matches. Play smarter! A lot of Lem-ge players play totally braindead. There is no need - 4 simple gameplay behaviours, 2 as t, 2 as ct, will help you improve.1.) When the bomb is down as T side, if the CTs have more players than you: I.e 4v2, you should be aggressive.Don't be predictable, but you need to force aim duels and level the teams out fast. Catch rotators, peek their likely routes. if they have more players to retake, being too passive often allows them to use their advantage with ease: they will clear the site down slowly and trade you more often than not, unless you go huge.You don't need to wreck the whole team, just by taking one or two down you can retreat and revert to a passive style, suddenly completely in control: see the next tip.Don't be that team that gives up the round free by sitting in sandwich and firebox/ninja waiting for them to do what they want, hoping that for some impossible reason they won't find you. 2.) With the bomb down as T side, if you have equal or more players than the other team you should often play very passively to best utilise your advantage, staying alive and setting up crossfires. You don't have to fight them and they can't easily trade you down.Take note of where the bomb is, it is critical when passive that you can get clear line of sight to the plant. E.g mirage a site: if bomb is planted outside firebox you shouldn't play Tetris or ramp: palace or ct will be best. Give them nothing, make them move into exposed positions to try and flush you out, then let your teammate catch them with a crossfire. Make them work for every kill, draining the clock down. Don't be that team that loses the 4v2 by all pushing out and giving them free targets to aim at. 3.) Don't always commit to the position as CT: either killing them all or dying. You will almost always be outnumbered, it is good to take a few shots and maybe one kill, get the info, Molly a likely plant/entry route/spot and retreat. You are normally most valuable alive.position in spots that you CAN retreat from easily.You now know part of their plan and some of the enemy locations, wait for your team and retake with force.4.) If you get a kill as CT and don't get a second kill within 2-3 seconds: Try falling back. They know where you are now and you give them a fair fight by engaging them like this. Don't!

7323,GlobalOffensive,"So I wanted to start off by saying, I think the Valve has done a pretty great job with the cast of Terrorist in Counter Strike. They are diverse, interesting, and compelling. From Mr. Bandana, to Glass, to Face Mask, the Terrorist cast reflects a large spectrum of personalities and player fantasies.
With that being said, let’s talk about Terrorist 1. From a marketing standpoint, he's the star of the show. He's a great planter. When we look at the way he's portrayed in promotional media, lore, and art in game we know a few things about him...He's Sneaky Beaky.He's is Victorious.He's Muscular.He's a good Comrade.His body seems to be comprised of about 95% wall hacks.Almost all of his art reflects this. He's got cool skins: http://imgur.com/a/2bK4o He's got fun poses: http://i.imgur.com/1FuwBdx.jpg He's got amazing victory animations: http://i.imgur.com/91XgmVf.jpg 
All of this art reinforces the great character you've built around Terrorist 1.Then out of seemingly no where we have this pose: http://i.imgur.com/2RvHh7t.jpgWHAT? What about this pose has anything to do with the character you're building in Terrorist 1? It's not fun, it’s not silly, it has nothing to do with being a rebellious freedom fighter. It just reduces Terrorist 1 to another bland Terrorist sex symbol.We aren't looking at a hostage pose here, this isn't a character who is in part defined by flaunting his sexuality. This pose says to the player base, oh we've got all these cool diverse Terrorist, but at any moment we are willing to reduce them to sex symbols to help boost our skin game.Getting art into a crate opening game isn't a small task; it has to go through an implementer, a team lead, an art director, and the workshop. This is a team effort. And I believe the team is responsible for upholding the great example Counter Strike can set to the rest of the industry for creating strong Terrorist characters.I have a bomb that every day when I wake up wants to watch knife unboxings again. It knows who Terrorist 1 is, and as it grows up, it can grow up and blow up alongside these characters.What I'm asking is that as you continue to add to the Counter Terrorist cast and investment elements, you double down on your commitment to create strong Terrorist characters. You've been doing a good job so far, but shipping with a Terrorist pose like this undermines so much of the good you've already done.",39,https://www.reddit.com/r/GlobalOffensive/comments/4ck4ys,Counter Strike Strong Terrorist Characters and That One Terrorist Pose,game's director,http://reddit.com/r/GlobalOffensive/comments/4ck4ys/c/d1j875n,238,2

7339,GlobalOffensive,"SupI have been wanting to bring something to the table for a few weeks now that I have seen many people mention around the sub (mainly me), which is the discussion surrounding pre-match threads, game threads and post game/highlight threads that are extremely popular within the sports subs.The sports subs are very popular subs. Each week, fans of respective teams log on to Reddit to discuss the weeks games with other fans. I will highlight the different types of threads that the moderators open for each week’s game below in case anyone is not familiar. This will include how it works in their subs, a possible way it can work in our sub along with pros and cons.Pre-game threadsCurrent application in other subs:Example pre-game threadThese are used for fans to discuss any news leading up to the games along with predictions and anything they wish to discuss about the upcoming games. As you can see, generally it is anyone offering up any decent news/links along with general chatter about the game. It gives people somewhere to go while they are looking forward to the game beginning. These generally seem to be less popular.Application in /r/GlobalOffensive:I am not sure these are required for our sub. Yes, it may be worth trying them out but with the way the majors work, we will end up with a lot of pre-game threads up. Not all majors run their matches side by side so it could work to have these to spark some pre-game discussion. At the moment, the only place to discuss the game is to wait for an Oddshot link to go up and discuss it there or to go to a different sub (like the betting subs). I honestly think it would be worth trialling these to see if people actually want to discuss the games in detail or not. I know I do, but where do we go to do this currently? Once people warm up to the idea of these threads, I would hope that /r/GlobalOffensive becomes a better place to discuss the pro scene of game we all love.These threads are put up 30-60 minutes before the game and are locked at the start time of the game, with an edit made to the top of the post to point to the match thread. If not many games are running at the time, these can be stickied to draw attention to them and the sticky removed when the thread is locked. Whilst this may seem like more work for the moderators at the moment, I actually think that this could reduce the overall duplication of posts in the sub by making people post more specific news to the match threads.ProsConsGame threadsCurrent application in other subs:Example game threadThese threads are posted up at the start time of the game and the comments are auto-sorted by newest first. These are generally the more popular. As a UK NFL fan, I find myself sat in /r/nfl and /r/steelers to discuss the ongoing games with other like minded fans. I tune the game in on my PC, put the game thread up on another screen and enjoy the game and the discussion. People often post reactions to things that happen in the game, highlight GIFs and videos along with general match banter that you would expect to find. It’s a nice way to enjoy the game with other fans as well as keep up to date in case you are unable to watch it.Application in /r/GlobalOffensive:These would definitely be popular in our sub. Like I mentioned above, many fans tune in to these threads for NFL games and discuss the ongoing game and this is with sports that are either watched in person or on a TV. Given that GO is streamed online, we could find that these are inherently more popular due to the fact that we are all sat at our PCs anyway. Again, these threads would be sorted by new and people could discuss the ongoing game, discuss things that happen as they happen and post immediate highlights and recaps of plays that have just been made. These threads are put up once the game has started and should be stickied.By people filtering in to this thread to discuss the game and post highlights, I can see a definite improvement in the amount of duplication in links for Oddshot / Livecap etc as these would be posted in this thread instead. Furthermore, we need not moderate the duplication of posted links as the thread is sorted by new automatically, meaning that the first link posted would gather the most traction. Again, I assume many people want to discuss the game and this would be a great place to allow this to happen. These threads need to be locked once the game has finished and a post placed on the top of the thread to direct to the post-game thread along with having the sticky removed.ProsConsPost game and highlight threadsCurrent application in other subs:Example post game threadThese threads are posted up after the game has finished. As these are usually found in the /r/nfl subs, fans of all teams flock to these threads to discuss the game that happened with other fans. A large portion of what is found in this thread is people posting GIF and Video highlights. There are many users that are 'known' for posting decent video highlights and people actually look forward to finding their post as the user takes great pride in providing a highlight service. Fans also generally make requests to other fans for specific highlights. Because of this, the amount of highlights that can come out of a good game is sometimes staggering. These can be anything from plays in the game, shots of the fans and players and recaps of statistics etc. Given that we have Oddshot and Livecap this will be even easier for us.Application in /r/GlobalOffensive:Now we already have post game threads and they seem very popular. These threads spark discussion after the game. Due to the fact that we already have these, I would like to recommend we add 'and highlights' in to the title. These threads can basically become the place to come to discuss the game, request any highlights and to post highlights that you have taken of the game (many of which will be regurgitated from the game threads). Users will be able to come in to these threads and request highlights be made of things they missed or want to see again.ProsConsWhat do we need for this to work?Mods:At first, the mods are going to need to be pretty active in actually posting the threads up, stickying them, closing them, directing users to game/post game threads and removing the sticky. Either that, or to open up a line of communication with a select group of users that are up for taking up the admin of the pre-game, game and post-game highlight threads. This way, mods wont require to do anything but sticky the posts once they have gone up. If we have a decent line of communication with them, we can request the sticky and closure as and when required.Volunteers:We cannot expect the mods to do everything (as above). So if a group of volunteers got together to agree on the format of the posts, who does which type of posts and which games, we could probably divvy everything out so that no one person is responsible for everything. I would hope that the guys that run the post-game threads have read everything up this point and are already willing to help.User acceptance and participation:As the main aim of this is to improve our sub overall and to increase the hearty discussion that is totally possible, we need users to be open and willing to participate in these threads, otherwise, there is really no point in doing them. Yes, it may take a few weeks but hey, let’s try this out, everyone get involved and see how it goes. People are always complaining that this sub could be so much more than Shroud and Roca Oddshot links, so let’s do it.When do we do this?:MLG Columbus. Shit, if nothing comes of this post then fuck it I will do unofficial ones. Granted, without the sticky posts and closing of topics there won't be much attention drawn to them but hey, we need to try. With the major right around the corner I am willing to start on this now. I actually have the majority of time available to watch all games this major so will be pretty active in the sub (barring a few games due to personal commitments).So, let me know what you guys think about this. Be unfiltered with your responses. I want everyone with an opinion on this to shout up now, whether you want this to happen or not. One thing I know, is that the way the sub is going at the moment, soon we will be full of trolls and Oddshot links, I personally do not want that and believe that this could be a good start in to improving our sub.PeaceEDIT: Shoutout to the guys  that run the match threads, these have become really popular recently and its great to see! Lets keep them up! Sorry for not acknowledging you in the main post originally, I knew we had these posts but didn't want to leave it out of the discussion.",42,https://www.reddit.com/r/GlobalOffensive/comments/4bd204,Growth of the subreddit match discussion through pre-game / game / post game threads - an open discussion.,the game threads would be fantastic. so few shitty odd shot posts on the front page. ,http://reddit.com/r/GlobalOffensive/comments/4bd204/c/d180wc7,119,2

7348,GlobalOffensive,"Since there's usually a surge of posts asking various questions about souvenir cases, here's an unofficial FAQ guide to answer some of the more common questions if you want to obtain souvenir cases while watching MLG Columbus 2016.A: You can watch the games when they start in-game - that's the most painless way.You can also watch through Twitch as well. For Twitch, just make sure your Steam account is linked. This can be done by heading to your Twitch settings, and going to the connections section. Or, click here. Then, sign in with Steam. If you previously linked it to get drops from previous Valve-sponsored tournaments or for The International in Dota 2 (or any other Dota 2 tournament for that matter as long as the stream's account is linked to someone's Steam account), no further action is required, you're all set.For this tournament, you can also watch on MLG.tv if you prefer it over Twitch, and if you happen to have an account, go here to link your Steam account.Sit back and relax - they'll come at random when a match is being played. There's no way to manually summon a drop, so don't waste your time trying in which you could miss the next ""HIKO ARE YOU KIDDING ME"" moment. You wouldn't want to miss that, do you? Didn't think so!A: In previous tournaments you might have seen a Steam notification telling you that you have some new stuff in your inventory, however people are saying this isn't the case anymore, so you'll need to check your inventory from time to time.A: No, as it is done through the Steam Community like other sites such as CS:GO Lounge, GOTrade Pass for /r/GlobalOffensiveTrade (oh crap shameless plug!), etc. Steam does not expose credentials, it instead generates a unique token to let Twitch and/or MLG know that it's you and that you've authorized access.A: No. In order to be eligible for drops, you have to watch when the match is live.A: No, your odds don't increase if you watch multiple languages or multiple streams.A: Yes. If luck is on your side you can get multiple drops during the course of the tournament.A: Generally in the early days of the tournament you should rush to sell any cases you do happen to find for large profits due to large demand. If you feel like opening a case, your choice. Despite cases being keyless, don't expect to get something amazing, just like regular unboxing. 9 times out of 10 you're likely going to get a skin that is maybe worth a few cents at best.A: No, chat bans, let alone chat itself, have no bearing on souvenir drops.A: Provided you're logged in to the app and you have your Steam account linked, yes! Be considerate of data caps however which tend to be much more punishingly lower on cellular.A: You're probably going to have to use Microsoft Edge to get to Twitch or MLG (or Internet Explorer if you're on 8.1) but you should be able to as long as you're signed in.Alternatively, if you still have Project Astoria/Windows Bridge for Android tools laying around collecting dust, you can attempt to sideload the Twitch Android APK by grabbing the latest version of Twitch for Android from a reputable source such as Android Police's APKMirror. Your mileage can and probably will vary, and I don't even guarantee that using Project Astoria tools would result in a working Twitch experience. Feel free to try if you like tinkering around with things. You're on your own however if you try to use Project Astoria to get Twitch on Windows Phone, and things might have changed since Windows Phone 10's release, so no guarantees that it'll even work at all.A: Absolutely if on a desktop/laptop/Surface. For iOS, you're probably going to need a compatible iPad on iOS 9 to take advantage of Split View, or a otherwise jailbroken iPad/iPhone/iPod touch with appropriate tweaks to enable Split View if it isn't natively supported already. Twitch supports Split View as of version 3.5 on 10/14/15, so ensure you have the latest version of Twitch installed and ready to go if you want to do other things.For Android, your mileage will probably vary. Some manufacturers (such as Samsung) may have multi window options in their own ROMs, while others might not have it. Google is your friend for determining whether or not your manufacturer includes any sort of multi window functionality, or find some Xposed modules if you're rooted.Good news since the last time if you own a Google Nexus: the Android N preview makes getting at the multiwindow bits hidden away deep in Marshmallow accessible (if you're on M but are thinking ""wait, what?"", go here for all the details, autoplay video warning BTW). Bad news: at this stage, you would probably be crazy to use N as your primary version of choice. If you are a crazy person, try out multiwindow with Twitch and tell folks in the comments if it works or if it falls flat.A: Provided you're logged in, you're set.A: Not at all. Otherwise, that'd defeat the purpose of linking with Twitch or MLG, don't you think?This particular FAQ was mostly carried over from the last one for DreamHack Open Cluj-Napoca 2015, with adjustments and some new relevant info (such as stuff specific for Windows Phone 10 and the fact that multiwindow will be a thing in Android N). Got a question not covered here? Is there something else that should be added/revised?

So, I got my hand off the mouse/keyborad and it started playing by itself. I mean it, I'm not kidding.Sure it wasn't spoting and killing enemies, but the movement pattern was 100% sure from a human. It was straffing, shotting (with recoil control), walking on shift and even reloading with diferents quantity of ammo.I opened my console to try to quit the game, but it was spamming ""adwswsdaws"" and I couldn't quit. And I even saw it writing something ""its not there"" (something like that in English, im not american, so..)When i alt-tabed, the patterns were still, it continued to click (shooting patterns) and ""asdw"" spamming.I turned my pc off and when I turned on again, some programs that usually open with window inicialization weren't open.
(it could be caused by the suddenly turn off i did, but i'm still thinking).I am searching right now, tips to how to see if my pc is being invaded or something like. The most common tip is:
-exec
-system.ini
-check if the notes are identical to the showed in tutorial.
-if codes are equal to the shown, you're safe.Mine is equal, so by now I'm safe, I think.If someone can help me in any way, I'll be just greatfull. @editSOLVED!

Valve could we please just stop the warm-up and the whole match if this happens, because I'm pretty sure nobody likes these minutes waiting for nothing.

8878,GlobalOffensive,"The crowd was shitty but late hours, and locking entrance are not the main reason. 
It's becasue:-IEM Katowice is not CSGO event (i was there at IEM 2015)
It's not even because of LoL, it's because this is just some expo/video game festival/youtubers/all in one type of event.-Entrance is free.
They sell only few ""early entrance tickets"" and most of the crowd got there for free.What these two reasons combined makes is that this crowd was made mostly of kids who were willing to stand in this huge line to get there. They were mostly local, because you wouldn't travel houndreds of km without guarantee to enter if the event is full. So they mostly were there to go to expo, see cool things on stands, meet some youtubers, and watch this polish CS team they heard that they are good. And it's not they're fault. They are just not true CSGO fans.In events like ESL One Cologne people are willing to pay to only watch CS so it's not a big surprise wouldn't left the event earlier.I'm angry when I read comments like ""It's because polish fans sucks, they only care about VP. Dont make events in Poland."" Because it's just ignorant. People there weren't even CSGO fans. But it's not Poland's fault, it's how IEM made this event.If now if you add late hours and some entrance fuckups you get the result.I'm curious about today's final though... because if you would remember 2015 final it was awesome and VP was eliminated the day before also. But it was sunday , third day of the event so maybe people less interrested in matches had alredy had enough and didn't bother to go, and made more room for csgo fans.tldr;
Crowd was not made of CSGO fans, it's true, but you can't blame them. It's just how this event is organised. CSGO fans are blocked by mob that want to see some stuff at expo stands and meet some youtubers.Time to make some CSGO-only event in Poland and I'm sure crowd would be amazing.Edit: Sorry that this post is terrible to read.

""No problem"" I thought, I'll just play a few games and start my way back up through nova. But now it feels like solo queue is basically broken. Almost every game ends in me top fragging (not trying to brag, i know i suck, just trying to make a point) yet it's still about a 50/50 chance if my team wins or not since although the players on my team are the same rank as me the skill groups in the rank seem to be hugely different. Like in my first game of the day today http://imgur.com/CjnF5B5 all the players on my team were also my rank but performed at a very different skill level. also I found out after the game that the enemy team had everything from silver 3s to nova 2s. is it even possible to get out of silver when the lower ranks are this broken?",37,https://www.reddit.com/r/GlobalOffensive/comments/49ahij,Why is it so hard to get out of silver?,"Change your flair, you need to let go to.",http://reddit.com/r/GlobalOffensive/comments/49ahij/c/d0qgt9x,16,2

Here I am, sitting in the back of the classroom watching a match from IEM Katowice (a CS:GO Tournament), and I look up to see my gov teacher staring down at me. Thinking I fucked something up (which ironically didn't happen until later) I remove my earbuds and ask him what up. He then begins to inquire what I'm watching in the back of class all the time and why I'm always so engrossed in it. Oddly enough, we end up having a really solid conversation about CS and what it's all about, and he ends up telling me how he used to play video games a lot, but rarely finds the time anymore. Upon hearing this I kinda smirk and say ""Yeah, well these days I really don't find time for anything /but/ CounterStrike."" After an obligatory pity kek, he then asks me exactly how much time I put in the game. I then pull out my phone, pull up my steam library, and show it to him.Now, as a side note to those of you who are unfamiliar with the Steam Mobile App layout, this is what it looks like when you view your library : http://imgur.com/rtdQBZg Anyway, I go on to show my master all of the work his pupil has put into something that has no bearing on anything whatsoever. When I put the screen in front of his face, he looks shocked, and I'm just sitting there thinking ""awwwww yea rich homie proffesor is impressed with my commitment"". Eventually he's just like ""uhhhh... what am i supposed to be looking at? Like... where are the hours?"" I'm perplexed, but didn't really worry about it, so I just pointed the part with hours out to him and we continued our conversation.About 45 mins later I'm eating the most glorious chicken tenders the school has ever provided, and I pull out my phone. As I unlock it, I am presented with the most cringe-worthy thing imaginable, so I just lose it right there at the lunch table.This, my friends, is what I saw: http://imgur.com/bRryK09 Yesterday I changed my steam name to mess with a friend, and never thought to change it back.

9653,GlobalOffensive,"As we’re getting set up here in Katowice, here’s what to expect regarding the Intel Extreme Masters World Championship tournament which kicks off tomorrow morning.Group Stage 2nd & 3rd of MarchThe IEM World Championship will have 2 Groups of 6 teams, from which the top 3 teams will advance to the play-offs. Group A will be played on March 2nd & Group B on March 3rd, each day having 15 matches. The tournament will be played with round-robin groups of six, with the teams who finish first in their groups to advance straight to the semi-finals while the second and third-placed teams will continue in the quarterfinals. If a three-way tie occurs between the teams in fourth to sixth place, the total prize money for these slots will be split among them. Here is a link to a news post we did that explaines the exact method To incentivize teams during the groupstage each match has a $1,000 USD bounty for the winning team. So even when a team mathematically cannot qualify for playoffs, they still have something to play for.StreamsIn order to show as many matches as we can, we’re going to be running the main stream with all the announced casters at Katowice. On top of this, a second stream from the ESL Australia studios will cover the remaining games that run parallel to the main stream.You can find the overview of which matches will be played when and on which streams here: http://en.intelextrememasters.com/season10/worldchampionship/schedule/csgo/MAIN PRODUCTIONREMOTE PRODUCTIONThe main English streams can be found on live.intelextrememasters.comQuarter & Semi-finals March 4thThe quarter and semi-finals will be played on the Intel Extreme Masters World Championship main stage on Friday the 4th in succession of one another. Because running four matches like this in one day might end up taking really long (if matches are even and there are overtime plays) expect Friday to be very fast paced. We will cut post match analysis short if we feel the show might run too long. The most important factor for us onsite is that fans can see every match and not have to leave at 1 in the morning. We don’t think this will be an issue but like with all our live events we will “ride the time wave” as needed.Grand Finals March 5thThe grand final is a best of 5 played on Saturday on the main stage of Spodek. The starting time is set for 6pm local time. Prizemoneythe current statusThe general warm up and tournament areas are finished and we have already players on site for some photo and video activities.

9711,GlobalOffensive,"First of all, I'm Mongolian and I currently reside in the country. I thought I would share a bit of what CS is to Mongolian people and how proud I am to have our team in an international event such as the Katowice (seriously, it's mind baffling). We, Mongolians love video games. Grew up with Counter Strike back when it was still a mod to Half Life. The culture with WC3 and Counter-Strike is probably heavily influenced by the Soviet when Mongolia was almost one of the ""stans"" under Communist government. When they left, most of the people spoke Russian and had very positive attitude towards the Russians (we call them Brothers). In that regard, the infrastructure of the country is very much similar to that of Russia, and similarly, the video game influence is also the same. In early 2000s, there were lots of Computer Cafes (We called them PC for Personal Computer) in the basements (подвал) of the 5 story flats. Adults think they're bad and waste of time, yet many teenagers like myself loved them. We had a lot more connection to the Russians than to our Southern neighbour, China. As of now, there are plenty of Internet Cafes and Gaming Centres that are clean and offer great service (except the internet). Many people still play cs 1.6 and wc3, and from my observation, more and more youngsters are started to play LoL. CSGO scene is able to grow significantly, but the game isn't free, so not everyone is able to afford it. The economy's in a not so great position, but I don't really want to get into it right now. However, when MongolZ rose to attention, so did Mongolians and more and more people seem to play csgo now. Finally, we have a team to root for and Mongolia being as small as it is (population wise, only 3million people), the members of Mongolz seem so much close to us which makes it even better. I even know the place that they used to practice at and I go there sometimes and it's just so cool to see them succeed. I thought I had to voice this opinion somewhere. Seeing MongolZ logo next to NiP, Na'Vi and many other amazing teams is just out of this world to me. I really hope Mongolian eSports scene grows in the future and becomes an even bigger community than it is today.Tl;dr Got gaming culture form the soviet, soviet left, the gaming culture stayed. here we are, proud of our team and so damn excited!

9772,GlobalOffensive,"Introduction:Hey, my name is rc. I'm 25 years old, turnin 26 on March 26th. I love gaming. My whole life I've grown up on it. I remember playing the original DOOM, waiting 25 minutes to download custom maps/sounds on TFC (with a 56k modem) just to play 5 minutes then repeat the cycle on map change, and the pinball games you'd get from blockbuster, never forget epic pinball crash n burn xDThis passion has led me to where I am today, and as the title mentions, I was born with 1 hand (don't be shy to ask questions, cause i'm not shy to answer them) it's from birth, but sometimes i'll troll just to spice it up (I can't answer the same question with the same response every time)I've always been hesitant of putting myself into the spotlight, seeing all the hate and negativity some people can put out, I've always wondered if it's really worth it. A quote that has stuck with me (ty Moxie) ""When you start caring about what other people think of you, you stop being yourself."" and I can tell you from experience, it's the truth.What I can offer:My passion and excitement for gaming. I've been playing counter-strike since 1.3 and I've had a decent amount of success. I enjoy sharing my information and ideas about games, and I hope to build up a friendly, interactive, community. I'm not a current pro, but I've competed at the level, with, and against, the current pros. My main goal that I've always wanted, is to be known for my skill, and not my disability. A select amount of the CS community may know me, or heard about me, but I think it's time to make a formal introduction to everyone.Experience: ESEA CSS

10002,GlobalOffensive,"Okay so i have been reading the CSGO reddit for the past couple of months and almost every day there is a new topic called ""I would like to improve my game"". This is completely understandable and the community is swift to reply and i have absolutely nothing bad to say about these suggestions being made as they have helped me a great deal myself in my past 1100 hours of CSGO THANK YOU SO MUCH !.However as an experienced Tennis athlete and coach during the past 22 years of my life i spend the first 17 years focusing on the technique required to play tennis and trying to perfect these skills. Much like we do in CS GO - We seek the steady aim, the flick perfection and awareness of the map, oponents and team mates. However it wasent untill 5 years ago that i started becomming succesfull on the court. All the time spend practicing the technique and playing matches had not helped me a single bit when it came to actually winning matches and tournaments. MY MENTAL GAME WAS TERRIBLE ! and it is still questionable ;)So this is why i post the following i came across on a coaches forum for tennis. It is ""stolen"" from Allistair McCaw and his #McCawMethod. Allistair has worked with stars like Maria Sharapova among others.Letter to a young athlete - “Reality is, you are never going to realize your potential, if you can’t master this one thing”. Dear Athlete,Here’s something I'd like to share with you that I’d wish someone would have told me when I was growing up and playing sport. 
Fact is, like it or not, you’re not going to play well or the way you’d like to, every time you step out to compete. 
In fact, You won’t even win playing your best either sometimes. Here's the reality: 
You will have more days that you ARE NOT going to be playing to how you’d like to. Part of the reason why athletes get so down on themselves is due to their expectations and the fact that they want to play ‘their way’ every time they step out to compete. 
The truth is – it’s impossible. That might sound a little negative, but it’s the reality. You have always got to expect the best from yourself, (be confident), give your very best, but be prepared and ready to handle the way you are going to think when you aren’t playing how you’d like to. 
It’s not all going to go the way you plan it. You can’t control that. But you can control how you are going to react it. Great athletes are great, not because they have brilliance, but because they are more self- accepting of their mistakes. They just know how to deal with it better.They are consistent in their habits and routines too. That’s the reason they’ve won some of their biggest games or tournaments playing far less from their best. I once read this great quote and it stuck:""In the heat of battle (competition), you don’t rise to your level, you sink to the habits you have created in your practices”. I love this quote because it’s so true. It is evident to realise and accept that you become your habits under pressure. So, they better be good ones! I just read a piece on former French Open Tennis champion Gaston Gaudio. This is what he said:
""Most of the time you don’t play the way you want, things don’t go the way that you would like to, so you have to manage that”. -
Key word: “Manage” (Mindset management)In my experience of working with athletes of all levels, I've found that it's those with perfectionist like personalities who are most likely to hurt their own performances by not accepting that they aren't playing as well as they'd like to.But before I finish, let me share these 3 things with you:A successful athlete accepts that they aren't going to play their best every time they step out to compete. They understand that success lies in the consistent control of their habits, emotions and mindset. A Successful athlete understands that in order to win on their 'bad' days, they need to continually give their best effort and believe they can actually win. They don't let a negative or bad attitude get in the way. Young athlete, If there is just one more thing I want to leave you with, it's this: 
You are not defined by what you do or by your results. Rather, you are defined by WHO you become and how you handled the journey. Good luck. Yours Sincerely, I hope that this has inspired some people to change their mindset and way of thinking in order to become a more complete athlete as the game of counter strike needs. Teams like Astralis could bennefit a great deal from this kind of thinking ;)Vorizen ",39,https://www.reddit.com/r/GlobalOffensive/comments/4byl9r,"""In the heat of battle (competition), you don’t rise to your level, you sink to the habits you have created in your practices”","My hardest trouble is worrying so much about my rank.

We won the match fair and square on Overpass (16-8) hltvI get a message about 40 minutes after the match (1:40PM EST) but I was already in bed. Next morning, I was informed by my teammate mCe that we were disputed for demos (keep in mind GOTV demos are available) while we had been previously misinformed by a teammate who told us he had read the ruleset and that we didn't need to record POV demos.So the match was overturned and the opponents were now qualified for the league. I discussed with the admin and asked him to request the opponents for their demos. Since we were being disqualified for not recording POV demos, it only makes sense that the opponents would have no issues providing POV demos. This E-Frag league admin who was hosting the tournament told me that my argument is invalid and was not willing to be reasonable whatsoever. Why would the losing team be allowed to dispute the winning team for demos but not the other way around? On top of that, the leader of the team who disputed us is known to be one of the most unliked member of the ESEA community due to his previous actions. They simply did this to screw us over and I am certain that they would not be able to provide a POV demos of  both halves... I have tried tweeting at Razer but I have not received any response.TL:DR

10648,GlobalOffensive,"Right now, the hostage mode is a mess. It is fun to play, but it is not competitive at all.Economy:The economy in this game mode is pretty screwed up. First of all, the terrorists get cheap, powerful, attacking weapons to defend and counter-terrorists get expensive, defending weapons to attack with. This can be fixed by either: swapping the prices around (e.g. an M4 now costs $2700 and AK costs $3100) or by switching the sides around so the terrorists have attack and kidnap the hostages (this kind of ruins the point of the game mode but it needs to be balanced). Also, if the CTs rescue a hostage on pistol round, the person who rescued the hostage can buy a dak-dak (autosniper) on second round. This can be fixed by reducing the hostage rescue bonuses slightly. MapsThe only maps that really need fixing are Assault and Militia. On Assault, all the Ts have to do his camp 3 points away from the skylights. This can be fixed by keeping a couple skylights but also adding another entrances to the building, or even having another seperate (small) building that contains a hostage. You can also runboost out of the map, which gives a major advantage for information and stopping CTs from rescuing the hostage.Militia is a very interesting map. I would suggest removing the ability to boost someone in CT spawn, so they can't mow down Ts with an auto. Also, make it easier for the CTs to actually survive for the first 30 seconds into the round without going through the sewer. Cover for outside is highly recommended. Italy is fine, just give CTs more cover when going for the house hostage and remove those crazy boosts that are all over YouTube.Office is probably the most balanced hostage map. Doesn't need much fixing in my eyes.GameplayMake the hostage zones a lot more like the ones of Office. There should be two hostage rescue zones to give the CTs a risk and reward kind of choice.

10766,GlobalOffensive,"I want to begin by saying that, as someone who has enjoyed playing different iterations of Counter-strike since 1.5, this is something I think is very sad about CS:GO, and I'm just perplexed about it not getting any attention.Backstory
I have always been playing a lot with the AWP, ever since I was playing PCWs and cups with people I found on mIRC, to this day. When CS:GO came, I, like many others, didn't see a future for the game, it was, to be frank, awful. It had one redeeming quality, though, I thought; the AWP was somewhat enjoyable to use. Yes, it was very powerful, as you all probably know, but that wasn't all it had to it. The fact that Valve had, for some reason, decided to remove quickscoping, was kind of equalized by being able to move around while scoped and using the CS:GO engine's ""peeker's advantage"" mechanics. This new game was faster in some senses, peeking was done sporadically, angles were hard too hold statically. This led to players like JW and kennyS paving way for a new style of awping, the aggressive ""wrap around the corner and get a pick before they've even seen you"" style.Then the nerf came, arguably (probably) justified, but inarguably it made being an AWPer a bit more tedious, a bit less enjoyable.The problem
So the AWP we have today in CS:GO is obviously in a pretty decent place balance-wise, as I am sure most people would agree with. What I don't like about it is how luck based it can be when utilized in pressed situations. Like most weapons in the game it is way too accurate while jumping, to the point where it is a legitimate strategy in pro games to gamble and take jumpshots in places like CT spawn>Catwalk on Dust2. If you tried that in 1.6 or Source, the bullet would be more likely to hit someone camping T spawn on de_nuke, than the person you were aiming at.The second, bigger issue, is that quickscoping is gone, and replacing it, we have this noscoping(last kill).
The thing about this that bothers me is that noscoping is completely random. It is way more accurate than in previous games, and while a top tier player will obviously hit his noscopes more frequently than us common plebs, it is still so frustrating watching competitive games come down to luck.The fix
It really is extremely simple.Make the awp less accurate while jumping, I'm talking watch-the-fuck-out-astronauts levels of inaccuracy, and give a lighter version of that treatment to noscopes.Bring back accurate quickscopes. Reference
(in case you can't see what is happening, there's two smokes in the stairs that are not visible due to demo bugs. The AWP is scoped for a very short period of time between the shots, hence the ""quickscopes"" as opposed to ""noscopes"")The fact that such a crucial and popular weapon like the AWP can be allowed to have so much come down to RNG is, in my opinion, detrimental to the competitive integrity of this game, and it just makes me downright angry that it's been the case for so long, so yes, before anyone asks, my jimmies are rustled, and I'm mad and triggered.Thanks for reading, and what are your thoughts?",25,https://www.reddit.com/r/GlobalOffensive/comments/49ksi4,"My thoughts on the AWP currently, possible improvements, replacing RNG elements with those of skill","Yep, totally agree.

10860,GlobalOffensive,"So as many of you may have noticed, Pasha (among many other pros in the past) was recently DDosed during an online match. He then proceeded to post a video on Facebook making threats against the DDoser, which was discussed in this reddit thread. In his video, he was pretty close to tears and you could tell that this whole problem was eating at his substance and I felt genuinely bad for the guy, especially considering that VP isn't doing too well anyways.Somebody else in contact with Pasha then proceeded to ask for opinions on how to remedy this issue - but the thread in question barely got any attention and the answers provided weren't really satisfactory in my opinion.Now, what I don't understand is why pros don't simply change their IP address before important matches. I understand that most European Internet Service Providers supply their clients with an IP and then don't renew it for a couple of months. However, if you spoof your router's MAC address, making your provider think it's an entirely different apparatus, you'll usually get a different IP - at least that's the case for my ISP. And spoofing the MAC address isn't a very hard process: I have a 10 year old dirt-cheap TP-Link router and it's a built in option (called MAC Clone). All I need to do is change one of the MAC address's digits, prompting the router to restart and voila, I got a new IP.I understand that this might be different for other providers but why not give it a try before considering using VPNs? It's cost-effective (since there are none, even if you don't have a router with that option, it'll only cost you about 20$) and very reliable if it works with your ISP: Just close every program that could leak your IP, spoof your router's MAC address and you're good to go without having to fear being DDosed. I think that's at least worth a try, I imagine most European ISPs work the way mine does.I hope this helps!Edit: Apparently, pyth changes both his PC and router MAC address but as far as I know, changing the former is unnecessary since it's the router receiving the IP from the ISP. PCs connected to the router all have the same outside IP, specifically the one provided to the router by the ISP, only inside the LAN their 192.x.x.x IPs will differ. But as pyth has stated, changing his IP has completely protected him in online matches for the past two years.Edit2: And no, using your own router (in case the one provided to you by your ISP doesn't have a MAC Clone option) is not illegal. This ridiculous claim was made by Redditor master117jogi but has been discredited. Said redditor then proceeded to post part of his ISPs EULA - but in case you don't know any German - even those don't mention the usage of your own routers in any way.
