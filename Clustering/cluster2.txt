A bit too many fouls for my liking but very entertaining.

I've been a fan of his for the past two seasons now and this was my first time watching him play live and I loved it. I was getting all kinds of side eye and comments from the Raps fans around me but I couldn't help but cheer for him, especially when he put up such an amazing performance in the 4th.

Raps win and Dame went off: this was my ideal outcome.`\WHAT IS THIS FUCKING GAME

Second things second: I hate wasting a gem like this from Dame. He had such little help. Front court played like hot garbage, especially Plumlee.

We play NO tomorrow and that's game we should be able to win so I'd hate to expend a bunch on energy pointlessly tonight but at the same time as a fan I'd love for them to keep it close for the whole game even if they lose. `\I don't doubt it--he's got game.  `\Nobody but Dame & CJ should shoot the rest of the game. `\OT?`\Andre Drummond`\Start hacking!`\17 by jim Tucker in 1955 for Syracuse`\Flop of the year.`\CP3`\Blasphemy `\If you like good shooting, hopefully you closed your eyes that quarter. `\For once can we hit a buzzer beater man?

Was it as bad as when the Pistons played in that football stadium?`\Oh, we shall.

Noah baptized him for 40 days and 40 nights. `\That was sexy Jrue`\Durant closing out on shooters is ridiculous. `\Yeah I was also expecting 3 FTs. the only explanation as to why it was only 2 would be if it was called on the floor.`\Wiz fans, believe me, I know that bashing the refs is easy, and often accurate.  But they've been pretty evenly shitty in this game.  PFs and FTs attempted are pretty even.  Both teams feel done wrong at times throughout the game.  I don't think the refs have been too biased one way or the other, overall.  They've just been too inconsistent.

Edit: And as I post this, yet _another_ offensive foul called against Portland.

Lillard is so disrespected, people really don't know how good he is. I dont know what it is but his name never really stands out, but whenever I watch him his play stands out on the court. He's outplayed so many other PG's this year but he still doesn't get the recognition he deserves. It's seriously an anomaly at this point.
`\Exactly, we never play with this type of tempo. We always slow it down, pass less and isolate more.`\DeRozen is due to miss one!`\When Klay is on, there is literally nothing you can do. No matter how good of a closeout or defense, he just shoots over you.

That's what sets him apart from the rest of the top SGs (except for Butler). He has the offense and the defense to put him over the top. As long as Butler is sidelined with an injury he's the best in the NBA imo.`\I panic every time I see Aminu dribble more than twice`\I hope that's not the only minutes that JT gets.`\how many in total were there against the Timberwolves before the allstar break? curious`\they felt lonely after you guys were making everything to start the game`\What's with all of the damn handchecking?! `\Internet tough guys like you are fucking hilarious.

We were exposed then too.  `\Keep whining.`\Whiteside isn't a star to build around and he's not going to be the complimentary player on a championship team. He is however, going to command money like he is, so the Blazers would be smart not going after him.

Edit: 17 points 10 rebounds and had the highest plus/minus`\It's hard to be objective considering how much I loved RoLo, but Plumlee has been playing tough for us, and he seems to fit this offense better than RoLo would have.  Great distributor and screener, good close-to-the basked offensive moves, pretty good defense, and hustles on the boards. `\Vonleh getting burn against the second unit is the best for him. He's actually showing how solid he is now.`\Not smart, Mo.`\Our everything seems awful today`\ . . . ok?`\He's going to be first pretty damn soon. `\The whole Duke thing doesn't help a ton either.

I like his athleticism but if it is between signing either Crabbe or Henderson I'll go with Crabbe every time.

I don't know what Jackson wants. Obviously, it's a pipe dream for the rest of the season, but our hope is that we'll be able to get better next season.

He's borderline top 10, top 10 this season for sure, but probably not overall until he does it for another year.

They don't though. I have looked for examples. It just doesn't happen unless it's an older veteran to a contender.

And if you Hendo has to play out of position, that means he is: giving up money, playing fewer minutes, and playing out of position. That's a lot to give up to stay on a non-contender.

That's really it.

Plus Crabbe has been cold at the same time.`\You clowns can't have it both ways, You can't one second when their doing good be all cocky and say stupid shit like "5th seed we coming for you" and then when we lose close games (Or games that should have won, or games that we did win which should not have been this close) say things like "It's no big deal we should not even be in the playoffs we blew everyone expectations" I don't see any other fan base that flip flops that much.

Blazers need to be accountable sometimes, You can't always dick ride a team bedcause you like them, I like Portland but I am also relaasstic, I don't even care if Portland goes into the playoffs to lose all 4 games, Long as I see Portland play in the Post season makes me happy, I could give a shit less about the other teams (I mean I watch the games because I like basketball but could care less about the outcome)

Portland fans this season have been so bad, Must be all the implants.

Not the team.`\Fair enough, just thought he might be putting extra pressure on himself`\Wow. No shit. Definitely more free throws though. `\It's like they don't realize there's a reason why he's shooting the 3.  NBA players don't just toss those up for fun.

EDIT: As soon as I posted that I knew I was going to get a half-dozen counter example replies, lol.`\Wow Lillard.`\That's a lot of missed layups in a 2 minute span.`\That girl had a nice smile`\Yes.

In Washington's case, it almost feels like genuine despair. `\John's such a great shooter`\Powell doesn't give af about McCollum.`\Kawhi only seems to take shots he's 100% confident in. `\And to be fair, Dame's been angry for a while anyway.`\that's series of taps lmao`\LMA with the "I'm a fucking Spur now, motherfuckers" dunk.`\The stupid switching onto bigs is almost always a disaster. It's an even bigger problem against shooting bigs like Dirk.`\If aminu could stop taking 3s that'd be great`\Its probably a good experience for our young team to play against such a veteran team. Hopefully they can learn something.`\So happy he's fitting in well with y'all.  I was hoping y'all would trade him to a playoff team before the deadline and well y'all kind of did.`\Who takes it, Dame or CJ? I'd penetrate with Dame. Shoot it if it's open and if they collapse CJ and Allen have shot it well. `\I was really enjoying myself. It was fun watching Normal Powell have a great game and seeing Demar kill it from the line. That 4th quarter was ass though, not a fan of lillard time tbh. It's pretty overrated.

Tough win but not even mad. Blazers have been on fire in 2016. Lilard and Urkel are the futur3. `\Will the Warriors ever beat the record for most points in the first quarter? They would've been pretty dang close if not for those missed layups. `\Yeah, but when you rely so much on jump shooting you notice that shots start falling short on back-to-backs when they played long minutes the first night. `\Cleeeeeaaaan`\Yeah I didn't notice until the replay.

I understand his offence is top notch but cmon. `\Personally I think its a mix of Warriors on fire and blazers playing average defense.`\Fuck off Nene`\Dammit Kelly`\Seems like there's been some very inconsistent foul calls.

Afflalo will do well on CJ but Calderon can't do anything to stop Lillard`\27 points with 4 made FGs. Hm.`\Why can't I watch this on league pass? Anybody else's channel not getting the game?`\They literally aren't even putting their hands up on defense anymore. Yuck.`\is curry okay?`\pat "44 inch vert" cannaughton `\Oubre is just overmatched. `\every time`\What a dumb foul to give`\Lillard looking a lot like Curry out there`\Too late, they all left awhile ago. Last 20 minutes has only been Blazers fans.`\Cap is going way up. It will almost double (to $109ish) in two years. So $12 is the equivalent of like $6-$7. I think that's very fair for a young talented 6th man.

Plus, everyone will have cap space. Fans are probably going to freak out about the insane looking deals coming out the next few years. Everything will be an "overpay."`\That was almost as bad as when Aminu tries to run a one man fast break. `\When did Dame get all of those tats? I feel like he used to only have one.`\you already have patty and Lamarcus leave us alone`\i thought u can't shoot in 0.2 by rule? wtf`\Let's go Blazers!

We've seen that arm in action, he's got a canon.`\Zzzzzzz`\can't say im not worried about this one. okc is hungry and we're not as consistent as february. `\I dunno about that`\Nah refs will make sure we can't touch the Spurs tonight.  `\Donovan is finally implementing good rotations. Finally.`\Nope enjoy LA.  I love the direction Portland is heading.  We're so much more fun to watch this year--a lot less dump it off to LA and stand around and watch him work in the paint or a 20 foot jump shot. It was extremely effective and won us a ton of games.

But watching Terry Stotts flow offense this year is a joy to watch.  We're GS (and some Spurs) lite.

The fact that we're even the 6th seed at this point of the season is just remarkable.  Whether we make it to the playoffs or not this year it will be a success.  Period. `\"Who's your daddy?!" - Mike Rice, 2016`\Connaughton`\Be ok Wes! `\This okc defense is suffocating atm. If ibaka can be at this level more often they will hold on to a lot more 4th q leads `\get better dude`\Andre pls make it`\I'm talking about the Clippers last possession.

Expect a 30-0 run starting... right... NOW!`\Ugh that was like a 40 minute quarter. Hope that doesn't become the theme for this game.`\fuck off`\Dammit. This deserves to be a playoff series and its a damn shame that it's not going to be :(`\Reviewing now, it's gonna count as 3.`\ So is someone going to foul out or what? `\UUUGHHHH`\They are hot on our tail! We need all the W's we can get. `\It shows. Are the Warriors too far away to hitch your ride to?`\Ya, again though he's expected to be more efficient vs weaker defenders, and they give him higher usage vs weaker defenders so the correlation is somewhat expected, though still impressive

If the goal is long term development yes they should force stuff through them. As is I think they have a pretty healthy and balanced offence.

Jonas's biggest issue in the post remains passing. It's not bad by any means, especially compared to similar caliber players, but it's still a bit lacking and if I were Casey i would be somewhat hesitant to run too much of the offence through him given that

The looks he should get are the ones currently given to Scola early in games. Scola just hasn't played well at all since the new year and at some point I think Casey needs to take a good look at how theyre using him`\And even though he made both, it's still a strategically legitimate decision. `\Shit I missed that.  Hilarious.`\Plumdog so hyped on the bench`\Maybe you just like Nick Cannon.`\STOP SWITCHING`\dame needed that`\It's all reputation.

(I guess RJ Hunter is mixed but pretty fair-skinned if you want count him)`\Philly played like they were mad the Blazers got a 2nd rounder at the trade deadline and they didn't.`\Strength of schedule. Grizzlies still play SA twice and GS twice. Dallas has a very rough schedule. I have little faith in Houston for obvious reasons. Objectively, the Jazz and Blazers are the better teams at this juncture in the season. Great balances of youth, talent, and team chemistry. Solid coaching as well. Don't be surprised if Memphis slips to 6th and Dallas or Houston end up 9th. My guess: Memphis, Blazers, Dallas, Utah, Houston. `\lol Tim is always so affectionate on the court.

How big is the company and is this an immediate/same team coworker?`\This is going to come down to the wire. `\However this ends, GG wizpeople. I hope you much success in the east, nice looking team. `\How did they not T up deandre? Read his lips when he's yelling at the ref`\really great game so far`\Not shooting well at all. Damn.`\What is basketball?`\Offense without defense `\Thanks Pistons `\mike rice, a sponsor's worst nightmare`\Kyle time!`\Did u bet ALL the money u saved up for brain surgery?`\'Come back Anderson you can play, they missed the fts'`\That's usually the case, because our primary is so late.  But if ever there were a year where one party - or both parties! - might still have a contested race going on by May, we'll see ads for sure. `\Shit`\Shit, I'm still kind of a Wes homer.`\lol, this stream is pickin up the players really well`\Nice. That's more like it!`\Turn down for... wut?`\He simply out worked the Wizards in OT. `\My hate for JJ Barea is unbound`\Hey, any reason Vonleh didn't start?

Not that I have a problem with it`\rarely`\Because the Warriors have the best shooting backcourt in the nba, are known for insane comebacks, and almost never lose games? And the Blazers did pull their starters.`\we're gonna lose this OT so fucking hard`\Felton too`\Why the fuck are double foul's even a thing.`\Lol Dirk like scoring against you guys. 30 and 31 so far. `\okay, maybe this isn't tooooooo bad....`\wth is going on`\Yep`\Dam3!!!`\I think Curry's mouthguard is the source of his dark powers. Like if he didn't have it, he couldn't hit the side of a barn or know how to dribble. `\Do you have a source for this quote lol? "Just because you put something in quotes doesn't mean shit".`\Playing like hot garbage. Yay.`\anotha whistle jeezus fuck`\Fuck that. Please more spectacular.`\Honestly that's fine with me. Point of sports is to beat the other team, not make friends with them.`\Dirk travels often`\If you can't get it inside, get it outside Harkless`\/u/Splash2ndCousin Can we get an Iggy ankle breaker?`\Ed looking dangerous `\what was that play LOL`\You get 3 pts ! You get 3 pts !

Everyone gets 3 pts ! ! !`\There's no way we would go after Whiteside. Olshey is allergic to knuckleheads and the price he is going to command is way to high. Olshey is all about finding value guys and team chemistry. `\Maybe the NBA told the refs to make Dame look mortal so they don't look like idiots for not selecting him as an all star.  `\3J!!!`\Steele is great, still miss Goukas but Jeff Turner isnt that bad anymore. Think they're just as defeated by this season as our fans are.`\You guys in trouble now, Roberts is in.`\He was just a sideline guy last season, I thought?  Yea, I'm pretty sure I remember them announcing that he'd join them at the table during the preseason this year.`\noah beating the zinger at his own putback game`\Lol anyone seen that preview for War Dogs? Shit looks kinda dope`\Felton with a -16 today. FUCK YOU, BUDDY! But thanks!`\lol i guess my standards for okay are lower than yours. i'm just happy he's doing better than JT`\Yeah never liked losing Patty simply because of the chemistry he brought to the locker room.  Not to mention a major factor in LA feeling comfortable to go to SA.  He had an insider in Patty Mills.  `\OT baby`\Crabbe fouls 3 point shooters every game it seems.`\Can't hit anything :(`\with that booty...everyone needs to back up!`\wtf kinda stupid ass pass was that?

Why not throw into the backcourt?`\Hey guys what if we just say fuck defense altogether and just have Dame, Cj, Steph and Klay take turns shooting 3's until the end of the 4th q?`\Jesus, get Wes out of there. It's not worth it.`\If Meyers' stock goes down because of bad play I guess we won't have to pay him that much. So there is always that.`\Ok fuck you refs. This is a terrible string of calls here in the 3rd. `\St Patty Mills`\Geez man these fans are jerks. I know you're frustrated but dang`\It's a good thing the C's best defenders play the same position as Portland's best offensive players.`\Yeah, I think her mind was blown just by... the concept of icebergs...

`\oh. Great play, though. `\Because he's just there to take some of the load off thompson since we don't have igoudala and barnes is playing inconsistent. He came out a few minutes after.`\Aminu is the worst ball handler of all time
`\Outsiders?  Haven't heard that term for underdogs before. . . `\117-115 FTFY`\DAAAAMEEE
`\Yeah. I'm watching the game on the Blazers stream and their announcers are completely ignoring the blown calls for the Celtics. I'm too conditioned by Tommy, haha!`\Deron wanted them to call a foul on Brian Roberts's chin there. Apparently Brian chinned Deron's ridiculous shoulders.`\Portland should go after Biyombo this offseason`\Fuck off.`\tonight steph do not give no fucks`\Getting really annoyed with us still running the offense through Jason Smith.`\That looked like Hendo really sold that`\Helps that that's their only professional sport. DC is obsessed with the Caps right now`\Imagine if they had a top 5 post...some one like Lamarcus Aldridge`\He knows the Mavs offense is predicated on taking advantage of teams via doubling/hedging on Dirk.

He'd rather let Dirk do you then give open threes and/allow ball movement to beat you.

He's not just guessing, he's doing this based on what he saw work best against Dirk while he was with Dallas.`\Looked like that was off JV.`\I apologize. I will limit my comments in the game thread to ground breaking and in depth statistic analysis from now on.`\Sounds good to me`\Well butts.`\Ouch`\Roberson air ball.  Game's official.`\We are witnessing history. `\Lauren for the love of God please stop calling fouls!`\Yeah, should be a good game. Not that this isn't, but  it's just not a close/edge of your seat game.`\DAAAAMNNN this games sick Crawford deeeeeeeep`\idk markieff has actually looked pretty good to me!

edit: a couple games ago, i mean`\He's a *mom*!?`\I hope we can play dame every game lol `\Melo just frustrates me when he chucks up 3s mad early in the possession. `\Radnys secrit linup`\Wait what...I don't recall seeing that. That sounds terrifying `\Dallas, after being in AA for multiple games I can honestly say that your PA guy is absolutely on my top 5 least favorite people on the planet list. Holy shit, annoying doesn't even begin to describe him.`\I want Parker to come in and get 20 assists `\Jazz not even going to make the playoffs so....`\No I love my Blazers!  `\But he didn't...`\That's so kawaii Kawhi`\Hey, man, what you do on your own time is your own business.`\Don't count out Felton, he is very good in clutch situations for us`\Good on Pop for getting on Parker for that shit pass.  16 assists, winning big, it's no excuse.`\Klaaaaay so nice`\Warriors look like they're trying to prove something here.`\Holy shit theres been 2 fouls per minute so far`\Uh oh. Jamal and Austin in. Up to now might be down 9 before the end of the first. `\I might have to tell your mom if you keep this up young man.`\Here we go! No choke!`\Lol Lillard pussied out of taking that 3. Passed it with 0.4 second left `\curry banged his knee.. ouch`\Jesus fuck, MAKE YOUR GODDAMN FREE THROWS`\Cups o the rosay`\How has Oubre been for you, Washingtonians? `\when I grow up I want to be Ed Davis`\Uhhh.... score guys.... `\What's Hendersons deals? Fuck`\Livingston and Mills tho`\Davis is just cleaning up today`\106. My dad is smartphoning it up like a madman`\He was going for the ball and Iggy actually put his body in between Lillard and the ball. Happens in basketball... Hope he is ok, I love Iggy. `\you get a foul!

YOU get a FOUL!

EVERYONE GETS A FOUL!!!`\this feels exactly like the pacers game, I'm so done with this shit`\We might need a scouting report on him, for some reason people on our team don't know what he's capable of `\Kawhi with 19 points on 9 shots.

You're a homer fan that I bet is not even from Oregon, Stop dick riding a team that isn't even yours or have no connection to.

Looking through your comment history is cancer, Such a douche bag fan boy hahaha

PS: Again keep those angry down votes coming.`\DAM3 TRILLARD!!! `\I feel like his issues are so simple. I been saying this for 3 years but its easy to tell when he is going to have an off night. He rushes his shot and doesn't take the extra split second to perfectly balance himself(even though he always has the time). Once he misses 2 or 3 its start to get worse because he starts forcing it even more.

He lacks the discipline and focus to be consistent. It's not hard to fix but it seems like someone should have told him these issues by now.
`\Agree. Spurs are the worst possibility.`\Our bench fucking blows without Dre in. `\Wall giveth, and Wall taketh away`\Lillard is such a monster, holy shit.

Regardless of lead they were still playing the champs who have an amazing record. On top of that Dame was lookin for 50. Just lots of reasons that those complaints from players/fans etc were silly.

Haha but really win or lose I'm just hoping for an entertaining game`\Dame's my fave and Blazers are my western conference team. I've been looking forward to this game for months.

Along with cheering for the Raps, I was cheering for Dame (and occasionally CJ) at the game too. Though the fans around me were giving me the occasional side-eye, even they had to admit that Dame was amazing.

Seriously, what a performance. Best game I've watched at the ACC.`\Welp`\We've rekt Portland in the clutch many times these past couple of years, let's do it again today yay `\stupid by Henderson`\Especially at home. It's quite often said that The Rose Garden is a tough place for opponents to play.`\he's close to average on playmaking, and his defense is terrible.`\Lol Plums, no way you hit a mindrange twice in a game`\oh fuck no....`\Depends on what kind of job you have.

...but today I agree with you (and got downvoted for it).  He had some serious mental lapses.  He screened Lowry and DeMar twice unintentionally.  He clogged the lane on offence (as you said) when he should have been 3 feet out to help spacing.

Overall he was awesome and his rebounds were key and hes keeping his hands up for the pass and trying to get tips but holy shit JV get some spatial awareness.

Anticipating questions about the verisimilitude of Biyombo's age claims, his agent Igor Crespo actually had a bone age study done in Spain. DX's Givony detailed the procedure in April. Here's the jist.
    Crespo says he took Biyombo to a specialist to conduct a bone age study immediately upon his arrival in Spain (Biyombo was reportedly 16). The study involves taking x-rays of an adolescent's wrist and hand to see if his growth plates are still open. Because the cartilage in Biyombo's hand hadn't fused at that point, the specialist came to the conclusion that he could be 16 or 17 at most, but not 18, when growth plates are expected to be closed.
That was two years ago, making -- according to science, mind you -- Biyombo 18 or 19 years old. Givony has reported that the agent has shared the X-rays with team officials.

Not in question by anyone who understands what science is`\Yeah Aminu!`\had a decent stretch earlier this season but now he's bad in all of the usual rookie ways

he raw`\You tried it Ed`\For this last play only I'm glad we don't have Durant on the raptors`\Let's start a GoFundMe campaign for this guy. `\Crabbe 2 apparently `\How the fuck did the rim hold up on that one?

Id think it better benefit them to go after multiple beneficial players than just splurge it all on Whiteside.

Like get 3 out of the following list of players: Biyombo, Mirza, Lawson, Dwight Powell, Eric Gordon, Sullinger, Ezeli, Bazemore, Deng. Obviously some of these combinations of 3 players could would be more than a Whiteside max but something like (Biyombo, Mirza, Powell) could cost under the 25 mill max or however crazy it is

Maybe its just me but Id rather have 1 quality starter and 2 good role players than Whiteside.`\Too many cooks ������`\kanter is a gobbler`\New game plan, blow teams out in 3 quarters so russ doesn't have to play in the fourth.

He seems like a great leader. But if Wade has trouble with him, everyone would.`\**FOUL**`\Wow. GG Portland. Hope you guys cause some serious damage in the playoffs.

Of course, what would be a Raptors game without giving away a double digit lead? Seriously got to work on that. That shit won't get us anywhere in the playoffs. Doubt DeMar gets to the line that many times either.

That pace should have been much better. Loose whistle really hurt it, even with the close ending. The refs can be unbelievable; sometimes they call nothing, sometimes they call everything. Either way, it really disrupts the flow.`\Portland isn't boxing out. Their efforts for loose balls are weak. Their closeouts are weak. Penetration is getting Celtics uncontested to the rim because the perimeter guy gets blown by and none of the bigs rotate. Portland is creating zero space on drives. They're not moving the ball. Every shot they take is contested.

We fall apart if they dont kill it, and teams crowd them with defenders accordingly.`\Just shut down derozan possession before last.`\Sure, I mean, if you're talking about another player, I guess.  Batum averaged about 1.7 turnovers per game during his years with the Blazers, never averaged more than 3 turnovers per game, and only averaged more than 2 turnovers per game twice in 7 seasons.  By contrast, he averaged more than 3 assists per game, and in his last three seasons with the Blazers, he averaged about 5 assists per game.

I get it, you didn't like Batum. But that's no reason to just make shit up about him.  `\So Varajeo has absolutely no confidence in his jumper huh`\http://i.imgur.com/NNzJ8G8.gifv`\As a mavs fan I'm choosing this time to say this " f chandler parsons "`\Those guys are amazing but they have to carry the team sometimes and Boston is a tough team to do that against.

But yes, it's a pretty safe blue state now.`\I think the early foul trouble definitely hurt his intensity. But it's also his early intensity that gave him the fouls.

I don't know where I'm going with this, but yes. `\Special ED Davis`\good game blazers.. 4 quarter really picked it up from being top 10 worse games this season`\Where are the comments?`\luckily moda insurance seems to be collapsing, so if we're lucky we'll get our name back sooner than later. `\Reactionary is this is gonna sound, I dont see the hype around him... yet... Soooo raw, gets the ball stolen and blocked so often. Not to mention fouling everything. Ughhh. Definitely agree with you.`\THE 3 AND D!!`\I think the refs are awful too. Some of the calls on Vonleh and Plumlee were really bad.

That being said Meyers Leonard and Allen Crabbe sure committed a lot of fouls that were singlehandedly their fault.`\Your regularly scheduled episode of JEREBKO AND THE KIDS has been cancelled. Please enjoy this sample of ZELLER AND THE KIDS instead.`\This would be a great series `\GG Pels.

Why don't you just check the replay if he got it in time instead of just saying "there wasn't enough time" when there actually was enough time.`\He's a rookie, I'll cut him some slack.

It makes more sense in baseball when youre talking about starting pitchers and relief pitchers but I feel like some of the same ideology can be applied to basketball. Whiteside is a great player and a top 3/4 center IMO but I dont think is worth the max. Theres some wasted money in such a contract that could be better used elsewhere `\Our Lord and Savior Meyers Leonard will bring us to the Promised Land`\Pat!`\Felton was basically riding CJ's back from the perimeter into the paint.  I guess that's ok now.

Why weren't you complaining about it then, when it was going your way?

Edit: Truth hurts, huh?`\Why not JEREBKO, ZELLER AND THE KIDS`\Lol Henderson `\That was overboard by Ed (I think he was going for a hard foul, but not a face hit), but I like that he is sticking up for Lillard.

I know, I know, the schedule isn't the only reason we're getting blown out.  Boston is playing great defense and shooting well and hustling, they're at home, we're on the road, and so on.  But it's silly so say that having played 4 games in 5 nights, and being on the second of a back-to-back has nothing to do with it. `\gonna need you to make those crabbe`\over = yes

Also like I said, at that price I'd much rather have Henderson. `\i dont even really know who im rooting for here. portland, i guess?`\Watching the game from the treadmill, already 500 calories down...`\Calm down, Bogut.`\We got that out of the system in Q2, a bit early today. `\How much does NBA League Pass cost for the season?`\God Mo is still so awkward on the camera.  `\Mike and Mike jinxed the streak after last time`\Did Felton take them from you?`\Hack-a-whoever.

It's a minor miracle he's allowed a little doubling in this game. `\A win would be nice. `\Crabbe has killed any momentum we've had this game`\yeah, the name came from the movie.`\Well, we do have Sully and Turner.`\There are a lot of things that I could say about that foul call but I'll settle for saying that it wasn't right. `\Just do it anyway.`\Moe making that slow transition to Stroman/OBJ.`\Why is the french guy teaching a true Texan like LMA how to make poppers?

I think it's in both teams best interest to think about a merger.  You cover the guards with Dame and CJ, we'll cover 3-5 with Melo, Zingis and Rolo.  It is a perfect fit.  You also get to hear Clyde and Breen all the time.  We can meet half way for games and play some games in Kearney Nebraska.

Think about the offer, no rush. `\"She's got some big.... Earrings" MB keeping it classy.`\We'd completely given up on driving the paint until that drive by CJ just now.  `\Holy shit can the refs not blow the whistle every possession please.`\Because we knew it would happen

By most standards the blazers are having a really good offensive game but the warriors have been nuts tonight`\Morris`\Jesus`\Man Henderson is fucking killing it.`\I bet the nba sent a memo that they weren't calling enough fouls.  So now they're overdoing to prove a point.  `\Wow. GG Clips. `\DRIZZZYYYYYYY`\why? sure we collapsed a few times, but we've shown that we can beat every team but the cavs so far lol.
I don't see how any team beats okc in a 7 game series if they can keep their turnovers under control.
`\That's just one of the Blazers flairs for some reason.

Plus you making a point of spelling his name wrong got to me.  When you mentioned that you find it fun I let off but still... you did fool me. `\#LILL3RD`\It depends if we go after KD. I personally don't want him, as good as he is, cause that means we have to completely gut most of our bench which is what made us so good. We need to get rid of Bogut, Iggy, Livingston, Barnes and others I think if we go for KD. `\His playoff chances were in serious jeopardy`\OH MUH GAHHHD`\Too bad you lost your bullets.`\someone has to keep up joeys legacy`\so lazy on defense`\Beautiful scoop shot Cj`\uh...well yeah this is true.`\he's just doing well at his job`\Lillard shouldn't have passed it to Henderson with so little time on the clock, considering Henderson wasn't wide open or anything.  `\Dam3!!!`\I can't believe how good we are in the 3rd now after years of it being our worst quarter`\Fuck`\Klay, so hot right now `\Look, I know your team is down but don't be a bitch`\i think whoever fouls out too many first forfeits, or at least thats how 2k works`\In his mind at least.`\*24/25 So close tho!!!`\He stepped out `\33-19 in the quarter.  That was just awful.  Please god let that be our collapse quarter.  If we can be competitive the rest of the way, we've got a chance.

Of course, if the refs continue to allow "physical play" that is the equivalent of a rugby match. . . who knows.`\Yeah I caught my blood starting to boil and I just had a take a deep breath and remind myself we're playing KD and Westbrook tonight.  Just like Harden and Demar they'll be shooting fts all freaking night long.  It is what it is.  `\Looked good to me`\AAAAhhhhhhhh`\I hate that call. What the fuck patty.`\Some would tell you that at least one of our announcers is usually rather lit by the third quarter as well...`\Two sprained ankles can't stop Lillard time `\Lol Buckhantz will be talking about a 5 second violation on his deathbed `\We gonna end up playing all guards by the 4th`\Do we not do FT drills or...? `\Hell yeah!`\Crabbe back to his shooting slump`\LMA please all we ever did was love you

Gold for a comment with 16 points? thanks blazer bros`\This really might be the worst matchup for Afflalo; he's not a great defender anymore, but with Portland running two combo guards he just can't keep up at all.

If he had stood fast it would have been a charge and he would have gotten ~~2 free throws~~ the ball back. But because he moved, he committed the foul.`\Get ready mate`\wtf why is csn bay area block in my area now`\dunk it meyers for fucks sake`\Nate McMillan was a dumb ass though, all the fans wanted patty to play over Steve Blake for 2 years before we traded him`\Toronto playing that yeezy `\haha whinny.... i'm the year of the horse I dunno what's up with everyone else though.

It's one of the few things that our front office couldn't fix or paper over in our otherwise pretty great reloading effort.

I mean, yeah, it sucks.  We both have crappy FT shooting teams.  But man, we were _great_ just last year.`\If that underhand 3 went in I would've fucking shot myself. The game of basketball would be dead to me`\Dirk has top2 old man game of all time
`\I understand new orleans has some tasty food. Its not super surprising.`\Ah right, I thought he was a pretty shit shooter. `\He has been great this year, but I really don't think he will be back. He could start a few teams, or be a 6th man for many more. With the Blazers, he will likely be the 4th wing. I wouldn't be back if I was him.

Also, if CJ gets a max ($25 million), Crabbe gets $12ish, and Hendo $8-10, Blazers would be spending $45+ on SGs. That's too much, even with a rising cap.

That's why many of wanted to trade him. It's not bc we thought he was bad, it's because we didn't think he would be here long term.

Well, anyways, I'm off to hell I guess...`\If hitting the back of the rim counted for 2 points we'd be up 10 right now`\This is already really crazy. both sides getting screwed early`\LMA on fire right now, goddamn.`\This is gonna be like the blackout of the Ravens-Niners Super Bowl

Refs don't care.`\Refs acting like cops who need to meet their ticket quota with one day left in the month.`\They have nikola vucevic at center who consistently destroys us`\Lillard started 5/5 and is 0/6 since.

Why you gotta make this ugly game even uglier `\JJ WITH THE MONEY~!!!`\Gunnin for the Griz now!`\Morris is a good player. `\crabbe another foul.. damn`\Say it with me now.`\They trying to even it up now?`\I love Demar for this. He doesn't care. He just wants to win.

Most of the previous 6MOTYs aren't exactly known for their defenses.`\He's on the bench in civilian clothes`\Well holy shit, Mike Rice was right about something.  `\DON'T YOU TALK ABOUT FOULS`\Believe it or not, the lead isn't big enough for us to get comfy.  13 in 33 never leaves your head.`\Get it brother! `\We're finally getting the game we all wanted where both Klay and Steph are hot, kind of. `\Let's just steal Crabbe instead`\Damn, Gerald Henderson, didn't know he had that kinda hops in him...!`\No but that many whistles are.`\More Dirk already?`\Not sure if serious, but he's a good shooter (although his form looked wonky there)`\i hope he's alright. he looked to be in a lot of pain and we know how tough he is`\JJ that oompla loompa flopper`\Lillard going off this game.

Couldn't hold on `\Goddamnit Moe, if you're going to foul, then FUCKING FOUL`\FITTY`\I mean, we aren't getting calls either, but that's not why we're losing.
`\This game really is something else.`\Dam3!!!`\HOLY LORD`\NOW we get our three tries.`\We used to have another one to make the Boston Cream Pie`\Aminu's voice.......wut?`\Last 2 losses have been so devastating. If we could just hit our free throws we would've been fine.`\I'm pretty sure our last 15 points are all from 3`\Sweet.  Love having the last shot with the game tied.  `\Release the Jimmer!`\Henderson got a nice body shot in`\It was sarcasm.`\Or you know that the Warriors can run off 20 points like nothing, so you want to keep your lead.  Pretty simple.`\Whistle every play`\http://i.imgur.com/976DEv7.jpg`\Man, we gotta do better on Anderson.`\Español`\Do you now remember Thursday night? That was a close game with some crazy shots both ways right down the stretch.`\OH YOU BITCHES DON'T EVEN KNOW ABOUT BULLOCK`\So CJ wound up missing the layup, but did anyone else just see him guarded tightly by LMA under the hoop so he drew him all the way out to the 3 point line and then blew right by him to get to the hoop? I really like that kid. MIP.`\come on refs bs call`\Clippers argue every single call. I am surprised they don't argue with the clock dude. I imagine the refs take extra Tylenol when they have to work a clipper game`\The kid with the big guts!`\dame 30 and 10 assists `\Henderson can combo as a SF in a small ball line and CJ is developing into a Combo PG as well so I don't see the problem. With the cap on its way to 108 Million in two seasons that is not an absurd price for three solid contributors.

Not off the top of my head and I'm not going to go scouring for examples but I believe you can't put a price on peace of mind and that if you took the time to look you would find them. Players do take discounts to stay with teams that they enjoy playing with.`\I think Crabbe is really offensively limited, super streaky, worse rebounder, and a worse (albeit solid) defender. I don't think he's going to have some revelation in his game either. Not super raw like Vonleigh. Especially as a bench guy, I value the ability to create a shot, and Crabbe can't. He's just learned to do a 2-dribble step-in from the 3 point line.

Our struggle to draw FAs is more of a big name issue. We just proved this summer that signing good midlevel guys for cheap is totally possible. `\I mean you're selling JR a bit short there and Harden was great defensively that year for OKC. But the other 2 fair enough`\POW3LL`\Dam2+1!!!`\How's that season going for you all?`\I always wonder about the season ticket waiting list - like 23k people on the warriors wait list, but who is giving up these seats? they can't sell them back right? you just get rid of them? who would do that? `\Yeah, as much as I love Dame, we need to recognize that sometimes other guys are just a bit more in sync during certain games. Dame's shooting about 30%, while Crabbe was shooting better than 50%.`\Frazier Roberts grudge match`\Mychal Thompson was the answer`\The clock started late. He technically got it in before the buzzer went off, but it started late`\No timeouts`\Well...okay then.`\Dubs reserves become lazy and always puts the risk of returning starters`\We need some scoring, we need to put the starters in`\Dame!`\Barea actually double dribbled twice there. `\That was a 5 minute cringe and a wild ride from start to finish`\he doesnt know anything about basketball`\Well that was a pointless turnover.`\If Evan Turner had anything close to a 3 pt shot he could be a superstar`\Baseball is a little different than basketball in that aspect (regardless of whether Whiteside is worth the money). In basketball a dollar has a lot more value than 4 quarters, which isn't always true in baseball.`\OMG WHAT IS THIS GAME`\GG warriors hope Iggy is healthy!`\Portland's front line can't handle Dre.`\Don't forget batting .1000. `\http://gfycat.com/SleepyPleasingGermanpinscher`\That was yooj.`\G  got mad hops `\because basketball is hard.`\I can't wait until we get good bigs... I am so bored of what we have now`\Did Dame not make a 3PT last game? Because stat tracker still has him at 168 and they had him there before last game, maybe even the game before.`\Chippy? nah more like a dirty shitstain cumdumpster named Kendrick`\Aminu starting aggressive. I like it!`\3J Splash!`\Sounds like a 90s sitcom `\Not bringing that right arm down. `\He's an RFA, I could see a team like Brooklyn throwing 12+ at him. I would be pretty happy if we matched 12mil for him. `\That should count!`\I'm too tired for this fucking halftime show. `\Our fans like to hate on his defense, but we cant play offense without him. He opens it up for everyone else, not having him out there plus having to play Shabazz Napier is a recipe for disaster.`\Oh, Meyers. . . probably would have been better to make that second FT.`\It's kind of common for teams on the second night of a back to back to start off hot.  The key is keeping the legs fresh in the fourth.  `\:')`\I want to believe that DD missed the last FT on purpose so that Portland couldn't launch any decent shot`\Aminu takes a lot of shots that he probably shouldn't down the stretch. Not just an issue of this game or a career high possibility imo`\Apparently he's scored 12 points in his career so far. Which is 12 more than I would have guessed.`\Crabbe hit a 3 and they changed it to a 2 for some unknown reason. They fixed it back to a 3 in the last time out`\Wait, why did they get it at half court, or am I misunderstanding the rule?`\Oh, they call *that* foul. `\Damn those two fine bitches just walking along the court like they're in the game. Good damn it must be nice courtside`\Dame + CJ vs KL + DD`\LILLARD IS A BAD MAN`\NEW RECORD!!!!!!`\Must be really nice being a Portland fan and knowing the refs are dicking you over `\He's a legend.`\Damn, Crabbe with the goofy buzzer beater!`\Do you follow many game threads? Not to be condescending or in disagreement, us Portland fans are definitely vocal/whiney/bitchy at times / somewhat frequently. But there's definitely a few other teams I think are worse or on the same level as us.`\    Meyers gonna need an escort out of MSG`\Lol, D league announcers even saying "its better to develop players in college"`\I don't like that D. Will looks fucking gassed right now lol `\You just keep coming back for more, don't you?

Why you mad, b? Take that L`\CONNAUGHTON`\I see that from a lot of guys on the team, Davis especially. It's great to see- I was worried that would be a thing of the past when Wes left.`\No no Raptors, you need to make _reeeeeeally_ sure he's ok. . .like, do a nice long exam. . . come on, it's for his health!`\Watching the Parsons BBVA Compass commercial just feels wrong now`\Dam3`\Just another day at the office for Dame`\gg knicks, you fans are cool`\Rushaissance?`\Overtime, thank god. `\O'Quinn can hit 3's now. Goddamn it, where was this when we needed it?`\Okay thanks`\Harkless already with ten`\wut?`\Sometimes, if the other team gets arms in the lane and switches well (like Houston did when we played them most recently) it's a really smothering method and we look like complete shit on offense.`\Gortat action figure`\So the team that is losing can keep shooting, but the team that is up shouldn't do anything?`\We usually start the game moving the ball really well, but if Ibaka is off he's way off and kills our ball movement by being unable to hit a shot. `\Looks like the refs have given our make-up call to the Spurs.`\mike rice liked those jugs`\About Lillard Thirty`\How the fuck did we get up by 18?`\just beautiful`\just pull a tobias harris and sitdown for 4 minutes dame`\Looking tired.

Worst time to play Boston. `\you lost to fucking sac last night and right this second we are tied. Your team has no future and may miss the playoffs. have fun`\nice game tbh `\No it shouldn't be lol. He caught the ball and dunked it. If he was smart he would've just tapped it in.`\I belieb in the beibs`\clever. clever af.`\Apparently the Knicks aren't`\Would hopefully speed this game up`\They're allowing a lot of hacking to go on.  `\I thought the point of a drinking game was to get drunk.. Shouldn't you drink if he misses? Or at least splits the pair?`\Both. The officiating hasn't helped either. `\WTF Meyers?`\*taps watch*

m'damian`\Why the hell do they still have starters in?`\Portland with the GSW passing
`\Dis gon b brutal to watch`\The league wants to fire him, but are afraid they will anger the other brother. `\100% he's getting ejected `\God fucking damn it`\Speights' incredible talents would be wasted on this current 9er team.`\Dafuq? Since when did Draymond have moves like that?`\WTF, Curry just grew long hair and did a back flip at halfcourt and still made the 3.`\Blazers announcers are great.

Certainly a good addition to game threads.  Thanks for doing it.`\He did it on purpose to get the win. No shame in that.`\He might as well have whistled for a foul in the first quarter now`\Man, you guys are not trash. This was a gritty game on the road against a team that has lost 3 straight and NEEDS a win. Couple breaks go the other way and this is a W for you guys.`\This game is going to take so long we might have to delay the next game.`\Im not sure they would be better if MKG had started all year he would hurt their spacing a lot`\Yeah Dame!`\This was a good win`\The Rush renaissance has been one of the best storylines from the season. I'm so glad to see that he's a productive NBA player again`\Channeling Jimmy Harden there.`\MYERS LEGEND PLAYING GREAT`\Is that a literal white flag?

What he did, in what little time he did it in.

Plus, 0 turnovers while dishing out a triple-double with that many assists is outstanding no matter who you are

edit: Ibaka, too. At least compared to how he's been playing for awhile now`\i'll just hope for the best come playoff time`\They make lots of baskets and play tight defense, just called good basketball`\Blaspheomy.

He existed there...`\Yeah Stotts just wanted to make sure Lillard was happy and got his average`\FREEEEE THROWS THEY ARE FUCKING FREEE `\That Oregon life. ��������`\Nazr about to foul out `\what the fuck? this guys been having his way with us all night. need to double him `\Where? Is he watching? I'm watching the DAL feed :(`\It's actually a pretty cool hat. I won't pay $30 for it, but it's pretty cool.`\meyers is insanely frustrating to watch when hes timid`\Well, he is. Kaman has a pretty reliable shot. He's just not as crazy athletic.`\Maybe 4 or 5 times this year. I'm not a big Drake fan but it's usually fun when he gets on for a bit `\Holy shit Damian Lillard is a monster. gg Portland hope you guys keep your playoff spot and give the warriors spurs or thunder a hell of a first round`\Who in the world would say that?`\I don't see it :/ would make sense
Edit: see it, thanks`\Uh... that looked a lot like a travel to me, no?`\Man fuck this.

They just made contested 3s and we bricked open ones :(`\Nice to see a PNW guy excelling.  Hated that he ended up on the Kings dreadfully run team.  `\OH god, brainfart. I knew that, I'm just dumb right now. Thanks.`\"I knew he was born somewhere"

Thanks Rice`\I remember his first game haha. He was so awful in that first game and we were all ready to cut him on the spot.

It needs to be his new nickname. `\*DC sports fans`\fatass with the final push of the dagger`\I was at that game and I feel like the dog gif with the cupcakes (sorry on mobile) every time I see curry. `\klay killing em`\It is funny when fans complain about teams leaving starters in too long. these are the reasons why. No matter how good a bench is, they are on the bench for a reason.

Last game people were complaining about steph playing with 7 minutes left in a 20 point game.`\Terry "Michael" Stott`\Yeah wtf `\Love Barret calling out Rice for being a homer :P`\Can we give it to DeMar on the inbound? Lowry can't hit his FT's right now.`\This game has been garbage time since the end of the first quarter and suddenly it may not be `\Wya Jordan Crawford? `\Seriously lost some hair on that play.  Jesus fucking christ.`\GEEZ, fouls fouls fouls`\I can't believe we hung on`\Fuck it just keep it going. `\ed doing work`\Yeah, total shit. Ruined the flow of the game--called way too tight.

Or something else?`\having to listen to the Blazers announcers is rough. `\We only have one field goal this quarter right? Fuck I love this team but they can be really fucking frustrating during second halves.`\Oh ok, that makes some sense. I figured he'd have a bit of a comedown after his crazy post-ASB streak, but minus the Orlando game he's been pretty lackluster, so that makes some sense.`\He says it every time Mills makes a bucket. Its the equivalent of someone from texas makin shots and him sayin 'HOWDY PARTNAH!'`\Ish is stupid quick on his first step`\Because their flairs will never fade`\They said Kings had 83 this season in one half so that might have been one. I will check the box score.`\we're leading too much`\I don't even know anymore. `\No, we can't stop now, we're in Mavs country!`\Chi3f!!!`\Portland has run that corners high screen play like 15 times this quarter`\good fans`\Damian sleeps tonight, and it upsets me.`\not when game is on the line still.`\This half time music... `\How can they call that Blazers ball?`\It is.

He obviously saw the foul and then shot, there was no other reason to shoot`\Lol`\This is intense.`\What the hell is wrong with you?`\I really love this team`\As a raptors fan and a huge Lillard, honestly could not have asked for s better game to see live. `\Hey, you asked man.

These refs man.`\The point is that Dallas' defense is stifling our two best offensive options, and so far, other than Ed Freaking Davis, no one has picked up the slack.  Which is one of the problems with a team filled with young guys, guys who haven't played much, and guys who haven't played much together.  It's a lot less of a problem than it was earlier in the season, but against good teams, it still rears up at times. `\Uh, who are you talking to?`\Well we won.

Whiteside is talented, but the league is kind of going in the opposite direction from players like him. CJ is a arguably becoming a star this year, but I agree they need one more big piece to contend. It might be naive for me to believe this, but I think Dame's status as a great player and leader combined with CJ's scoring ability will make it possible to land a third star in free agency.

If their recent trend of success continues with player development continues, signing these value guys might lead them to the finals in a few years. People were assuming the Spurs would decline every year for the past decade, but their culture and player development allowed them to stay elite. `\The Lebanese Government was trying to return them to Lockheed Martin, apparently they thought the best way to do this was to mail them without telling anyone. `\54 STRONG`\It's Ripped City night, they gave out free edibles and everyone's high as fuck.`\its not even half yet

E: i thought yall were talking about Anaheim. I was confused`\Man, i don't know what you have against Lillard, but you're stupid with all these comments to think that the dude can't ball on an elite level. I love Patty more that most people but he's not in the same league as Dame. Dame is one of the top 15 guys in the league at the current moment`\He needs to stop clogging the paint for his team-mates though.

it's not unfair. he's fucking garbage. his offensive rating is somewhere around 55-60. he's one of the worst guards in the league period, much less among starters. he's so fucking bad that i can't believe it. the only stat he's significantly good at is FT% and turnovers. he takes care of the ball well. that's it. `\It's too late for OT`\holy fuck chi3f bombing away`\If only Ibaka had Kanter's touch, or Kanter had Ibaka's defense!`\look! the softest big in the nba gets injured again

Lillard is at least trying even if he's bad at it.`\Go ahead and pass the ball to the guy who scored 40 against this team a few days ago any time you feel like`\One of my favorite parts of the game.  Stream-of-consciousness-Rice. `\If you use a very lax definition of try, then yes`\Seems like all NBA players should use that same common logic.`\A warming oven in dominos pizza delivery cars? What could go wrong?`\You learned your lesson now but just a little advice don't bet the spread on sixers games.

A lot of factors play into that. How many miles the city covers due to environment, how much business space compared to housing exists, etc etc. Metro population is what matters and neither san antonio nor portland are very large in that regard. By trying to use only city population, you're basically saying cities like san antonio, san diego, and phoenix are bigger/more important than areas like the bay area, seattle, dallas, and boston.`\Guess that joke didn't read as well as it sounded in my head`\Ed Davis.`\the dream`\why is vonleh so fucking off lately?`\This isn't even good defense.

If we could just get at least 10 wins out of this season I would be so happy`\Save us Lillard`\Wtf was that?`\It's gotta suck to score 61 at the half and still be down 20. `\Refs are typically a lot more forgiving with an initial outburst.

Portland +0.5 in second halves

Spurs +5.4 in second halves.`\Potential/36 off the charts`\Well, he did say that Lowry told him to miss. Jokingly said next time he won't miss. `\He has exactly zero post game. `\Bingoooo`\Would you be willing to give him the max?`\Agreed`\One of those things where fans have been expecting it for a couple weeks and now that it's happening we all want it acknowledged that we were right haha.

Nothing against the Celtics and how well they're playing.`\that was a pretty sweet move by anderson.`\i mean I'm tempted to believe you cause the statement is so ridiculous, but looking at your other comments in this thread you'd think Lillard killed your family. but, since your a fellow spurs fan, ill take your word and assume you're trolling

Edit: 10 assists`\Lauren Holtkamp and nationally televised games go together like shit on a stick.`\THE BALL ISN'T ALWAYS TRUTHFUL`\CLUUUUUUTCH`\finally crabbe`\I feel the exact same way. Something about his body language all game has just been pouty.

Every single time. You're not the first to complain and you won't be the last. Getting to the foul line is a skill and Derozan is elite at it.

Or are you just saying that because he's a Dukie?`\Gotcha thanks`\Damn, we're coming out hungry, so far one of our better first quarters.

Ah, that's actually pretty complicated.  Part time, or actual career setting?`\Ted has shown a willingness to do what it takes to win (at least with the Caps). When he makes coaching/GM changes he usually makes good hires, it's just that he gives guys a little too much time, which honestly is better than jumping the gun.`\Great find CJ!`\Outscored 30-12.  Disgusting. `\Dame holding the ball. No more records on his watch!`\It's not amazing, but it's pretty solid actually.

It was always a solid place to go for team meals after soccer games. That or Buffalo Wild Wings`\Jeez, guys, talk to each other on the boards.  `\yes.`\https://imgflip.com/i/10aqbs

enough already`\Westbrook not getting the trip dub darn`\They have four.

As they should be.`\Fuck you Wizards`\Fuck you Mejri.  Fuck you up the goddamn ass.  `\Damn, this game blew up`\It's still a thing. He's still trash at free throws.`\MAKE YOUR FUCKING FREE THROWS`\Ok that makes more sense`\Don't be that guy...`\Barea - classic Blazer killer.`\AD out on another injury? Guy seems like he's made of glass... Hopefully for NO he doesn't stay this way.`\Gerald Henderson is a human I'm not fond of`\We didn't even need to save that`\Clutch Williams`\I mean, there's a Six Flags as well. It's a really big city.`\yeah man. give us  Les Rapaces  `\Dame is getting humbled tonight`\Would it kill you to miss a 3 Dallas `\I cringe at the 3 point guard lineup`\Chi3f!!!`\daaaamn damon

i miss damon stoudamire.`\How's the Sauce been for you guys 76ers?`\He gets pounded on the regular.  It's amazing how resilient he is, considering.  `\Again no answer HAHAHA, You keep down voting all my comments, But I'm the angry little troll, You're a clown.

"He's totally right I have nothing to say because I am a homer fan who defends this team no matter what, Hey I'll call him a Troll then I win by default!" ThisDerpForSale`\Let's get Pat Connaughton in`\Every time Jordan goes up for a lob I feel so afraid for the human being who finds himself underneath the basket.`\i'd rather have you guys winning more than the bulls and pacers, can't shake them off us lol`\Keep your foot on the damn gas guys.`\Michael Holton is a robot.`\Oh for fucks sakes`\They were booing when he got ejected and it continued through.`\Just flinging shit at the net and scoring at this point. `\Get the rebound!`\Exactly.`\Lmao wat`\And ones don't even make me happy anymore. I just wait for the brick to hit the rim, but it feels like it's hitting my heart.`\Times like these I wish we would dip deeper into our bench. Throw Montero or Alexander out there. No way they've scouted them.`\Harvey's, it's a Canadian joint.  used to be great but kinda fell off tbh `\Its the constant rhyming I think. `\Lol`\Jason Smith you don't want none of that.`\Wow, Plumlee. Just... I know, I know. But we kept getting time stoppage and you beefed two in a row. Rough.`\Just can't get any sort of run going. `\Steph Curry range. `\������`\Payne is back!`\he was shooting when the whistle was blown for a foul on davis so it should have counted but maybe not i dont really know the rules.`\Kaman taking some of Meyers' minutes while injured I would assume.`\If he's the monster, the refs are Dr. Frankenstein.`\Russell Westbrook 17-10-16 with 0 turnovers. Fuck what everyone says, I'll love this guy worstbrook or Bestbrook. Because whatever else, he always gives a fuck`\you're dum`\Cupcake from half court?  Ok. `\I wonder if Mo gets tired of being compared to Curry. `\We've nearly blown leads in the 4th quarter a few times. Stevens is a bit gunshy about taking his foot off the gas.`\CJ IS A BAD BAD MAN`\Hendo keeping the dream alive`\Damn it Jamal`\c'mon johnny make ur fts`\dunks like kobe too`\You have to do 3`\We're sniffing at a run`\WOW what is that call`\I'd run up the score against the Warriors too. Have you seen how fast they can score a bunch of points and turn the game around?  This is a team you have to bury to keep them out of it. `\Probably the one time KD is actually fouled and they don't call that one.  Every ticky-tacky call will be called.  NBA refs.  `\Get that garbage outta heeee!`\[someone already sorted out the logo, but I think the New York Knickerblazers sounds a better lol](http://i.imgur.com/Dx2idVe.jpg)`\Whoa. Chippy like a Pringles factory.`\I've been so busy with school, I haven't had time to watch any games lately.

Doesn't look like I've been missing anything lol.`\He's probably fine; if anything it's more likely a bruise to a rib/the chest region. If they were worried about a broken rib they probably would have taken him back to the locker room.`\CJ keeps getting stupid fouls`\We're actually playing well, all things considered. You guys are just playing much better. `\Welcome to a wonderful addiction. `\And1 Plum`\lol - Marshmelo - why have i never heard this one?

I try to avoid most of the post game posts. They get toxic`\Mason Plummee you are hot garbage most nights. `\Ed Davis is a machine`\[I can only get so erect](http://www.reactiongifs.us/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/stop_penis_erect_archer.gif)`\Salah! `\Going to need to hit a few threes and get some stops if they want to have a chance. Still lots a time left but this game felt over not long after it started. Come on Blazers, surprise me!`\Drake is on one right now...In N Out is fucking amazing`\these 3s will start going in eventually... right?`\Fuck Anderson, whoever he is.`\If you had told me we were gonna score 61 in the first half I would have told you right on.`\NO THREES `\Absolutely. Kobe will go down as a top 10 player in history, while as much as I love DeMar, he's a fringe top 10 player in the league this season. `\no lol`\SHHHHHHH!! `\Yep, more exciting basketball! The reason I say fuck the Blazers is because your team far surpassed expectations this year while my team far underperformed. Seeing the Blazers do better than us stings, especially after what Lillard did to us...`\My god, if Warriors play like this in the playoffs... I can't imagine`\Ok, we don't need Dame to try a deep 3 here. . . but . . . I mean, if he hit one, I'd be ok with it.  `\Ed Davis is an animal.`\Stotts plays the Mavs so wrong every time.

Don't. Fucking. Switch.

It's not that hard. Dirk will make it on CJ and Dame`\Not bad, but they are sticking close to us. Need to stop their threes. `\I'm so glad we didn't trade 2Pat`\DAM3`\Goodnight hendo`\no foul`\Lol yeah, I saw my mistake, thought it was celtics v trail blazers for some reason`\Tfw 86 through 3 quarters is usually considered good...`\Davis!`\lol i'm sure it is. [hehestream](http://hehestreams.xyz/games/tqDMAQE?player=bitdash#content), change the stream to stern away.`\Quite the contrary.  Everyone can see what he's promoting, and his drunk butchering of the ad copy just makes it more memorable.  Hell, I don't remember most of the ads I see during blazers games, but I pay attention to whatever Rice is shilling.  Because it's fucking hilarious. `\all the vultures looking for the blazers to lose see one call in a 48 minute game`\blazers haven't got a good shot in a while now`\RemindMe! end of game. Let's see if that works.`\Nobody is safe from the Cobra`\Charlie V the worst basketball player in America`\Oh look, Davis just set another moving screen. He must be copying Bogut!`\That was just beautiful`\yeah. go team.`\sh bby is ok`\honestly I think he was being serious...`\They've never lost when I've seen them play either!  ^I've ^never ^been ^to ^a ^Raptors ^game:(`\This bugs me every time but why doesn't bogut just go glass when he's right in front of the basket?`\honestly 3pt shooting has been ridiculous this game`\I thought rush took his minutes this game. Guess not.`\He was like 0/4. Pitiful`\Yeah he's leading the Mavs in clutch points, also totally an accident
`\It looks like the Blazers entire offense depends on getting the ball to Lillard and the Celtics simply aren't letting him get the ball until theres like 8 seconds on the shot clock. Wearing him out.`\Ed.

Davis.`\I didn't know that Plumlee was a Gasol-Esque passer. `\How did they not call that obvious hack, come on. `\I wanted to see if Dame made that after the whistle. Keep me entertained and that.`\What do you listen to for the long drives?`\I wish we find a way to sign CJ, him playing along side Danny Green would be money.`\K Mart figuring it out!`\RIP free throw record`\Blazers Legend Anderson Varejao now in the game`\Clock doesn't start until a player touches the ball, not when it hits the rim.`\Kills a team like Portland who thrives on getting into a rhythm. We struggle to grind it out in games like this. There's a reason Stotts's offense is called the flow offense. `\Yep.  Sigh.  Those were the days. `\Just got it, Dame hanging his head on back to back possessions isn't what I wanted to see. What's happenin'?`\Jeezus, we run some ugly fucking fast breaks. `\/r/nbastreams -> hehe`\dam3 showing signs of life?`\Just do it anyway man. You got nothing to lose. `\he looks like my friend matt in that pic`\your boy Ed Davis?`\Calls change that. For example, if you are getting called for fouls every time you try to play defense, you play more conservatively trying to not pick up more fouls. This allows the other team more freedom of movement. Conversely, if the other team is allowed to handcheck, bump, over the back, etc. without getting calls, they become more aggressive and it becomes impossible to move the ball. See the spurs. Those fuckers are allowed to do more than any other team. Granted, some of that is good defense, but most of it is NBA fucking refs. The biggest cunts in sports. `\3j!`\HOW DID THAT GO IN?`\3J draws first blood!`\damn`\K LOWWW`\Saving him for saturday`\Gerald Henderson is a stupid bald man`\NOAH HOLY SHIT`\will update roster line up etc`\Just not playing any defense on DD anymore.  That's on the refs.  `\Well that's Bullshit for us so now we can all shut up `\I love this team!`\Damn Varejao is impressive.  Glad we got him.  Good D`\http://imgur.com/jFQin1E`\Yep. At the end of the day its still just one loss.`\there were no dark jerseys around that time tho lol`\RACHEL IN DEM JEANS`\Patty was wide open, lol. `\I'm at the game and winning is so much fun but I want to keep a high pick.`\That was a smart ass play. I was thinking what the fuck is he doing!?`\I mean that's not that unlikely though -- he was fairly open and for all his faults he is a capable shooter.`\BLOCKED BY SALAH!™`\AD go to the locker room?`\Every single time Charlie V checks in he turns the ball over, like clockwork `\Rice said Carlisle has to be thrilled about holding Dame and CJ to a combined 9...however we still have the lead and they've only scored 9 so`\**IF YOU DON'T LIKE FTs YOU DON'T LIKE NBA BASKETBALL!**`\Bismack is gonna get paid in the off-season. I don't see us re-signing him for the amount he's gonna get a FA.`\The Warriors feed says a lot of things haha. Especially Fitz (play by play guy)`\Meyers only posts up if no one is there. `\We are all Crabbe people (V)!_!(V)`\One kid was just running with the ball without dribbling, shit was pissing me off.`\Keep thinking "Damn, he's an old man."

Then I remember I'm the same age.

Fuck.`\Either way, I hope a blowout occurs. Obviously want us to win but if we lose I hope it's not close so we can rest our guys for tomorrow. `\Agreed. 4games in 5 nights is no joke.`\https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/49lz7x/game_thread_washington_wizards_portland_trail/d0syea9`\Not saying you meant that but if you think players should give up playing in the third quarter then something is wrong.

If it was like 5 minutes left in the game then I can understand your point but thats not the case.`\JJ!!!#`\Missed a charge on Lillard and then proceed to call a bad offensive foul charge on the other end. Great job refs.`\Got 84 last year

https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fancy-stats/wp/2014/11/13/the-trail-blazers-score-84-points-in-a-half-and-that-may-not-even-be-the-most-remarkable-thing-they-did/`\Count that continuation!`\Pay the fuck attention`\Christ these are some weak ass calls.`\Henderson going for a game-7 championship-winning block may never return to earth.`\Dame's the same way.

Sometimes you just need to sit it out. It's not worth it`\[(\\/);,,,;(\\/)](http://i.imgur.com//h0FptYC.gif) `\So many Portland fans i wish we had fans`\WHAT THE FUCK LEONARD`\I'm eating a lemon rn`\Hendo needs to be on point for is to have any chance. `\Weak ejection. `\Probably the Dallas game last night. It was a hell of a game `\My god we are almost in the penalty`\5v8`\No, Favre definitely sent a pic that also included shaft and tip`\http://hehestreams.xyz/games/DnAZdTD`\The Pearl isn't going to be happy with that call`\I don't think the world has the paper left to write the reffing report for this game...`\The smart thing here might be to get somebody as open for a pass as possible and then just pull a Michael Ruffin and throw it away and the clock will run out.`\Nah he had Hark's arm and shoved him with two arms. Shoving is not a box out and the red was right there.`\you just don't know their personalities.  they are actually pretty funny. `\Don't forget, the terrible blowouts recently have been against 3 of the top 4 teams in the west, and Dallas, who is battling us for a playoff spot.  We haven't performed great in those games, to be sure, but let's not get crazy.`\Refs giving you shit `\we got no defense tonight
`\D-RO!`\We're no warriors if that's what you're saying, but thanks for the compliment`\The fact that Leonsis hasn't forced every player on the team to shoot free throws granny style makes me hate him. They need it.`\Well that looked like a foul and a half `\no you implied all of our shots are "any old thing" while yall only have "a few" `\He could also average 16 if he was consistent. His shot has gotten marginally worse every season. Still very good but not 2013 levels.`\This is about to get ugly quick.  `\I fuckin love Kelenna`\"I got five on the shaved-headerson, who you got?" - The refs`\ahaha nice layup shabazz. kill me`\Weren't you guys yelling at Tony to pass it to Kawhi in the first half?  Now you're telling him to stop? You're confusing the young guy! haha`\did cuz just say g'day mate?`\I'm sure Charlie's like a nice guy or whatever but whenever I see him in the game I just feel this deep pain`\klay pls`\Prepare thy anus `\sp8s come on now`\To be fair it's less about the time and more about having an excuse to visit the bay area so I can conveniently catch a game. Just got out of college with a pretty good salary, but just not sure about dropping a couple hundred for the flight/hotel/ticket.`\He is a clutch jumper. He jumps higher the more important the play is. `\No one has come back from this much against the Warriors in the last two seasons. `\I heard it's a pretty good place. Nothing special, but good quality.`\Good move but Bogut saving dray haha`\He'll probably try to destroy the magic tomorrow.`\DAM3`\The rest of the team is still shit though.`\Wow that was some top notch coaching to end the game...`\I'm sure Curry is fine. That said I was just thinking how great it was that he put the injury-prone label in his rearview. It's virtually unmentioned at this point.`\# A Concise Game Guide for Tonight

And a win of course

GL Blazers


Thunder up!`\Lillard has not watched a lot of defensive Drummond tape. He looks real tentative to drive on him`\I don't understand how he can run straight into every single screen, its like he has no peripheral vision.`\UTAH WON BOYS`\Drinking and smoking this week? That's a lot to take on. `\Looked like he had him boxed out, i agree blazers havent gotten many calls. Just thought that one was wrong`\My Dirk's bigger than yours.`\Î dont know if i want derozan to make both FTs and break the record or miss the second so they have no time to get a shot.`\Leonard had improved so much. Smart play and great pass. `\Someone gonna punch out Henderson `\KNOCK IT OFF CRAWFORD DAMNIT`\Everybody hold on to your butts`\He was heating up but they just gave up in the 4th`\Lowry is killin the pick and roll tonight`\WTF Plumlee?`\Lol. Both teams on a back to back. This is ugly.`\Well, Plumlee is hitting his jump shots lol`\Does DeMar lead the league in And-1s? I swear he gets like 3 a game.`\I know, but you'd think he'd have gotten it by chance at some point.`\Wish Ed Davis stayed with us. That contract looked amazing when he signed it and looks even better now. What a beast`\Lol I know right, that block was as clear as day.`\Salah hasn't had enough minutes the last few weeks. He so much fun to watch `\blackouts are always bullshit`\I think the most impressive Blazer as far as what they were at the start of the season to now is Aminu, Anyone else remember when he was just a mess, a complete ball hog and would just take insane, impossible shots?

Watching players get mugged and not have fouls called during actual play while a gentle hug grants a foul drives me fucking nuts. `\me and my friends all started calling him Kobe after Henderson gave a post game interview earlier in the year and he mentioned Kobe was/is his favorite player. Those long (usually fade-away) 2's have taken over Aldridge's long 2 void he left. not sure it was a void that needed filling though... `\Lol right I thought the same thing`\Nope, just Damian Lillard. `\There's a difference in letting it fly when the quarters about to end and dribbling for 10 seconds into an ISO brick, but ����`\It's on!!!`\Asian girls everywhere...`\Yeah I really like him. Doesn't make many mistakes and plays good D. He does foul jump shooters a lot though `\I'm still worried cuz CJ and Lillard can totally catch fire and drain 4 or 5 3s in a row`\i hadn't until just now. amazing stuff.`\well the blazers play tomorrow so its going to be bench vs bench`\The game was over, dude.  You're delusional if you think that a 10 point lead with less than 20 seconds is the time to be dunking on the team you're beating.  Just freaking out of your mind.  `\They call him mini kobe for a reason`\Absolutely money.`\CJ starting up`\There's not a lot of "fuck you" in Lillard's shot tonight.`\Deal with it `\Bench pls. Bench no.`\Mo Speights missed a garbage time 3. Sad day.`\Lol Portland tried to out rebound each other `\There was an arm extended behind him, didn't look like that to me at all.`\CJ you beast!`\ilyasova is not working at center..`\That was a really obvious foul on Plumlee`\Hopefully pop tells Parker to give Kawhi the fucking ball`\ya that's holtkamp cp3's rival`\FLOP`\Powell taking over!!!!!!!`\Klayups...`\bob fitzgerald is the worst, i'm sorry.`\and you won't believe what happens next!`\CJ starting to assert himself.`\If you could summarize this season in one number, it's probably "3"`\Damn 9 already`\well i didn't edit at all, you just read it wrong. Sorry but you're wrong.`\I CANT TAKE THIS ANYMORE `\How many possessions have they had where they didn't score somehow? Like two? Maybe three?`\Man, we bricking like crazy`\this halftime game is hard to watch`\Haven't seen Plumlee contest one jump shot this game.  not one.  C'MON MAN`\holy fuck that kid looked like a young(er) stevens`\its 75 in parts of texas and colorado.  most states it is 70 though`\Blazers soft in the paint but there have still been a few uncalled fouls already`\Stop chucking DD`\Harrison Barnes remembering he's in a contract year.`\CJ with the beautiful spin move`\Seems like Curry and Lillard need to practice flopping more.`\Damn Russ had like 2 min to snag the fastest triple double record wouldve had it had he not fallen out of bounds for his 10th board..`\Or, Dallas is stifling our two best offensive players.  `\fk man so close

GG Raptor fans.

`\Lol MB called Dame McCollum. Looks like the Mikes are even tired themselves.`\What a gross, wonderful sequence `\That's a kind assessment `\Crabbe knocks the three down aaaannnd three in the key`\Do you wanna see a final score of 200-175? Cause that's what's gonna happen if you wish that. `\if I had to make up a reason, I'd say he looks like some dude whose just trying to lose some weight at the gym, yknow. arms a little flabby, baby-faced. and yet he plays in the nba.

If I had to.`\Dam3!!!`\Ugh. Open look after open look bricking`\David Lee is starting to bug me.`\3J!!!`\Common CJ and Lillard! Time to go off this second half. `\> underachieving

Except, Dallas is doing better than everybody predicted.

You should learn the definition of words before you use them. That would make your attempted insults more effective. `\I mean youve hit 15 3s at a 50% clip and are shooting 55% overall, thats not exactly bad.`\we don't that's why our guys rest in the 4th, but i didn't mind what you did, lillard was close to 50 hes gotta stay in imo`\Thanks for that game Golden State. We must of absorbed some of your soul.`\This big guy for Dallas is so terrible. `\Hard to do when any attempt at defense is a foul.  But even that aside, they've been shooting the fucking lights out.  Absorbed some GS magic or something. `\we got it`\he changed his flair lmao`\moooooooving screen`\We don't call him 3J McCall'em for nothin (we don't actually call him that) `\HAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHA....... shut tha fuck up puss nugget `\Really looking forward to this game. Two of the probable frontrunners for Coach of the Year facing off in the "Who Did Brooklyn Help Most Bowl".`\Please somebody help me out with a Mike and Mike stream. If I'm gonna listen to a crazy old homer I would prefer he was on our side.

edit: nevermind, looks like link 5 on firstrow is blazers if anybody else is looking. `\Westbrook took it easy on Damien there`\that was a funny segment they just did of "ask the Blazers" `\They fought hard to make him miss his 25th FTA.`\wtf are you talking about lol`\y'all lost by 21 last night maybe you should worry about your own defense before coming after ours`\fuck yeah noah`\LMAO STOP WITH THE FUCKING WHISTLE`\Aww I really wanted that play to finish.`\What did they say?`\Holton: "Well, the plan is to get the ball in, obviously."

Thanks Holton. `\If he was walking down Hawthorne he'd be Gerald Trenderson`\Is this game not on FSSW?`\Lauren, I may want to hug you, but I also really wanna punch you right now. `\I get down voted for calling a spade a spade ha. How many games have we been unable to finish this season? Pat C and Brian Roberts should by now. This is fucking pathetic.`\3J!!!`\DONT LET ME DOWN`\Thats weird - he should still get the record.
He still sunk the most free throws in a row without a miss in a game regardless of whether he missed the last one`\CRABBE (V);,,;(V)`\Pretty much every Blazers fan has it down as a loss.

4th game in 4 days, back to back, on the road.

I mean, we're a young team, so maybe it won't matter, but still`\Nice of the Spurs to give Portland fans another excuse to drink.`\Bad omen when we are missing this many layups`\Lmao salah thank you very much`\That seemed like a bs call, but I feel like were owed a few`\47 FOULS AND 62 FREETHROWS`\Ha, makes a lot more sense now`\Yeah, it was a good decision. Although, he honestly probably didn't know there was a record on the line when he did it. It's not a super well known one haha`\GG Dallas`\When did i start watching a hockey game?`\HISTORY!!`\JV got him in the back there.`\i hate our new watermelon logo..`\Alright so I'm looking at basketball-reference for most points in a half records....all the records are held by 70s, 80s, and 90s teams.  2 highest scoring halfs in history both happened in 1990.  And these mother fuckers complain about weak defense now?`\Time to stop listening to this game and actually tune in.`\She usually gets a small because she doesn't like soda that much`\Damn we haven't played an OT game all year?`\Amazing `\Cap is going up to 90 from 71. Or a 28% increase 12m =9.4m

I'm also reluctant to see how many teams are throwing maxes around. I don't think many players are gonna get maxed, who is gonna spend 100m+ on a player with one good season`\Lillard looks absolutely gassed.`\Well, guess the refs really don't like any contact on the head. `\wanted to see lillard back`\Bugs are nasty af`\Don't sleep on Gerald Henderson's hops `\i dont know his name. Higher voice, obvious New Yorker`\I've got everything right so far except Purdue losing `\Parker with 8 assists holy shit. `\So it goes.  See y'all on Wednesday.`\He wasn't. He was literally walking toward the sideline.`\Stotts, I like these.

Please start incorporating Brian Roberts`\Seeing you getting pounded with downvotes like a little bitch _does_ make me happy, actually.  `\That was filthy`\LILLARD!`\I doubt that happens. `\he aint sleepin`\Kanter has been evolving lately. With some defense, he's an all-star. Hell, even his defense has been better.`\Chesapeake snacks`\3J!!!`\yw for the downvote`\REFS STOP`\"Boston has lost 2 games ... Annnd sixers are just sixers.."`\Sarcastic cheers are the best cheers`\Well Blazers have 7 fouls and the wiz have 2`\1. CJ, please stop turning the ball over.
2. Ed, please never take the ball up the court ever again. `\18 ORB

Only reason we're in this`\Hmm, that answers that question I've always had: Can you get called for 3 in the key if you have the ball?`\Just realized Westbrook had zero TOs with 16 assists. That zero turnover game is honestly more impressive to me.`\Davis KILLLING`\Ok, GIVE HENDO ALL THE SHOTS`\There's CJ's token blocked layup for the game`\Good ears.`\he only signed for like 7 million a year too`\Thanks. How do you feel about the Wall Star nickname?`\Huh, nice.  Thanks for the explanation. `\Lol they counted that. Good ole ref ball. `\Is Plumlee always that soft on defense? `\Just making sure. I felt so torn watching that, because I knew it was the smart play, but I wanted him to get the record really bad. `\> It was fame and cj vs the NORTH

`\Drayyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyeeeeeeeemond.`\It's the sunken eyes.`\I want to like Dame especially that he's from the Bay but I just can't get over his complaining. `\Did Nick just cuss?`\Isn't plumlee pretty good this year?`\Yeah. Seems low for someone with his experience.`\maybe but they're roles are so different that it's not really an apt comparison.

The only reason CV is in the game is to stretch the other team's 4 out to the perimiter. Thats not what JA is being subbed in for. `\I imagine crabbe and aminu and cj somewhat will be a bit more consistent next year, this is their first years being subjected to these minutes for so long.`\PLEASE GOD what has Toronto done to deserve this?`\dam3 with 30`\Tfw when ur team has 61 pts at the half but is down 20 pts... `\surprise GSW have that many FTs given to them. Teams barely foul them in games at all. `\good to know my feed is like 2 minutes behind`\Uh, yeah... That's the last thing we need...

Lillard has dysentery!

McCollum died from typhoid!`\3rd quarter always.`\We miss you Rolo!`\Aminu.`\40pt quarter nbd.`\Man, these two teams just keep going. Blazers are like a Warriors-Lite and I really expect them to blossom even more next season.`\Klay spitting hot fiya`\It's like he's in slow motion...

and yet they still bite on the fake!`\Spun em like a running back`\JESUS CHRIST`\Indeed.`\Angry pop  (｡•́︿•̀｡)`\Guess the refs feel the need to make this game competitive. `\The blocks have been insane.`\I remember thinking Crawford might end up being a piece to hang on to. Fortunately for fans of the CBA we did not. & cheering for Jeff Green was like manic depression man. So such great peaks & such tedious valleys. I still have a lot of love for both of them though, & really hope Jeff Green can find consistency.`\Lillard with the 3, DD gets the inbound, 2 free throws for the record and win`\[My mom made it! Opa!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gV4fKaM7eA)`\Well I'm glad I don't remember that.`\I guess that's fine.

It's just pretty clear that we're a better team with another guy in there.

I love me some Vonleh -- certainly haven't given up on him -- but if we want to win, he's not our best bet. Playoffs aren't the time for development.

Unfortunately, I'm sure you're right.`\Nah...  There are plenty of PA dudes who sound like ~~WWF~~ WCW announcers in the league, e.g. "SPUUUURRRRSSS BAAAALLLLLLLL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"  I'll acknowledge that our guy's hype can get a little out of hand at times, but there aren't many who avoid it completely.  I'd rather have an organ player, honestly...`\MAKE A FUCKING SHOT GODDAMN`\True. But he wasn't nearly the baller he is now. That doesn't count. `\Tim Frazier is a smaller, younger Alvin Gentry.`\Oh, absolutely.`\phew !`\Ha yeah lets pretend no other team sets moving screens...`\lol`\Yeah I bet Mason and Henderson will get some shit from the other players about that tonight`\I know you gotta play hard but down 20+ you shouldn't be diving into players.`\Oh my fucking god get a board`\noooooooooooooo--we need this win more haha`\What the fuck?  Why is there a T on us?  `\only thing I'm bummed on is that I saw the Knicks when they came to pdxspecifically  for porzingis and he just doesn't show up in these games

too bad , but he is the future. I mean outside of the Blazers `\Barnes thought he was in for another poster `\>Dallas, HOU, and Utah are all better than the Blazers. Have fun at 9th

>Pottland:The only team in playoff contention that's going to be swept by the Sixers. Fucking nice.


>I CANT FUCKING BELIEVE I BET ON PORTLAND'S -7 POINT SPREAD, YOU GUYS ARE FUCKING BAD AND AREN'T GOING TO MAKE THE PLAYOFFS. FUCKING SCRUBS


I respectfully disagree`\>"[Spongebob Squarepants- Im A Goofy Goober Rock](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mi74Oswr_Vc)" - Length: 00:02:39`\ah, so it wasn't blocked? Pretty sure that means it should be a foul, then. lol`\And totally unintentional, too!  `\Lol`\Ref is blind as fk`\I didn't realize Sullinger was this fat. No hate, he's a beast in 2k but he's a major dough boy`\Sully's got some moves goin`\I WANT TO BELIEVE`\Dang. He got way too open.`\YouTube stream`\Klair ball`\Overtime! Overtime! Overtime!`\I meant how early in the first quarter... Wasn't it within the first 6 minutes?`\Yeah, was surprised to see Lillard do well at defense there.  And he had some other great hustle plays on D.

He also got lost on some longer defensive possessions and lead to some open shots, though.  But loved the hustle`\I'd like to see a couple of postups for Vonleh on second unit guys. The more he develops that the better off we will be. `\This is a game we should model our gameplan after every night. Everyone did what they're suppossed to and no one had a particularly outstanding night (relative to their skillset).`\Conference tournaments.`\Iggy lol holy fuck`\What shoes does DeRozan wear?`\how did half a second run off on that?`\Like... how is any team supposed to build up momentum in those circumstances?!

I feel that way about a lot of games. So many fucking fouls it's ridiculous. Let the guys play, refs.`\Blazers fighting themselves for the rebound and lose it. I guess that's better than zero effort and losing it, right?`\Duncan looking to get Saturday off again against the Warriors, fake coughin callin in sick `\correct`\Well I'm sure as hell glad we didn't get scheduled a game against the Thunder at this point in time...`\the backcourts are the only thing making this cancerous tumor of a game enjoyable #pray4demar`\and its not even close`\Shaqtin' MVP audition by Plumlee.`\3J!!!`\sick`\Quit yer bitchin'!`\Ok maybe put the starters in again`\WAKE UP MAVS! `\Ugh CJ, you made that shot really hard`\they are ok at some points but even after they see a replay they will continue to just say something we all just saw did not happen. `\Jrue!!!`\Lol, that was so easy. `\https://media2.giphy.com/media/jQqU9dCKUOdri/200_s.gif`\Lillard with 100% look`\Well that sucked.`\12 in a row (at home)! Refs still couldn't stop us having an exciting game.  Also I knew this before but fuck Lillard not an all star is absurd.  He deserved it over LMA hands down.

`\it was never really in question`\The atmosphere at the Garden is great, less obnoxious atm since the Celts have taken a backseat to the Pats and Bruins in the last few years. `\All teams get bullshit calls.`\Lillard is a bad motherfucker. plain and simple.

`\Yeah Meyers on Melo no thanks. `\ I see Thompson has brought is third-quarter shoes for the first quarter `\yes make ur FTs`\Holy moly when did Klay score 30?`\Why not`\So did everyone miss the Blazers' announcers commenting on Steven Adams late in the second? One of them said this: "he looks like that creepy guy in high school who stood by the tennis courts and smoked cigarettes" `\I definitely do. He'd be great on this squad.`\Cmon Ed. You gotta make those.`\I don't know man. After that blowout I have a feeling they'll be back with a vengeance, especially since they'll be at home. I'd sure love to be the one to break their home winning streak though. Can you imagine the Blazers beating the Warriors twice this season and be the ones to break their home winning streak? Reddit would literally implode.`\How is Buffalo Wild Wings? Never been. Do like Fire On The Mountain though.`\[Thank you for the motivation](https://imgur.com/55MWqhs)`\nice sesh`\True! Doesn't matter though, let's get this win tonight!`\Gotta say, Donovan came out and did everything I wanted him to do tonight, as did everyone else. It was amazing.`\I bet Dame wishes he was comparable to Curry tonight. `\Because Houston.  They will suck themselves into the 8th.`\YOU SHUT YOUR MOUTH IT'S NOT OVER YET`\I like him. His 3-ball is pretty good and he's a lanky defender. I cringe whenever he leads a fastbreak because he usually has blinders on when running full steam and doesn't pass out of situations he should.`\OKC are not very smart though. Kanter is a bench player lol.`\Yeah especially with our schedule only getting harder. Our next 5 games aren't going to be easy ones, and 2 of the next 3 after that are against the Mavs, which could mean a lot in the standings.`\Refs were like okay fine we'll call something in favor of Portland (minus that obvious missed call on KD).`\Hoping the guys won't be too tired because this should make for a great game. GO BLAZERS`\I gotta say I laughed on that last one.`\damn the Blazers scrubs are killing the Spurs.`\blessings dude. love toronto. thats my second city, aside from LA!`\AND THE STREAK CONTINUES AFTER HE SHOT THAT FROM FREMONT`\81 point half Jesus...`\I was on a demo team when I was younger. jacked up my foot one time doing one of those 540's on the hardwood. `\Shit that's big.`\Omg.

It's generally an offense-for-defense switch.`\Does the starting backcourt play all of the 4th quarter, blazers fans? `\That would have been the NASTIEST 3`\Boston Celtics vs Portland "Celtics West" Trailblazers`\Leonard is now adding LeBron-chasedown-block to his arsenal.`\They were playing well in the first half.  And the Lakers beat the Warriors, so that means nothing.`\Other ref with a clear angle overruled it`\Id say RJ too but he's light skinned `\Washington's worse. 60 is normal. I feel like a madman over here. `\Just turning on the game... *Enes Kanter runs in transition*

*up 23*
Fuck. What happened???`\Yeah Moe!`\44 fouls

8 more to tie the NBA record for most fouls in a game

edit: im wrong, this record was just for one team`\Wow thats even more impressive in slow motion`\Just tuned back into the game and holy shit @ DeRozan going 21/21 from the line..`\Get em!`\Lillard 1-8, Henderson 1-5, Crabbe 0-5, Roberts 0-3 :(`\Nah, blazers losing benefits the mavs `\(VV);,,;(VV)`\It was one I saw real time, which is more than I can say for most of the game.`\We're obviously playing extremely tired.

(and also it was definitely a 3).`\GET THE REBOUND clap clap clapclapclap`\Or maybe you guys just made us better?`\this game has not disappointed so far`\irelli for March coach of the month!`\Scared?`\Rather be unoriginal than live in Oklahoma. `\Ok, I got really confused. `\DAM3 TRILLARD!

I can't seem to find it.`\This is gonna be a great game. Gonna watch it during accounting. `\dame got fouled lol `\Dude fuck Henderson`\YO VONLEH WHERE DID THAT COME FROM`\wasn't this exactly everyone's problem with the previous coach?  maybe people need to wonder if this is actually a coaching problem or a personnel problem`\That's all ball`\GG, good luck in the rest of the season.`\Come on. That's gotta be good. Psh.`\I just turned the game on. Gonna go ahead and nope myself away from this one.

The fuck happened?`\So, I didn't watch the first 3 quarters, but it seems like the only thing Westbrook did poorly is free throws.

That's a monster fucking triple-double, especially for only 28 minutes of play`\This is a fucking joke and as an NBA fan it's actually embarrassing. I've never been more butt hurt about a basketball game in my life`\It's weird cause the Bruins got good right as the Celts fell off. I think now that the B's are looking stale more people in Beantown will start showing green.`\Aaaand now he's even hitting the fucking layups.`\Lol at the pump fake. No one should fall for that. `\This is a pillaging `\Replace ASG skills challenge with a HORSE tournament and a knockout game.`\The Bay Area has a large number of hot asian girls.

That's a rarity`\this game is sex right now `\He fits the same mold. They both have to play a different style than a lot of other guards who have size and because of that they try to avoid contact as much as possible(or avoid blocks). Tends to make contact look minimal until after they release the ball.`\This DeMar guy is pretty good at foul shots apparently. Maybe we should re-sign him`\Demar with 31 points on 5-14 shooting `\A lot of time it seems like they are very zoned in and don't notice that hte other guy is going for the rebound.`\That commercial gives me the heebie jeebies`\Username checks out. `\Hendo looks better now because is also five years older and this is ACs first year getting minutes. I think Crabbe will be a much better player long term than Hendo. We aren't winning it all next year, so I would definitely rather have the better long term option.

Blazers have tons of cap space and a history of not attracting FAs. What are we saving cap space for if not to re-sign our own young talented players? `\What's going on? I switched over to a grass-growing live feed.`\Hope Demar is okay`\oh fuck right off`\If we don't win by 32 or more, this is basically a loss

`\apparently they did bad cost assessment on how much services would cost and underpriced their premiums so maybe it's not surprising that they couldn't do that kind of cost/benefit analysis. `\But why does he care? He's not in the running for MVP and it's not like he's playing for a contract this year. And frankly if you're putting your FG% above a shot at three free points then you're an ass. No, he probably wouldn't have hit it, but the fact he didn't try is just dumb. `\Temple setting the best screen`\Fuck that. We have a punchers chance against any one besides spurs and warriors.

Fuck me `\This might be Damian's worst game all season. Ironic because he's coming off arguably his best. He's done nothing but whine all game. Has taken terrible shots.

It's so good despite the refs!`\24/25 free throws made.... damn i wanted Derozan to own that record so bad :(`\this is gonna be insane.`\What's going on with the liliard shot? I dont have audio

Good on them! `\Ouch. Looked knee to knee`\he scored 9 in the first 3 minutes of the game, he's so hot right now`\Didn't lose by 30 i'm happy`\This is some bullshit `\Wow. Clutch time 3s all around.`\JC IS SO MF CLUTCH DAMNIT

I'm honestly just watching this for good basketball. With the Thunder game tonight, I don't really want to pass Portland lmao`\We're averaging like a foul for every 2 possessions this is fucking ludicrous`\.9 PLEASE GO`\If we lost this game, our season wouldve been over. You don't recover from that shit. `\y tho`\He's gettin lost in screens and not closing out and giving steph space.  `\I understand they should play thinking it will go against them but that also means instead of a wide open layup you may go for a harder three to "tie" when in reality the layup would've done it!

The really should just review it right away in the last 5 mins or even once it hits 2 mins and anything is unknown next stoppage no matter what wether a made basket, foul or out of bounds.

But anyway it doesn't matter as it seems Mavs will win anyway unless Portland argue that Aminu took the 3 looking at the score thinking that's what he needed `\I had both!! Got UCON and Butler wrong, though.`\Is it bad that I want Russ to get the first half triple double?`\What was that about home cooking?

Meh. Is what it is. I'll get right over it.`\Why can't we have that?`\That must suck to watch `\C'mon, lets be real here. You know what you did. You then commented like an asshole. What the fuck is wrong with you?`\Funnily enough the Ducks this year had Oregon Trail themed uniforms. Not like the video game or anything. But they each had a different topographical map of the state on them. And the jumbotron in Autzen had funny little Oregon trail 32 bit graphics like the ox cart and the duck in a canoe. It was pretty rad.`\Who doesn't?`\They, at least, know the play is under review.  In reality, they've already heard that it was a three.  It's a non-issue.`\Hm he hasnt even played in the 2nd half`\You shut your dirty mouth`\Too far away, they might have gotten a hand on him but couldn't wrap him`\THIS IS SO HYPE`\I do but I hope this is our last bad season for a long while. This team has sucked longer than its been good its why they can never build a fan base.`\CJ shoved Tim in the air on that 3. FLAGRANT 2`\It sound like it'd be fun for a blazer fan, but to a neutral fan, it's not the best`\Not to offend you, but you're extremely lucky to only have to go through one rebuild season, and then get blessed with three hall of famers, and 2 superstars. We've never had that same kind of godly luxury. So we'll boo, because we're sick of losing.`\I refuse. Its obvious I'm a Celtics fan. Screw the gang mentality.`\Looks like CP3's knee and Brian Roberts hip bone collided `\What happened to that salty Sonics bitch boy that was talking shit earlier? Yeah, that's what I thought.`\Ya for sure. Nice win earlier. Only got a chance to catch the end but it was great. `\plz iguodala is ok`\M3y3r$!!!`\come on fam, lets get to 80 at the half`\the polish teddy bear?`\Oh, well, that goes without saying.

My point was, don't just swipe weakly at the dude.  The refs - particularly in this game - are probably going to call the foul on him anyway, so foul the dude hard to prevent the shot.  Mejri isn't a great FT shooter (this game notwithstanding), so it's better to stop the shot.  `\because he's cooler than cool`\I absolutely can't get enough of all the Blaha-isms!`\I was gonna try and catch the home team fuck up whoever they're playing.`\its our fourth game in five nights. and back to back. u should be worried about your mavs `\Not really. If anything it's the opposite.`\Come on now.  Don't be like that.`\For which record? I thought we beat the fouls record already (wasn't it 52)?`\And I thought it was bad coming from Logan County`\Let's go Roberts!`\At least I got to hear the Mikes tonight...`\The game flow is slipping into Chaos. `\I only caught the end of the replay but was it not all ball?`\Hehestreams`\he couldnt handle that booty`\Tackle him if you have to, just don't give up`\oh what the fuck`\Don't screw this up boys`\A lot of people think cjs shooting is a little more refined. lillard definitely has an 'it' factor.`\I don't like them much either, lmao`\Jimmer!`\As long as we play the long game, we have a chance.`\Washington made it 63 games before going into OT? Wow.`\Andre's passing continues to improve.`\shut the door here blazers. we have a tough week and a half coming up. we need to be playing good basketball`\Justin Bieber on the Blazers`\i wonder how much meyers will get next year?

9 million?`\wrong, it was meyers both times`\Coach Dame, working the refs.  `\Why because we have the same amount of guards in the all star game?`\Wash will try to get Hendo tossed later. Baseball him.`\Man, Pat's looking way better`\Cj is dicing up this defense`\I too love this Bill Kennedy mic. We need to mic up refs more often to hear the players.`\Casual reminder Vonleh is athletic as fuck`\He's been pretty aggressive driving to the hoop so far. Hopefully he keeps it up`\I would love to pick up a scoring big man in the offseason.  Teams know almost all of our competent scoring is our guards and doubling/playing far out shows how stalled up our offense can be.`\Back-to-back fouls on one possession, tying the record!`\5 fucking 9`\Right? I can't believe he would come back... to the sixers
`\That was a nice ass play `\He really struggles to fight through screens. He hardly ever covers elite point guards when Temple is in the game.`\Bruh.....`\FLIK OF DA WRIST`\Let's hope so, haha. `\To whom are you talking*`\Probably just a lot of turnovers for both sides.`\RELEASE THE KAMAN!!!`\How's Mason Plumlee been? Has he improved from last season?`\PatCannon Time! `\klay better be coming back into this `\Not even *close*. You must feel like a real horses's patoot right now.`\Sanders wins Michigan!`\Sometimes not the very start, but typically.

Like, our big men aren't good defenders, and they foul a lot, but this is getting insane.`\Should I switch to the Knicks feed? `\I love Timmy`\I'd say Harris' defense in really erratic not really sure what we'll get game to game.

I'd still say he's better than putting Charlie in. `\Ed is a problem for the clips`\watch me quit this game, come back in 20 min and it's a 2 pt game`\Yeah but we play Golden State on friday so it may not last. :( Those games on the 20th and 23rd against the Mavs are really going to determine our place in the standings.`\Wes!!!`\It's wouldn't get that far, they would force a timeout to review if necessary`\a fucking wonder of the world`\yeah man, that's the logical assumption to make there.`\Nene with the Dwight Howard clank`\Secret agent Aminu ty for bricks`\4th on drummond!`\Uhh....that was a pass`\Mission accomplished!`\All he can do is shoot. Except he can't shoot...`\Never shit where you sleep. `\Plumlee averages a little under 2 more points per 36 mins.  But it' smore than just the points, it's the offensive flow.  Plumlee is a better distributor.  The offense tends to work a little smoother with him in there.  `\He missed both!?`\If it's 2 minutes left in the game, I agree.  But it's the third quarter.`\well somehow my parents house has NBA TV so i guess me and 6 other people will be enjoying this game`\Plumlee's been a little sloppy so far.`\Too many times to count.

You guys are just dicks. `\That's true. I think dubs just came out super angry cause of last matchup`\Klay  should be in wtf kerr`\HENDO BLOCK`\... No foul there. `\This is a messy game on both sides. `\Spurs used to play in a football stadium around the same time`\looking at our squad..I am honeslty surprised we're doing this well...like Demar and Kyle are elite but the rest of the players can easily have terrible nights and I won't be surprised..`\I don't think that's how it works...`\Lmao wow Melo`\I always forget that Rick Carlisle started off in Portland as an assistant.  `\yeah, i thought it was because i was on mobile, but i haven't seen any hate. maybe some kneejerk assholes around big plays, but it's definitely not the general consensus. a lot of people love him around here.

edit: i meant "here" as the bay, but i think it works for the sub, too. `\Warriors are pissed about how Blazers ran up the score last game they played. They're going to try to do the same to them.`\Think u r a bit slow on the uptake. So let me break it down for you.

Team is not out there thinking they have to 'payback' with any strong conviction. They just want the W, doesn't matter if it's by 10 or 1.

Now the next point: If it's not some grudge, then it must be because of some rivalry or a potential playoff opponent. Which is the case with GSW and Portland, especially at that time.

Now next point: We beat Cavs by about 30+ points. Remember how they embarrassed us? No? Probably cuz you're a moron who probably bet some money and now bitching about it. Don't apply this 15 year old logic to pro players.

`\Which part?`\So does anyone have the gif of that Wall dunk? Preferably in slow motion so I can actually see it this time?`\This team is all heart.


I love it.`\Honestly every time I see Stotts i think "That looks like peyton manning in 10 years"`\Kawhi is not a role player lmao `\Oh my fucking god Wall`\I concur with you, my friend.

The truth is NBA players are people and many people value continuity and community. Its why the spurs are so strong, it why we have had such wild chemisty the second half of the season. If Gerald values that over minutes or being on a championship (the cliche reasons for discontent) then he will not leave.

Dame has bricked 3 open 3s, two absolutely wide open.

Meyers bricking, Hendo bricking, Plumlee bricking, harkless bricking.

These are open looks. They're just not falling`\I got Aminu. He seems like he's got a deep reservoir of rage bubbling just below the surface. Seems close to losing it somewhat regularly.`\Considering the refs whistle, they can shove it up their asses.

Shit happens. `\IT too short, Dame with the gentle block.`\What the hell are you talking about?  He dunked the ball with less than 10 second left.  The Mavs were up by double digits.

This year teams with good centers have given us a lot of trouble (Okafor, Vucevic, Dwight, Brook Lopez)`\eh

boys will be boys`\I mean, I think moreso that it's a similar situation in that the Warriors bench started to drop that lead. Dame wanted 50 and I'm sure Portland just doesn't trust the bench enough against a team like this no matter how many points they have on them.`\Jesus. They can't fucking miss their 3s`\Salah Slam!`\Wes got that shot back`\Probably because the game isn't quite wrapped up yet.`\I mean, I like a good straw man argument as much as the next guy, but you really need to do better than that generic shit.

Hopefully we can return the favor this game. `\Well we'll take all the breaks we can--need this win any way we can haha`\At least he was conscious enough to realize he said the wrong thing. `\Austin Rivers wears D Lillard shoes...`\He was basically out the league for 4 years, lucky for him that Phil Jackson was happy to bring him back.`\Which is funny considering how much they do it to other teams.`\You obviously did not watch Dame the past 3 years else you'd see an improvement in his defense.  *improvement* being the key word.  I have not claimed that he doesn't give up big games.  He plays in the west not many guards can guard the pgs in the west on a night in and night out basis.

It's only his fourth year--I'd be concerned if he still played defense like his rookie year.  What you saw tonight was him EVERY. SINGLE. GAME. that year.  `\/r/ripcity, check the sidebar.

p.s. Two days rest, third home game in a row.`\what are these pussy whistles gawt dam`\Looks like Dame's 20+ streak ends tonight at 15 games. `\Pssh, I wish!

It's literally the only thing he does well.`\? We won a game after GSW... We just had a 6-game road trip then a home/away/home and now we're on another road trip.

Phoenix).`\And he dribbled three times traveling halfway down the floor with zero time coming off of a .8 second clock.   That is what you should be talking about.  You can't foul after the game clock expires, after all.
`\Our starters.`\Happens with San ANtonio too. "THey're old, they can't win with all their old guys resting." and then they do. It's just genuine disbelief in something so fantastic unfolding.

He grabbed his fucking leg. That's not trying to gain balance.`\We could pick up ground on the Grizz and Mavs today, and the rockets are up against Toronto.

I seriously worry about running into a ref irl. If I was sitting next to a guy at a bar, and he told me he was an nba ref, I think it would take a lot of composure to not hit him with a bottle.

The Pats are hard to gage since they haven't been bad in so long. The Celtics are for sure the fourth team. Even back in the Big 3 era when they were more visible than the Bruins they still probably weren't "bigger." For example, my grandfather & uncles will come over & the whole family will hang & watch the Bruins.

Kawhi plays great D and gets a couple more defensive rebounds a game, but he is not the play maker/facilitator that Lillard is and doesn't match his offensive prowess.

I don't know why you included Draymond; He is having a great year, but not akin to Lillard's. Chris Paul is having a good year as well, but still I don't believe it's on Lillard's level. Lowry is also having a great year but not on par.

I would rank those players for this season as:

Curry
Durant
Harden
Lebron
Westbrook
Lillard
CP3
Kawhi
Lowry
Draymond

People dick ride Kawhi here evidence of /u/HectorButler below, he is having a good season but nothing like Harden's.

`\What an absolutely PATHETIC effort. Embarassing. `\sweete baby CJ`\GG. Was hoping for a closer game obviously but it never is between our teams. Hope iggy gets better.

Based on the box score the Blazers got screwed by the refs, yet only lost by 2.`\Yeah, good plan, but that'll probably never happen.

EDIT: [Here, take this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Q6n5NE6Cb4)`\Was at the game tonight. The Blazers fan absolutely love Ed Davis. After Dame, he had the most signs for him.

And daaaaamn Daaaame! He's so clutch.`\I see a lot of comments saying that Tony has 16 assists. What's more insane is that he has 16 assists in 21 minutes. That's an assist about every 90 seconds. Wow.`\Seriously, first Violet Palmer and now Holtkamp. Like, I'm pretty sure there are good female refs out there. Actually find them.`\That's why they're undefeated at home `\"Soft ass shit" lol`\I respect the red white and blue uni's but man do I miss those sweet AI sixers jerseys `\I fucking love Pop.  `\Knocked the wind out of him. `\Yup we are damned lucky to have him. Love that dude`\Ball is life. And it don't lie.`\It's the end of a tough road trip haha`\nice break fellars`\hes just being dame`\Lets Blaze some Magic.`\Nah, I get what he saying, but I just wanted to talk a little mess. But just a little.`\They tried in LA but didn't get DJ`\It's always amusing to see someone being salty at winning`\Vonleh with the Porzingis like putbacks`\Man, this bench pisses me off so much`\At least they are consistently bad I guess. `\Yeah. Although It was really his fault. CJ didn't use the pick very effectively so Meyers had to move Last minute.`\I feel like if we did literally anything in the last 30 seconds besides what we did, we would win.`\Lillard's been making some bad passes so far.`\Crabbe's been shit lately. Not hitting shots and fouling a lot.`\Lol @the crowd after he just torched your asses.`\CHI3F`\Dallas has no answer for Ed Davis and I'm terrified about what that means for the world. `\Cause one of the teams is from Portland...`\was the call reversed? wtf happened there?`\Now we got bad blood `\Gortat looking surprised by every pass`\That's okay Meyers. Strongest drive I've ever seen`\Wow, I feel stupid. I saw stern home and stern away and just figured they were different stream options to make sure they functioned correctly. Good lord thank you. No more hearing those awful announcers.`\How much money they pay you refs? Paul will double if need be.`\Not sure why McCollum didjt touch the ball last possession `\MOOOOOK!`\Smart got a shape-up, nice.`\Shit is crazy, demar bout to beat CB record.`\Lillard getting exposed defensively `\We've been getting hosed all night.`\Meyers Leonard makes me so angry lol`\Dude, I'm complaining for both teams.  Was talking about the bs CJ foul on Morris.`\Yeah, he's really been declining`\lmao`\Why is it so easy for Parker to pull the defenders?`\Let's  fucking go patty thrills!!`\At this rate the dubs will score 150 this game regardless lol.`\Entire Boston crowd loses their shit
`\I like your username.`\I don't know how that's a foul, but considering it was called a foul, I don't know how it wasn't for 3 FT's.`\Meh. I think it looks worse than he intended.

He'll get ejected though.`\Same, I just felt bad for him. Honestly cringe worthy.`\he's a smart team player who knows he can get a better shot for the team`\All of a sudden both teams with 18 three pointers `\I'd keep watching, but I'd really let it ruin my day. `\Actually he grew up in LA and idolized Kobe. He mirrors his game after him, with the pull-ups, fadeaways, drives, free throws, etc. Obviously he's not at that level yet, but if he continues to develop his three its not crazy.`\HYPING FOR A HALF COURT SHOT`\I'm honestly just happy that wasn't a 3.`\DeRozan is going to get 60 with all these fouls`\Dame is looking to put this game away early. `\Did you guys know Orlando is only 5 games out of the playoffs as of now?`\I want dame to force the issue. Hes trying to take whats being given. Not gonna get a rhythm like that.`\Portland just hit 4 back-to-back contested 3s in a row. They remind me of the 2012-13 Warriors. `\Let's go Blazers!!!`\**DIRK IS THE REAL VINO**`\bad calls both ways, refs have too much control already`\Meyer's is trying to show the organization that he should stay.`\The audio is irrelevant.`\Back off you can't have him`\One of them said elite, I think it was the color guy.`\I'm 0-2 in bills games (in the last two years) and 0-2 in Canucks games too actually... Maybe don't buy don't buy me tickets. `\Steph Curry doing an impersonation of a 10 year old right there.

^^expectingthedownvotes`\Damnit, Vonleh, you fucked up Dame's 10th assist!`\SO MANY FOULS WTF`\shit I'd have put my house on Lillard hitting that 3 :(`\http://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2016-nba-picks/

Awkward `\It's only fun when they're making them. Not like the ASG or something where you expect highlight dunks and get ugly 3pt chucking contest`\Lebron & KD with 8 million straight 10+ point games.`\I hope you guys get GSW and give them a run.`\Gortat was furious he thought they didn't count the bucket lmao`\I am not a Kawhi dickrider lol, first time i've ever been accused of that in my life. His D and the Spurs record is what makes me fairly certain he'll finish above Lillard in voting. I'd rather see Lillard finish higher in the voting, but realistically I think Kawhi will finish higher`\https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GEbgtvOfr8

=)`\So the question is, who gets whistled for this? DeMar is clearly down, Lauren! What will you do!?`\Wdf ur so fast`\you are not beating the warriors or spurs in a seven game series, they're too good

and other than this game the thunder have been blowing games left and right, they're the worst they've been all season`\You can't possibly be Canadian.`\im confused on how he gets a beautiful pass and then misses a layup so open that I could have made it`\nice pump fake from barnes`\Lol that's rich`\i have uva winning it all right now!`\That was fucking rough. Well done OKC.`\big ass flop there`\Lol. That kid bobbing his head behind Kerr right there`\How bout just each teams player goes one on one in ot,  first to 5 by ones wins the game `\Why is Harkless playing so few minutes lately? Just been bad? Hurt? He was on fire a month ago. `\Dame misses the easy 3 and drains the impossible off-balance 3.

Because Dame things.  `\he thinks hes damian lillard`\Man, we can't hit anything`\I love you, Rice!`\Jeez, that's a cheap foul.  `\awww shit. Hoping for a good game. GO BLAZERS! `\Turner with the sixth sense `\Let's go Moe!`\Here we go
`\Ball don't lie `\I'll give you that, but a trip from Vancouver to Portland is actually longer than it takes for anybody from Houston, Dallas/Fort Worth and Austin to get to San Antonio. All the other smaller cities surrounding the area aside. And Those are really big cities we are talking about there as well.`\Why is Temple taking that shot`\Roberts with the handle! `\Records will be broken this quarter`\If they're gonna call fouls please just let DeRozen shoot them all, I want his stat line to be as insane as possible`\It was damn near every other play. It was soooooo bad.`\Yes! Love that`\Stotts is gonna get T'd up if the ref's don't start calling some fouls`\That sums up this night`\Yoga pants`\Can't even stop them when we do play solid defense.  `\Yep`\Freelo`\Try defending, it helps`\80 point half come on.`\I'd say this is more interesting :D`\First game, they blew us out.

Second game, we blew them out.

Third game, they are blowing us out.

Fourth game should be interesting. `\I hate losing and I especially hate staying up late to lose :(`\hoping crabbe can develop into a form of Danny Green. `\Norm with that d league carry over

Bruno next in line`\The real mvp`\He could eat shit when he was on the Hornets too.`\They can't miss.  Calm down.`\He's like a flasher with a small dick. Can't help it even if it lowers his stock.`\Lollards pretty good at taking those mismatches `\foul, foul, foul`\Perk went around Dame's head and neck (going for ball, but Dame was past him so he did go for a foul).`\Do you live in Oregon?

If so, I can't make it..thats like as far as possible from where I live`\I would be ok with this `\shut..up`\War of the North for the rings.



http://imgur.com/LuyaA8h`\"lived up to the billing"

please Barrett, it's okay to admit this was a pile of shit`\I'm not enjoying being on a three game losing streak. I'd enjoy a 4 game streak even less. Let's go Blazers! `\Come on CJ Lillard, lets snap this losing streak`\why is Kawhi not in???`\Well, GS missing layups so thats good. `\And this is a big step in the right direction? `\GS's bench at oracle is a different kind of beast`\I fully expect to lose this game`\wow lillard mustve completely blinded him if he crumpled like that`\It seems like Lillaird is getting fouled as much by his screener as by anybody on the Knicks, twice he took a bump from Davis and got a call.`\Fuck on`\I've got him on fantasy he's super solid. But I think there's some weird stuff going on with minutes between him, elf and jennings? Maybe some Magic fans can comment. `\Crabb3!!!`\I miss it too.  But the silver lining is that without losing Wes, CJ never has a chance to emerge the way he has.  I just wish he could learn Wes' defense.  `\OT?!`\DIRK SIDEBAR?`\I can't believe that this is a competitive, exciting game after that first three quarters.  `\Haha, it defaulted to one day.`\Dubs may give the lead back, but....WHAT A QUARTER!!!`\OH HEY CHALUPAS!`\Lol

That can only happen to us.`\Offense is stalled. Lets put Meyers in... `\Fuck man. I JUST WANNA SEE THEM PLAY WITHOUT A WHISTLE.`\Anderson Varejao looking like Hakeem`\Fuck the three point line......`\just end it here and say the wizards lose to save my heartbreak `\wizards ball`\The forearm never shows up on reddit for some reason. `\Yo Cupcake when's that 50-piece coming?`\Thizz Ed!`\bernie aint never finished`\Same reason why there are NBA flairs. They a bunch of bitches. Or maybe international. Or international bitches. `\Cameraman with the middle aged white New balance. Nice.`\Dam3!!!`\No Beal no Anderson no free throws = loss`\Well, at least we scored 20 this quarter.`\You keep saying in this thread but there was literally like a handful of people(nowhere near "everyone). He is having a bad game though(offense and defense) so I can see why he might see some negativity.`\Meh.`\Ok teams should start benching important players.`\Crabbe is a teetotaler.`\He started the season with plantar fascitis(Sp?) after switching to new shoes then when he came back from that he injured his knee in a new Orleans game (a different knee than the one he hurt in the playoffs last year). He played on it for a while and then got it checked out and the doctors were basically like Wtf are you doing playing on this knee and he went for arthroscopic knee surgery. They ballparked 6-8 weeks to come back which is right about now and word is he's looking good, but there has been not much news about his return. Word is that he'll be back mid to late March though. `\Say hello from the outside`\Well that was a weird sequence. `\Lol it had to be said. I respect Dame's game and all, but c'mon.`\Klay Thompson's 3 pointers make me wish I drank. (fun game, though)`\Barnes *always* plays with the second unit, he sucks`\......haven't you taken enough from us?  Go steal KD from OKC.  `\Holy crap, what the fuck Kyle. Make your damn FT's.`\I thought he wasn't taking the bow and arrow to Dallas?`\low key best beard in the league`\Anyone just see Kama grab Nazr by the hand there and pull him?`\John Wall with a wide fucking open 3.  You've got to be fucking kidding me.  How do you not SMOTHER him?  Fucking deserve to lose this.  Fuck.`\No kidding. I know their job is hard but it's really hard to be satisfied when they don't call things both ways. `\Please don't tell my mommy.`\It worked last time. Also, at this point, our only real shot is to play fast.`\Disrespectful.`\Lol what are they booing for? That's obviously in the cylinder...`\whoosh`\Not bed, it's an armchair`\Wow they're gonna call fucking everything aren't they`\We may be up 30, but I am still afraid of a fourth quarter collapse. Please Thunder stay in the lead`\Just tuning in. Any reason AD has played so few minutes?`\Camera man down!`\Oh i misread your comment, my bad`\Blazers fans -- have y'all been happy with Aminu this season? I loved what he did last year, especially balling out in the playoffs, but haven't kept an eye on him since he signed in Portland.`\yup`\When you;re out of control towards someone or something you run right into it or reach out your hand to slow down? Because most people reach out their hands to slow down/catch themselves. Hence wrist guards, hand guards, etc.`\Plumlee never had a chance to get into rhythm due to his foul troubles, but it's a situation that he put himself in.  `\NO TWOS, BACKCOURTS ONLY, FINAL DESTINATION`\Ugly play and poor shooting by everyone but Aminu.`\Dame should have shot from further back. `\One more 3pter for NBA record most 3s in a game?`\And all the comments are "Parker doesn't pass"

I hate Spurs fans sometimes`\Yeah, we aren't going to make a comeback if Kanter keeps playing. No one can stop offensive centers `\You can continue watching. GSW still getting baskets anyway..`\Goddamn, make a fucking shot. `\Nah, that's okay. We should really keep pressing. `\Bro.`\>@AminESPNL: I love Dame but he gon learn today`\That Hendo three looked like a two.  `\Oh John....`\yeah hugging a dude is good defense`\Sorry East Coast peeps, you gotta stay awake for OT.`\Throw in Pat, see if he can have a game in his hometown. `\Nobody else does either. Really could have used Beal tonight `\At least there would be a game to watch. At this rate it'll 4 on 5 or 4 on 4.`\What's rolos problem right now. I'm at the game and man he is pissed. Yelling at everybody`\Even if they could get some of those shots to start falling, it'd be hard to come back without having the energy to play a lick of defense.  `\Meyers GOAT out of bounds passer fuckin bullshit put those points back that shit beat the light`\We'd probably have like 2 losses`\Think either team will break 100?`\OKAY. RemindMe! 95 minutes.`\More than the execution? Hitting a guy with a hard foul on the back should not be a flagrant 2 at all. Unless the context is an extreme one intent should not matter. Not like things were escalating to an uncontrollable degree for the refs to send a message or anything.`\Nah, some of us are really spoiled and expect to win every possession.  I used to be that way myself.`\I'm weak as shit

Kawhi just raised his hand for the ball. It was so polite`\welp the jazz are currently down about 25 points or so, we're gonna need this one to be a victory for los clippers`\Not bad at all it just seems like he has more.`\cut him`\Last season was great because we could see glimpses of what our players could be when they were given some freedom to figure out how to play together. Trying to install this offensive system this year has been like a teenager trying to wear his dad's old suit. It doesn't fit right and it's blowing up what little game we had in the first place. `\Desperately needed that win, too.`\It's close, but Lillard does drive more (39 more FGA in 2 less games). Lillard, stats-wise, is up there as far as not getting his share of calls when compared with Harden, DeRozen, Westbrook, PG, etc.

Harden is a total eyebrow-raising statistical outlier, but PG is more surprising - he doesn't drive nearly as much as Steph or Dame, but has way more FTA. And Gallinari is basically a professional FT'er.

Neither PG is getting star treatment, or even undrafted FA treatment.`\Fantastic game! Blazers kept coming and Dame is top 5 guard in the league. Reffing was suspect.`\DeRozan goes to the line more than Harden it seems like. The difference is that he actually tries to score first and doesn't flop.`\This seeding clusterfuck has forced all of our fanbases into unnatural and uneasy alliances.`\Kawhi still hot`\What the fuck Holtkamp`\Nah just rest. Game 4 in 5 nights do that teams. `\Same here, 4-0 this season with the games that I went to.`\L3G3ND!!!`\dame carrying this shit`\Can we just have a second game thread where people bitch about moving screens?`\nice hustle bogut`\Chi3f!!!`\When the Warriors are up by 30 in the 4th quarter will they put Curry in for some payback?`\I think its a yellow warriors hat. I have one like that. `\42 minutes yo`\Still a weakness.  We're that good.`\FUCK THE ROCKETS!!!`\we got a great core, competent GM, top 5 market, promising pick in 2016, and owners, albeit stingy, loaded and waiting to give the green light. we'll be good for a bit i think. *fingers crossed`\lol good point`\Damn.  Right.  It was a long time ago.  I just remembered the 'Chris James' part.`\Ed davis looks like a mini Deandre `\Martin's not shooting all that well so far and we need him more for that.`\Nah you guys are a great team.  We're in the game, barely.  But I watch a game to see some action and flow to a game.  Not this whistle after whistle nonsense we have here tonight.  Portland is reaching a lot tonight--we have those road legs right now.  `\PATTY THRILLS`\Wtf not fouling?`\Were still ahead of you in the standings, chill`\I believe it's called autofellatio`\That Charlie V defense. Smh. `\    Dat one ref looks like a buff pee wee herman loool`\dame being pushed all over the perimeter`\Knicks don't have a 1st this upcoming draft. Gave it away to get Bargnani I believe.

People still have some hope, not sure why. I watch almost every game but spend minimal time following what the media is saying. However I do get some sports radio in while I'm driving and it seems like hope is finally dwindling. Some people are clamoring for more pt for jerian and fredette. A lot of talk about Phil Jackson. Very weird spot for the knicks so the scattered priorities makes sense.`\OH GOOD a Coors Light plug before we can hear anything about Demar`\Everything is a foul. Fuck the refs today man`\This fucking mario guy airballed like 20 free throws`\SESSIONS`\GORTAT`\Why is Ice Cube wearing sunglasses to a basketball game?`\He banked that in.`\Giving up on a tie game get out of here you bitch`\that was even cheesier than dame's hah`\without iggy the bench usually struggles`\Shit...`\Man that footwork by Andy.`\THE LOB!! (silence)`\Thank you Hendo`\We're getting all these stops and not doing anything with them.. If we converted a couple of these we'd be up..`\Referees are still blowing their whistles too, but close games are exciting regardless of the refs.`\Haha, that Ed Davis flex sign`\Drummond gonna go big tonight 20/20 inbound`\Gotta stop the ball on a fastbreak!`\DeMar has looked really good so far. A couple of pretty shots. `\No way `\For some unknown reason I really like harkless.   `\Fuck this officiating crew`\Curry's 3 didn't look like it was going in at all lol i think God is guiding that ball`\WR Meyers Leonard!`\Our lord and savior`\Our rebounding has dropped off lately`\That pistons game earlier in the year was the worst loss of the year imo. there was like a 40 point swing or something in the 4th? This should be a good game though!`\HOW THE FUCK
IM DONE`\Battle of the frosted tips!

Crabbe, Smart, Sullinger all rocking the same hairstyle.`\Realized contract signing season is coming up real quick.`\DO YOUR THING WALL `\I think so. But I think it's sort of just come to signify his toughness and determination at this point. `\seriously... /r/nbastreams`\AD needs to learn that Dirk move`\Dear lord, not overtime. Please just let this mess end.`\ouch`\mad props to that one dude dancing damn`\I guess Stotts forgot about his timeout.`\CHI3F!!! He had allllll day`\Lol that takedown by Davis on Wes.`\There are like 4 pistons fans in here so im throwing my hat in their ring`\Need more Lillard vs Timmy Frazier`\Lol thanks. I live closer to the college, so it isn't all bad. Some pretty good looking girls in Oklahoma. `\I thought it was the opposite`\Oh Ed. Almost my favorite.
`\Wow. That's not basketball. `\Looks like Dame wasn't the only one mad about the comparisons to Curry`\SIT YO DUMBASS DOWN`\Yah definitely, that point total is just so nuts. I can't really remember the dudes on the nuggets back then`\Yeah, it helps for guys with their back to the basket or if their view is onstructed`\AHHH`\I can't play guitar but I can sing better than him. 100%`\Def a weak point `\This 4th quarter is a trap.`\we choking hard, god dammit bench!`\Finally calling that moving pick!`\if he wasn't such a risk for totally imploding the minute he leaves miami i think we would offer him the max`\Yeah Roberts!`\Holy shit Aminu, that wasn't even close. `\They won't get close `\I want to see this OKC show up for the rest of the year. Except April 6th. `\holy shit that guy airballed like 15 straight free throws`\HES BACKKKKKK`\Fo sho`\We rlly suck at rebounding and defending the 3`\let's go dinos!`\Shout out to DeMar for sacrificing the most FT made in a game record without missing in order to get the win.`\you guys also cut a huge lead in half..`\Missed the start, did Zaza get the start? Where's CP? Or has there been an early sub`\guys chill i was just high lol. replied to the wrong guy. Lillard is my favorite non-spur`\TBF, we're on too.

I would credit GSW's defense/transition game the reason they're winning big. `\Klay is going bananas in the bay.`\GOOD CHRIST`\lillard needs to pull some tmac like action`\Haha doooope

Fuck the haters lol

Shocking assessment in this game.`\got burnt a bit on the PnR with Lillard, but superstars will do that to you, all good. great game by Val. He took us out of that slump when he came on late in the 4th.`\Kawhi stop plz sir`\THere's a j in there somewhere.`\Finally, refs giving us a call when a 76er mauls our guy on the rebound.`\Lillard fucked up making this "the most important game of his career" `\he gets back well too -after setting off of screens -and contests`\And he mostly had an impact when he was playing. The guy is solid and yeah he's fun to watch. Love his hustle..`\I think Mobile, Alabama?`\Okay, next quarter let's defend screens better and get rebounds. If we do that, we'll have a shot. We can't just keep doing the same.`\The Livingston shot? Hit him on the hip.`\Yessir`\Both teams 18/35 on threes`\I really love CoJo.

`\Is there anyone close to CJ for most improved so far?`\Be very afraid now!!`\And dont you forget about it`\Henderson tried to take "Raptor Killer" a little bit too seriously there.`\How many Thunder employees does it take to fix a basketball net?`\He's probably not even watching the game and just saying it based off reputation lol`\Yah the HD streams were lagging behind, the SD one is real time, the vipleague.SE one`\they cant even pay for it either`\Don't watch a Celtics stream or mute the sound.`\Hardee's better than In n Out?

BRIAN ROBERTS TAKEOVER INITIATED`\me too :(`\He also doesn't have LA pulling out opposing power forwards. He's making more difficult finishes then he has in the past, and it's beatiful!`\He was in his shooting motion before the whistle was called, so it should have counted. `\Serge finally remembered how to hit shots again!`\Don't we have him on a 2 year contract?....I swear we got him for a 2 year 6 mil deal`\Noah all alone under the basket!`\That intro sort of reminded me of Pinwheelempire's stuff. `\John Wall is wearing "He got game" 13's, expect big things`\Classic bench`\I can't take another last-second loss please`\And the answer?  None.`\We hit a three!!!!`\No doubt, I look away after we score and they've already scored.`\Release the KAMAN!!!`\why not start crabbe over harkless?

Edit: i take it back`\JJ!!!`\Fuck, Dirk can't miss. `\Yeah I'd like to see some more effort out of him. Not getting a triple double in the first half is unacceptable.`\He got fouled. Almost made it too`\No problem, I think there were only 2 bad raps fans in the whole thread, besides that, it was pretty fun hanging with you guys. See you in the championship ;)`\Shit, can't miss two in a row Hendo`\DAM3 TRILLARD! `\Only down by 11, not bad not bad`\CLUTCH JOHN WALL <3`\He definitely has a shot, just been cold tonight.`\The league's position would be that, since they know it is under review, they should play with the understanding that the review might not be in their favor.  The more I think about it, with less than 5 minutes, a difference of 1 point can change the types of shots a team will select.  In this case with things being so clear before the official review, it doesn't mater, but yea....  that could be really shitty on a close call.`\Well.... it was a kid soo...... yes /s`\This is the first time I'm going to say this... The refs were garbage I never like to blame games on refs but this.... wow
gg Toronto `\I feel like every single team scoring record has the late 80s/early 90s nuggets in it somewhere either on the good side or the bad side`\Varejao is playing as a passable Bogut sub. Would love to have Ezeli back but still`\You're right. I'm sorry man (not being sarcastic). Just frustrated `\I thought you wanted to tank...`\Hey look... another wild whistle appeared...`\Ain't have to throw the ball at him lmao`\What?`\Why would he? He's been ice cold all night.`\How many goddamn dribbles do you get for continuation? I thought it was fucking zero!`\Lol. Kaman totally whiffed on blocking the after the whistle shot`\I feel justified saying he should've come back earlier`\dame is so good im crying I wouldnt trade him for anyone even steph idc `\Why is a pregnant woman in the 3rd trimester sitting courtside? `\This is where we don't make CJ play point and use Brian Roberts. `\finally a fucking basket`\yeah you better make that one dame`\Oh shoot they won? I picked them too! Probably the only matchups I got right lol`\how did JT look?`\Shoulda gave it to the Chalupa Man.`\Where would the Raptors be without Lowry?`\teams stay picking on oubre`\Hack a plum. Please? `\And like every game so far this season, we will fail to do anything in the final possessions of the game.`\I'm here for the beating. Given, received, doesn't matter. `\SadStotts.jpg`\I mean, you almost forced a TO on us though.

It makes sense. You guys aren't going to be favored in OT, so you want to go for the win now move. Going for the steal is probably the best chance of winning.`\Well hopefully we can win in Detroit on Sunday and finish this road trip 4-2.  That'd be a great road trip.  `\Not the one I'm watching`\Lillard has really elevated his game this season. Awesome to see him taking that next step.`\*ugh* let's go mavs!`\SULLLLYYY`\New plan: trip Bradley `\YES REBOUND!`\there we go vonnie`\the pelicans have some pleasant announcers`\Never doubt the Raptors propensity to collapse!`\oh come on, this is what happens when we get bored`\Im talking about on defense you clown. Stotts took Dame out but left CJ in. CJ got ran off a screen and Redick got a wide open look.`\does plumlee have a dying tooth?
`\Every sport is big in New England.  But Celtics are in 4th right now, but once people see them as contenders they will easily surpass the bruins in popularity like was the case during the big 3`\The kid in the red jersey behind Iguodala was in amazement.`\that was all anybody talked about heading into this season. `\Blazers shooting higher % from 3 than wiz are on FTs `\Well then it appears that we're at a stalemate `\Feel like you gotta call something there, right?`\Damn my stream is messing up `\Oh man, lots of contact right now. `\He isn't what he used to be. He was a guy who played with relentless energy and effort but the injuries have sapped him of that to a degree. Still a smart team defender and that's what he can be for your team.`\annnd the slump continues.`\Don't get sloppy, Dubs.`\Knicks getting 4.5 points as of now. Anyone down for some /r/charitablebets action? I'll take $10-20 on the knicks against the spread. Loser donates to the winner's charity of choice.

Digital only bullshit. someone give me a stream`\> First things first: there is no shame in losing to the Raptors in Toronto.

man, i cant believe this is happening`\He is, but he's our garbage.`\dude if you and I commit to this we can combine to make one 12 foot double white guy.  I still am down for the make up though if you prefer.`\It's going alright. Wonky reffing on both sides. `\I hope he's okay Raptor fam`\BRIAN ROBERTS BLESSING US WITH GREATNESS`\sad`\Don't you fucking jinx it`\nothing but respect , fuck the blazers :)`\LOL`\What? Who am I pissing off?`\Barnes got burned. `\Recent history would suggest the answer is not in our favor. `\Crabbe's 3 was initially considered a 2, took forever to finally review it and add the extra point.`\Shots aren't falling at all, open or not. OKC is doing very well offensively but our rim has a lid tonight.`\Seriously. Once he's integrated into the system and in shape, he's a great back up for Bogut. `\You mean when they blow us out?`\How about sexual favors?`\God dame`\Only if you think a flying death machine is funny!`\BINGO`\Tape was the MVP of the game tonight. `\The refs are handing the 76ers the game right now`\nah they just replayed it right now. As an explanation of the call.`\Lol yea compare to JT he's a huge upgrade. I'm not questioning his ability to play the game (except those midrange pump fake that no one ever fall for), he just needs time to learn the rotations`\No communication between dame and the big man `\I ain't complaining tho `\ROBERTS SIGHTING

PREPARE YOUR BUTTS, WIZ`\Please Wes be okay. I'm glad he did that intentional foul. He looked like he was hurting. `\Think that was more of a 'oops, I blew my whistle, so I better make something up."`\Yeah like I said, it's not that he's a bad announcer or anything. I also probably wouldn't be as annoyed if we weren't getting rekt. lol`\How did Chris Paul get such an easy lane?  Jeez.  `\Coincidentally we are good at rebounding and making 3s`\That can't be right. That's brutal. If it's true I kind of regret taking them +6`\nah, it's a routine thing, not just against portland. `\Dam3!!!`\Definitely agree.`\MB: "Adams is fouled..he and his moustache will shoot two free throws"
 lol`\Mike and Mike saying they called it already, no basket.`\And this, kids, is why you never piss off Golden State.`\preach. agreed`\Come the fuck on. That's a kicked ball`\Looks like the Blazer down vote brigade is out in full force. `\wow contusion. so lucky.`\This is the cancer we've had to endure. `\CJ!!!!!!`\OOF.  Our defense is putrid so far`\Let's get revenge for the first game!`\Lowry is always clutch`\He definitely should. I remember at least two. `\It's about time!  `\IT Looks freakin great tonight`\vonleh. man what do you have going on in your head tonight.`\nice big to big`\Dame finally gets a call, and it's a heck of a baillout, too!`\I dig these philly jerseys`\C'mon Meyers. :/`\probably, and rightfully so`\Why is every NBA ref incompetent? `\Yes the blazers fan base is one single entity that has the same opinion on everything haha`\idk if it counts as a clutch shot if nobody is within 10 feet of him`\I'm sure this is because we've been on the road all month and we're exhausted, but we have to be more focused.`\Yeah! Now let's score!`\That's what happens when the refs blow the whistle every freaking time you contest a shot.`\MICKEY`\Na man, Calderon put his hand on the shooters hip. Can't do that`\Damn... Dame is so hot right now.`\And he works hard, it's why he's perpetually drenched in sweat`\Yeah Noah!`\Splash is back baby`\Yeah, he's more of a pick and pop player`\Wins HAVE to have an impact on MVP voting, so Harden is out. He has been a horrible leader of that team. He ONLY cares about stats.Edit - found the rockets fan!
`\Portland. There's more to Basketball than scoring.

You have to stop the other team scoring as well.`\Absolutely. But Lamarcus was better than Anderson, and many Blazers fans always trashed Lamarcus until about 3 years ago (and some more recently). It's just a weird dislike of "soft" stretch PFs. Same thing happened to Frye and even Sheed. `\������ Moe!`\I'm going with no `\varajao is adorable.`\Oh, don't worry, Mike & Mike are notorious for jinxing our games.`\6ers on the 26th, Kings on the 28th, both at home then you guys. We'll be well rested and hopefully riding some momentum after a couple of wins. Looking forward to that one .`\Just looks like the emphasis is on his armpit xD`\REEEEEEEEEEEE`\But... Lillard isn't playing right now.`\Boston is a hockey town first, make no mistake.
`\Dang. Good take. Needed a stop.`\I hope Brian Roberts can show off some stuff and get himself a little time in the rotation. He can score off the bench and hopefully help ease the burden on Dame and CJ. `\Varejao still has a lot of work to do. He has no idea where he should be on the floor. `\Just fuck me up fam - RIPCITY`\HERE WE GO DD, RECORD TIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIME`\These drummers have about as much rhythm as the Blazers' offense`\Well, he is shooting 7% worse at the rim this year over last, but he does look better doing it somehow.

[last year](http://on.nba.com/1JXQlO0)

[this year](http://on.nba.com/1WJOvaq)`\Calling it now, Russ and Dame both go for 40 and we get OT.  Not sure who wins though.

GL OKC`\He was a rotation guy on the Hornets. A scoring point guard off the bench would help ease some of the burden on CJ`\BRIAN ROBERTS TIME`\NOOOO SPEIGHTS`\Does passing not count as that ball movement though?`\is he ice col'?`\r/nbastreams`\Either way, really. Somebody's gonna have a broken heart after this one.`\Welp, need a miracle to win this one. `\I ain't even mad`\what a terrible call

sad`\Lillard with the matador D`\Okay, now keep the foot on the pedal.  I want to see the bench play the rest of the game.`\Damn Gerald`\I must have missed it, did they break the 3pt record?`\3 blazers knocked each other off that rebound

No, wait, that's not it. . . `\I think it's Kyrie Irving, first pick in 2011 (?) but was injured so he didn't play in the NCAA tournament with Duke.`\Fuckin' 'ell.

let's make this work`\no i want it`\More than me is my prediction. I sure hope I'm wrong though.`\Apparently he's a photographer now. `\Get rebounds!`\yeah but not tonight bro`\Love that Kerr smile.`\Are you kidding me?`\youve taken 20 more FTs`\No, I was joking too lol`\Damn I just realized Klay has 7 3's...

What if he breaks the record this game?

And Curry immediately ties it.`\I always believed in you PAT! `\I hope they call that dunk of the game.`\I pretty much feel like :( :) :( :) :( whenever Wes makes a shot against us`\The officials are who had the brain fart.  You can't foul if the clock runs out, and it should've.   `\Why did all the Portland guys just stop and let Curry lay it in? I'll never understand it, like they are following orders to not touch Curry?`\Probably will see some minor changes(assuming health). Mostly to depth but I can see Barnes asking for too much and he leaves(unlikely).`\Playing like garbage lately.  Let's see some damn effort.`\What happens if every player from both teams fouls out? Because that's where we're heading right now. `\Lillard is having an off night tonight. That has a lot to do with it. `\There's definitely 7-11's around here. There's one at a gas station maybe 5 min away from my house.`\Blazers shoulda kept mills instead of dame `\Why the fuck is Temple covering Lillard`\Just fire Ernie and Randy already plz.

That's dope.`\Klay doesn't care about your defense`\Holy shit. At least we have the last shot. `\Hendo! Woo!`\JT!`\he got straight up robbed`\mr bingo me oh my awaits on another stream`\It's tied and we're getting the last shot.

The only potential foul there was Aminu getting JV from behind, and I didn't see anything.`\>Ducks lost...

That made my Saturday haha

`\Even though you guys are silent, you've been pretty civil.

Kawhi, like GP, concedes lateral space in exchange of preventing drives, so he always stands between the ball and the basket.  Hip-to-hip is way more common and easier to execute.`\I also like winning.`\[THIS IS A NEW ERA BROTHERS!!](http://i2.wp.com/www.raptorscage.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Lowry-Dancing-GIF.gif?resize=397%2C223)`\Bledsoe was a Boston hero when the Pats were bad (Ben Coates, etc.)... but I was a little kid so tough to gauge the feel of the city. `\Aw, Hendo, SO CLOSE`\Salah! !`\Gotta hand it to the Blazers fans.

Holy balls`\You forgot to say 'away' again`\Henderson being a bitch`\i knew a kid from el salvador once.`\Dre pls be okay :( you just came back`\Gotta love it`\Roberts doesn't even have a TO?`\Damn Lillard`\i suppose you also never use superlatives`\Well when I said "might" I meant "is"`\100 with 5 mins left in the 3rd... damn`\bad shot keef bad shot`\Jesus christ that's a foul?`\Ha.  Copied & pasted from the thread start.  You are correct of course.`\Time to put in Lowry.`\Dammit Frazier...`\Good to have you back boys`\Ah, yes, the key matchup everyone saw coming - J.J. Barea vs Brian Roberts.  `\ankle breaker and almost made the shot!`\I keep forgetting Gary Neal is on the team, and when I do remember, I do not miss him at all.`\Keep that money!`\M3Y3R$!!!`\For a change, the refs send Lowry to the line.  `\Yeah we do, I just double checked`\That was goaltending on Curry's layup, right? It hit the backboard before CJ blocked it.`\Westbrook couldn't let Barnes be the only trip-dub this season without a turnover.`\Roberts!`\Top five clutch? Sure. Top five overall player? Nah. `\damn nabil gettin some`\Lillard time better come early or there's not going to be a 4th quarter. `\Strawberry surf rider from Jamba Juice is money`\This Blazers team is great. Much respect for climbing out of the funk you had earlier in the season.`\I would bet my life savings that it is.`\Live by the 3, Die by the 3.

We died really fucking hard`\They're missing March Madness!`\When I saw 0.9 there I thought it was going to be fate. Good game raps! That was fun as hell`\Damn, just can't stretch this lead out.  `\next year`\Damn, so close!`\my guess is he would still be a raw 20 year old named kelly oubre`\I think we could beat the spurs if we play our best ball over 7 games. Warriors if we play our best ball and they play way under average`\That's the dagger. Good game Dallas.`\He's just on the bench. Not dressed out`\Us too :-)

See you Saturday!`\The good thing about Lillard is he knows how to flop`\Welcome to the game, asshole.`\After this game, Dame's gonna apologize to the media for being upset about the comparisons.`\Klay done that so casually lmao `\Well, he was in the MLB draft. :)`\Cursed sports town in general. Watch the Caps lose in the first round this year`\Honestly, I have no idea. I'm not sure anyone knows what contracts will look like the next two years. Zach Lowe said even GMs are unsure what the market will be, because the cap hasn't jumped this drastically before. Teams may save their space for future years, or just blow it all on average players to stay competitive.

Most predictions I have seen say CJ will, but who knows. Hopefully it's less! (Note: his extension wouldn't kick in until the 2017-2018 season)`\They should at the very least split the minutes between Harris and Justin considering having three guards out there creates so many mismatches. I don't mind giving a bit of offense up for defense.`\Home cooking!`\bad call. Pelicans got a few calls but two wrongs don't make a right.`\Oh beautiful pass!`\yo CJ hella good`\Livin on the line. I'd be frustrated too in your shoes blazer fans`\Pretty brutal. Losses to the Clippers and Raptors were both by 2 points, and the Dallas loss was an in OT. It hasn't been a great stretch of play, but our schedule to close out the season is home heavy, so we should be fine. `\stay dead dame, use this for tom!`\HENDOOOOOOO! For real, the Blazers shouldn't have won that game with 20 or so turnovers. I'll take it though! In the words of Mark Mason, "DAAAAAAAAME DOLLA FROM I-5!!!"`\Charlie thinks he has Steph range `\it was always an uneasy coalition. we fight for the northwest side by side against dallas and houston, but thats where the alliance ends.`\I know I had no part in this, but I'd love to dedicate tonight's game to all of our stupid fans that think we are not even contenders and our season is over. Fuck you guys. `\Terrible officiating and neither team getting a rhythm aside, this is about as good as a bad game can get.`\Am I the only Knicks fans left on this thread?`\Mike & Mike can't math`\Crabb3!!!`\I love Ed's full court press on just about every inbound pass lol.`\That's your best argument? The Cavs? HAHAHAHA The Cavs are awful.

And what game was that again? Like the 20th game of the Season? Oh shit man yeah players really give a shit before the all star game, Not like Portland is trying to make the playoffs or anything, Not like they lost a game to the Clippers that they should have won.

You're just a dumb fuck homer fan who defends Portland even when they deserve some back lash (Like the rest of the Portland fans)`\i think you need to fix that link fam`\Do they keep track of real time records? Cause this might have been one of the longest halfs ever. `\Things are gettin' heated but man those Dallas jerseys with the skyline are dope as hell `\You're the type of fan who completely disappears when your team does poorly. `\Don't even care anymore`\Yeah Ed!`\Lillard has the "fuck this I'm winning this shit" mode.  Though we got one of those as well... `\fuck the ducks`\It's Austin Rivers Plumlee, no need to pass it. `\Man, how is there no rule that makes them review whether that was a three or a two in a really close game?`\Word, and Hark didn't even touch him that time`\What do you mean?`\A Raptor going to the FT line... what else is new? This game is taking so long. :\`\if we win this one we'll have 13 home games in a row..East Dubs :D `\1 free throw away sooo close. Also Lillard is a monster.`\doesn't feel like we're leading the game. no rest on this fucking team! energy is the same leading or not. god i love this team`\Mickey time`\ROBERTS?!`\Here. We. Go.`\MAKE A LAYUP JOHN`\http://imgur.com/aEWcSFR`\yeah first time I've heard him too... not exactly what I was expecting him to sound like. Kinda sounds like he lost his voice though.`\More like liz lemon, amirite`\FUCK DUDLEY TAKE THE SHOT WHY`\Lee is a beast off the offensive glass `\hope JV gets involved this game. This is the kind of game he should dominate`\Who the fuck feeds this beast named Jared Sullinger ffs man you're already undersized, have a bad foot and can't jump over a rug I mean at some point he has to understand that he needs to lose weight right?`\READ THE SIGN, TIM. We're cooking with TONY tonight.`\Powell!`\what happennning???`\did kerr just yell "lets go mo buckets"?`\Can he teach it to Stotts? Because he seems to have forgotten tonight.`\SMDH Fredette`\...the amount of food that doesn't end up in Mike Rice's trunk...`\careful /r/Mavericks might hear u`\KA3AN!!!`\YEAH WE CAN`\Would be interesting to see a Wall Sessions starting lineup `\i am entertained `\fresh out of the oven`\We were down 22-19 when I turned on my tv. I like to think they went on that run because of me.`\Davis can't be stopped!`\I still want to see more Cliff Alexander. Unsure why he never gets to suit up`\NO KLAY COME BACK IN YOU NEED TO MAKE 5 MORE THREES`\Probably Orlando @ Golden State 3/11/11: 36 Total 3's (21 GSW, 15 ORL)`\Our fast break/transition defense is atrocious.  `\Williams is a fucking machine`\SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO many fouls on both sides. REF stop pls`\damn jv eating`\Lillard is channeling his microwave badge`\Of course, the bench blows the lead. WTF is this.`\Well at least that's getting called both ways.`\Did we not already?`\Same as you remember him. Gives his all and always makes his team better. I still can't believe you guys didn't try to bring him back.`\We survived the wrath of a god today.. `\Ouch`\You . . . are not wrong.  `\Back door would have worked.`\THE PPATT`\If Nikola Vucevic was playing it could be a toss up cause we can't defend centers, but he's out. `\EJECTION? the fuck!? Did he hit him with his dick? `\you already do`\DIRK YOU ARE GOD`\[Slim reaping](https://streamable.com/gl4l)`\Shorter, maybe.`\These refs must be working on the second of a back to back because this is horrendous on both sides haha`\He says that on a lot of patty's 3s lol`\He's second in the league in techs but ok`\He is our starter so more like 30 lol?`\When our bigs are able to catch Westbrook's bullet passes we are unstoppable. `\The loss to Portland last season was actually the first loss in that teams demise.`\Shit, rim checked hard`\Yeah, I think you're right. `\No communication or what? Plumlee could have been helped with a heads up that saving it would start a break`\gone?`\There was a series of calls in the third that honestly completely shifted the tenor of the game back to us, even when you were playing well and we were playing like crap. They called everything tonight.`\so this is in no way a valid criticism of Detroit's announcers, but does anyone else get annoyed with the play-by-play guy constantly referring to making a shot as "filling it up"?`\Lillard for 70 in 2ot`\that's a silly thing to be homeriffic over`\I like the way you think.`\That was the plan the entire time!`\The paint is apparently an invisibility cloak.`\Turner.`\lol did that count?`\I just really hope we don't give up a 3 here.`\not as well as livingston unfortunately, he murdered our guards in the playoffs`\Okay, this is actually getting boring. I want to leave work but I don't want to miss the game`\Damn thats a strong take`\Is this not the time to play our rookies?
`\Oh my god it's still the 1st`\Good guy TD with the help up.`\We're hot too.

Just not GSW hot.`\this entire game has been so soft`\this made me laugh fucking hard lol`\have a feeling that the mavs are gonna miss their first look then get an offensive board for the win... hope thats not the case...`\Shoulda known better than to say something not completely positive about OKC in their post game thread. Y'all some salty insecure motherfuckers`\We're about to witness history`\Ed Davis free throw motions looks smooth, but he does something weird with his off hand that affects his spin. `\Can someone explain to me the celebrity row in MSG?`\Idk, i would still finish.

But each one with their own i guess.`\They're just trolling their sad pathetic lives away.`\Its hard to judge this part of his defense because its rare to see him in that spot and the team has terrific help defense.`\Warriors need 5 threes to tie NBA record in 4th quarter`\we also didn't turn the ball over and shot an amazing percentage.`\Just because he's good from the post doesn't mean I like it.

Would it kill the Knicks to run some P&R with him?`\Is Montero active tonight?  He's got some great potential--might as well give him some minutes in a blowout.  `\What's wrong w cj? Hand? Wrist? Finger?`\CTRL+F fresh_smelling_rip

fresh_smelling_Flair`\Y'know, it'd be nice if our bottom-of-the-bench players could score a little. `\The refs just swallowed their whistles in the second quarter compared the first.  It's not like they've called nothing in the second quarter - we've gotten a few calls.  And it's not like they've called that many on PDX.  It's that the game has become even more physical, but compared to the whistle-happy first quarter, the refs are silent.  It's the inconsistency that's the problem.  And it's playing into the Mavs physical defense.  `\Chill man, it's there now. `\I worked out how Dallas can upset the Warriors first round.

Take them to OT every game. 4-0 sweep.  Easy

I'm available if the sheeple FO decides to wake up and hire me as coach`\BIG SCIENCE BACKIN DOWN`\Once we take him back for our inevitable championship run.`\God we make some dumbass fouls sometimes`\Draymond Green probably would've fouled out by now.`\Oh, yeah definitely. Dude, I've wanted to longboard down keetonville for the longest time, but I haven't because I plan on seeing 23.

But yeah. I work at Lowe's across the railroad tracks. Have to leave my home 30-40 minutes early to make up for the damn train delays. `\Watch us lose. I already know the outcome. Born to lose.`\M3y3r$!!!`\Unstoppable caveman`\Do they normally give everyone green t-shirts on St. patricks day?`\hmm 151pts from warriors?`\^BIIIIIIIIIINGOOOOOOOO`\GET THE STOP BOYS!!!`\Mo has been passing (really well) lately.`\I have a feeling the blazers have had this one circled on the calendar.`\hope the refs have to rewatch that in slowmo all half time`\He's a legit 20/4/4 guy`\that might've been the softest drive i've seen all year meyers`\Wall, cmon. There were like 4 dudes there`\He is a good passer and runs the floor really well. Unfortunately, he is a bad interior defender and doesn't have much or a jumpshot or post game to speak of. He has really improved his free throw shooting which is great. If he can improve the other aspects of his game like that, then i can see him starting for us. `\Vonleh prolly wanted it`\What happened to him? He looked so good at the beginning of the year`\No! Hands off!`\you haven't really watched this game have you?`\This was a very entertaining game. GG Blazers.`\Lillard. McCollum. Lopez. Breen. Frazier.

Could this game be any more based?`\He seems to do well against Drummond`\Them not having Vucevic is really helping us. That dude kills us every single time we play them. `\Right!? Love dirk and love wes. But we really need this win.`\Any time we have a hint at a run they slam the door in our face. `\Well, it is Tony Brothers...don't know how he's still a ref`\You can't play us every game unfortunately haha`\That was a horrible double team.`\I really like this Magic squad but they are fucking dreadful. We are not even playing that good and still lead by 25ish.`\CHIEF!`\I really like these Portland announcers.

So chill!`\too many dookies `\Has anyone got a good stream? The ones on /r/nbastreams aren't great.`\Ugh, ugly shot by Aminu. `\We look like a highschool team rn`\Yes, please have a good shooting night Crabbe`\Anotha 1`\Portland's so tired. Just reaching everywhere.`\Are you fucking really blaming future losses on Lillard? Ok, if I throw up in the next few weeks it will be because you typed that fucking shit stain of a comment.`\Morris has played well`\was that a moving pick?  My stream made it hard to see`\As opposed to Portland? `\Did Tim Duncan just help Lillard up? God damn it, it's fucking impossible to dislike the Spurs.`\CLUTCH HENDO`\Varejao scared to shoot.`\THAT BLOCK/FOUL HNNGG`\time to double team lillard`\When did hendo kill the raptors?`\How did we get BDJ AND Tim Frazier on 10 days this year? Two good future bench players for nothing. That's gooooood. `\Gonna be one of those quarters for Klay.`\I want Pat to throw down a massive dunk. `\can we get a gif of harkless landing on that guy?`\My internal monologue is going
"bullshit ref"
"got away with one there"
"oh bullshit call"
"got away with one there though".

Don't know how to feel.`\ball don lie`\lmao Derozan 24/25 FT wtf`\Haha "Bad Blood" playing on the PA`\Terrible fade away, off ball offensive foul, made 3. All the stats see is 100 points per possession. `\They got the ball back?`\BINGOOOOOO`\Good lord, I'm not sure there's a player with a faster 0-60.`\Plumdog Thrillionaire!
`\All these screens be moving.`\I don't know about that, but 15 of Crabbe's 16 points are from the 3 ball.`\I picked UALR :P`\Why didnt you shoot Harkless?`\Wish Brian could get into the rotation. Take it with a grain of salt because he's only playing garbage minutes, but he can score`\Warriors fans- How well does Steph defend against guys posting him up?`\Meh`\if he does, it will definitely involve meyers leonard`\Lillard is a mean motherfucker. And it's not even the 4th yet..`\>Dame not shooting it well tonight

Me, 15 minutes ago.`\This dude has been trolling the whole thread.  Just ignore him.  I think he's got an obsessive little crush on Dame the way he keeps going on.`\Fucking NICE!`\Anderson started it a play earlier, then shoved Henderson again on the other end, then Henderson shoved him back, and then Anderson put his elbow all across Henderson's face. Their actions really weren't equivalent. `\Faiir bit of traffic around the rim, pretty energetic on the closeouts. But you're right we've gone cold in general on top of those things`\Not at all. Just a little shooting slump`\What's even funnier (or sadder) is Moda the company is basically going bankrupt haha`\Nobody said you were, stop with the victim complex.`\Dunno why you are getting downvoted. As someone who has watched every Clipper game this season, I was not counting on it going it. `\plumdog has had a really rough last 5 games or so`\That drumline is pretty cool

It looked like they passed it, so ball was live.`\this is a pretty fun idea actually.  What if the NBA allowed a certain number of games a season...say 20, where you could share rosters with a randomly selected team from the opposite conference.  A win would equal 1/2 a win on each teams record, but if you beat a combo team, you would get 2 wins.   this could be pretty interesting.`\Bruh you outta line lol`\Dray scores in the most ugliest ways`\Screens are generally illegal this game. `\We seem to get shutdown by perimeter defense every time.`\GG, super close game at the end `\sweet defense mr leonard`\fuck`\HEs IN the ZONE`\Might want to try to defend the perimeter at least a _little_ bit. `\Wall's been getting to the line a lot lately.

Then you can pout all you want.`\Best backcourt in league in the game! `\Look at this kid's posting history.  He tends to be a bitch in most game threads.

[Kaman over-the-shoulder and-1](https://streamable.com/fqho)`\Especially Kevin Love`\IT'S YOUR EGG MCMUFFIN, HENDERSON`\I really hope we can keep Biz next season!`\He about had the triple double before half, one rebound shy.`\You've got to be kidding me. `\I need a DeMar R.W.A Straight Outta Compton - Raptors With Attitude shirt `\I hope so.`\That Thunder offseason topic was a fucking joke.`\Wait, threes are worth 3 points, one more than twos? I'll just shoot those.`\It's a bold strategy, Terry. Let's see if it pays off.`\It looked like he was talking the ref to convince him he called it before they passed the ball`\Fought their way back? It's been close all game hasn't it?`\One of the most boring basketball game I have ever watched.`\Mike & Mike stream?`\vonleh back in the game! yesssss`\Trying to be informative and not annoying but it is Paddys day as Paddy is derived from the Irish, Pádraig while Patty is the diminutive of Patricia. Most Irish who hear Patty groan at the sound of it.`\I'm sorry I ever doubted you DeMar`\See, this is why we lose. I'm not mad, but this was a fucking pathetic end. This is also why IMO that "The Process" will not work. Look how far away we are from the Spurs and the Warriors. Do you think that either of those two teams would ever end a game like that?`\M3Y3R$ L3G3ND `\He's struggled for about half the season. I don't think he ever fully recovered from his calf injury from last season. Even his crossovers are sloppier.

He's had a handful of good games where he showed us 6th man. I think he's been improving overall, although slowly.

And he definitely has a habit of chucking early shots from deep. When he is on fire, he is unstoppable. But when he is not. Well.

Just not a style of play that I want. But it's something that doc seems to approve of.

Jamal is actually a really great facilitator, and can still drive for lay ups with the best of them.

`\Lol just realized Tony Brothers is reffing. Prepare for a salty game thread.`\hey, at least our end of bench guys might get some quality minutes `\Bad call man`\Let's not wish harm to an innocent Volvo.`\https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/2n7b1t/game_thread_portland_trail_blazers_93_boston/`\(V)!_!(V)`\O'Quinn is so slow, how did he not just put that straight in?`\Who you got Uconn's womens basketball team or the Sixers?`\I was just about to comment on that. It sounds more like he's on the verge of killing himself`\#NoFreeTacos`\The very same`\So this game is gonna take like 3 hours`\Oh fuck`\my oven mitt is too small :D`\DROPPING DIMES!!!`\well that's just clutch af`\Rosters, injury report and others coming soon!`\Oh man, I forgot about Waiters. As happy as I am we don;t have to deal with him on the floor, that's a real sad story, man.`\he threw dame down like a 5 day old chalupa `\Ibaka blocked Leonard if that was what you're talking about`\how could you be mo harkless`\Vonleh limping?`\Hope it isn't serious for Iggy.`\You should probably let it go`\Signs of life!`\Yay another OT game`\FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK`\PLAY MICKEY AT THE POINT, COACH!!`\Seriously, playing like Steph would net him another 10 points minimum.`\Just don't do us like you did Memphis earlier this year.`\Didn't really expect much from this game anyway, could've had the win if we hit our FTs, but what else is new. GG Blazers.`\Im so pissed at him and it probably wouldnt have made that much of a difference even if he stayed in the game.`\Very true`\Somehow it gets to 2 minutes and no one can miss a shot`\Most players choose teams based on money and role first. It is rare when players take a discount to sign with a team, and if they do, it's to sign with one of the top teams (Iggy w/warriors, West w/Spurs). Can you name an example of a player taking a discount and a smaller role to sign with a non-contender?

And again, I really hope the Blazers don't spend $45+ million on one position. That's not good cap management. `\Hopefully this has playoff atmosphere `\Which commentators?`\We need as many points as we can get with this lineup`\Yeah Ed!!! `\Hit him underneath pretty clearly.`\fucking ridiculous `\##FUCK`\Lol this guy `\It was on Moe, what I'm saying is that he didn't actually foul him. There was no contact.`\Impressive shot`\0-100`\Well... He got 50`\knicks fans booing the knicks is a decades-long tradition`\Pretty happy with that start. Now let's keep it going.`\GIVE THE BALL TO DEROZAN`\How do you feel about him now /u/mehberry? `\Mike Rice likes it curved a little rather than straight. His hat rims that it. `\Won't lie, dre just got away with one rofl.`\Lmao, I can assure you even the 6ers get tired on 4 game road trips with a back to back`\I'm real torn about whether or not I want to root for the Blazers. Such a likeable squad, but we're so close to them in the standings.`\Hard to believe this same Blazers team beat the GSW. Far from impressed by what I'm seeing`\17/17!!!!!!`\I want him too more than Curry tbh lol, not that i dont like Curry because i love the man, but i feel that Klay should have that record lol`\Who needs Beal when you have Garrett Temple?`\lmao some salty pelicans fan downvotes galore`\you losers only come out of the Celtics sub when the games are over, stay over there.`\Yep he did. THe earlier part of the replay had it. Good to go.`\"Did I do thaaat?"`\he probably doesn't live in the US.`\Need more of those easy buckets`\Lol we might have to get Kaman on the court`\Did Collison just say "fuck that shit"?`\Does Connaughton have any points?`\No. Idk maybe like a month?`\Brian Roberts looks like Jaleel White `\Bogut got like, 3 offensive rebounds there.`\How in the FUCK do you let Crawford shoot a three? jesus`\Two fouls in 1:15? Yeah, very fast...`\How long can 6 seconds take?`\Lillard chickened out on taking the backcourt heave. He's no Steph Curry.`\fuck i should hella go to that.`\**Rice**: "Washington's trying to help the Blazers. . ."

WE DON'T WANT YOUR HELP EVEN IF IT KILLS US WHICH IT WILL`\CJ taking some really ill advised shots`\Happy Birthday, Blaze.

It's always fun to see all the mascots here for Blaze's birthday. `\ball dont lie bish`\Dagger after dagger in the fourth. Whenever he pulled up, I just assumed it was going in. It was unreal. He's amazing.`\Bench gonna blow it `\[(\\/);,,,;(\\/)](http://i.imgur.com//h0FptYC.gif)

He hit it!!!`\Jesus christ. 5 3s.`\rice still  hates felton hah`\Oh god I'd have to leave her. `\Powell is doing a good job chasing McCollum around these screens`\He hit ball first and hit his head on the follow through. Isn't that not a foul?`\Do they usually mute out so much of the background noise (actual game) to emphasize the commentators a lot on NBATV`\That's not happening.`\Circuitboard got water in it`\yes`\I feel like Jared Sullinger would look better with a flat top`\��~How could you be so Harkless?~�� `\WESTBROOK HAD 3 MORE ASSIST BY HIMSELF THAN WE DID AS A TEAM

AS A TEAM`\##HOLY FUCK`\He finally missed`\Foul was pre-shot, no points.`\No offense Blazers fans but your commentators are homer as fuck `\WHERE WAS THAT (non) MOVING SCREEN CALL? CALL IT BOTH WAYS ASS REFS`\I thought I was in Denver for a second.`\Well, looks like this wasn't a bad game for me to miss. `\I think Portland fans are definitely the second loudest supporters of Seattle getting a team back behind actual Sonics fans, but this dude apparently bet a bunch on the spread tonight and got salty and has been talking shit non stop. `\Warriors going to reenact the all star game on the scoreboard`\Don't let this go into overtime`\If so, my bad. `\[The man with the magic hands is fouled](https://streamable.com/u2mp)`\gg Portland Lillards`\Curry channeling his inner yam`\Damn Rivers... Must be the shoes...`\LILLARD TIME!`\We could've had this game if we just made our FUCKING FREE THROWS.`\omg, Westbrook fucked it up.`\Hopefully the magic can find a little heart tonight`\They hold the record in this season for most points in a half with 83.`\Lillarddddddddddddd!!!!

... and then WALLLLLLLLLLL!!!!`\am i tripping, wasnt it 117-115`\Steph: "I am your OG and I will be respected as such."`\Lauren Holtcamp is at the review center...NO!`\Probably could have been. Never made it past the first season though...`\I think they'll accept that tradeoff lol`\Meyers couldn't go the whole game without a brain fart. `\We gonna go b2b, we'll need to put him in if its not competitive by the fourth.`\dont take the cookies out of the oven yet, this aint over`\Ah, Rice.  He thinks "Born in the USA" is called "America, America."  That's our drunk Uncle Rice.`\I can never tell if I like the Pel's announcers. At first I don't like them, but then they grow on me, but then the "It's so and so..." for every shot starts to annoy me a little, but after a while they just lull me into not minding them at all.`\Fuck Aminu. Fucking stop`\I HATE aminu shooting that 3`\Iguodala - the working class man's human highlight reel`\after the tobias trade i was so excited to never see shabazz on the court again :(`\100 with over 5 mins left in the 3rd.`\Raps gonna need to tame the Dame to win this one`\The game hasn't ended yet...`\And then Curry goes back in leading by 21...`\Klay lmfao`\CJ!`\Oh boy, dis bout to get ugly`\I think part of that is when it is absolutely needed he consciously focuses harder. Which makes sense in late game situations.

I think its important for him because his shot is very textbook and not really as fluid as curry's(who can adjust very well no matter his balance).

It's my theory for why he is inconsistent considering how good he is.



`\What is this game?`\Some fans might live 2 and a half hours away in Claremore like me.`\Oh dang. Plums can make em`\FINALLY A FUCKING BUCKET`\Please Salah for the rest of the game`\It's just that Raps game distorting your perception.`\Seems like 70/30 in favor when it comes up.`\loving the Mike & Mike banter`\I do not understand how to get to the comment page...`\I think the Spurs are the worst option. We could probably win one against the Warriors, maybe two or three against the Thunder and Clippers. Spurs will sweep us though.`\Kawhi has been making more and more ridiculous one-handed shots.`\Is Rambis still talking about the playoffs?`\just wait for that 4th quarter collapse ffrom OKC, just hang tight Blazers!`\Damn Damian!`\Well he's still a year away from being 2 years away so really he's ahead of schedule `\And I love it. There's so much hate, that I just bask and embrace in it, each and every night.`\lillard go for 81 lmao`\Yeah. Been here for a few years now. He's fantastic. Hope he never retires. `\Did derozan miss that on purpose? Seems like a smart idea if he did

`\Pass the damn ball McCollum, you pulled a double off the screen and threw up junk. Leonard was waiting. `\SPECIAL ED`\Sometimes Dame just astounds the fuck out of me.`\Hello, his name is Dam3`\>  Your team has no future

aww, are you trying to hurt my feelings? `\i know, i have to watch myself or it gets bad. he just really fucking annoys me. for what it's worth, i didn't bust on him once tonight!`\Kawhi fucking leonard`\Worst defence I have ever seen. That is literally the only thing they could have done. `\Davis!!`\Varejao sets up some sick screens`\PLUMDOG`\Fuck mejri`\Singler's hair doesn't look like it's attached properly to his head`\Rice just called Boston "Ohio State."

Drunk + tired is a bad combination.  `\Looks like Parsons is out and Wes and Deron Williams will be playing through (minor?) injuries... hm...`\if you wanna complain all game gtfo here`\Salah with the accelerated slam`\Gerald is missing a ton of shots.`\I want Dame to get a tech this game. He never gets openly pissed but damn he deserves to be right now`\What is Parker's career high assist total? He has at least 16 right now`\As a Canadian transplant to Portland, this is the best game I could have asked for besides the Blazers winning. 50 points from Dame, and DeRozan had an incredible performance. We are already guaranteed .500 on this road trip, and I was hoping for 2 wins at most tbh. GG raptors, beat the Cavs pls.`\Are you kidding? We'd be lucky to win one game.`\mario bricks`\blazers have lost a little bit of their pep`\He was awesome the year we got him and has slowly declined since. Obviously his shot is basically broken now for some reason. But lots of fans cling on to what he used to be able to do I guess. Its a shame cause he cares a lot and is such a good guy`\Patiently waiting for this Myers Leonard GQ cover`\dray is a beast `\If I were Crabbe I'd leave in the offseason. How does he not even touch the ball down the stretch having a career night? Instead we got to watch Dame throw up shit and turn it over. `\Damn, Kanter is going to give us problems`\What? Who on this team doesn't have killer instinct? That's absurd. There is no reason outside of drive that this team is anywhere close to the playoffs.`\The fuck. Phil Steve boring??

Also happy to see Powell producing with the minutes he was given!`\whats the consensus on brothers grimsby? `\Fuck next year. Let's play 7 more games this year.`\How did we not take the last shot? Why did Terry not call a timeout when Davis got the inbound and was stuck with 9 seconds? Why was CJ McCollum in the game on that last possession when Gerald Henderson exists? GREAT COACHING BUD.`\Jesus. almost 85% from the 3 point line. We miss you Wes`\But does he miss Hooper? `\can't tell if game really long, or i am really stoned`\He reacted to Brad yelling foul. And in the replay, he was in a shooting motion when the whistle blew. It's when the whistle blows, not when the foul happens. Refs fucked up. `\Pretty good considering the woman's team made it :)`\I've always hated Perkins, he's been been a douche his whole career. `\if dame isnt getting that call you sure as hell arent jj`\Players only heard whistles tonight.`\curry playing 1v5`\And make another one hate you `\Terps as well.

He was an injury replacement.`\Our rebounding is on point right now.`\I'd agree. He was so great after the break.

I'd love to see us rest him for the last 3 games if we clinch`\Hendo!!!!`\It was.`\So, yeah, fuck Jamal Crawford...`\Yeah, the 3rd quarter collapse is in full effect.

No argument there`\This is our 8th game on the road in 10 games--had a 6 game road trip then one game at home, then at GS, then at home against Orlando, now starting a four game road trip in OKC.

Haha. You complained about a foul like 2 minutes before this.

`\It's reminding a lot (just in terms of foul count) to our first game against the Suns in Phoenix.  It was the second game of the season and I think everyone had at least 4 fouls by the end of the game.  `\3J!!!`\Wild water kingdom ? `\76ers shooting 4/21 from three. Going for quantity over quality. `\48 and 35 FT attempts. What a joke by the Refs. Shame they just couldn't let the teams play.`\Exactly.

I don't understand how some fans still refuse to wrap their heads around it.`\these whistles are utterly baffling`\It was ball and arm according the Sean Elliott on the Spur's broadcast.  `\"Let's go russellllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllll" *bricks free throw*`\Defend what? He got what he deserved. Ejected.

It happened fast. And Perk went for the hard foul and nearly took Lillard's head off. Irresponsible of him. But he ain't Quicksilver.

Im scared every time he touches the ball`\yeaaahhhh I'm gonna go ahead and say that didn't happen`\Dude I'm telling you--the refs are now giving us the 50/50 calls every since you took that 20 point lead.  You have nothing to worry about you'll step on our throats soon.  `\timely three`\This team reminds me of a college team, a group of friends out to prove something. It makes for beautiful basketball`\It has been a long time since I've seen us miss shots like this`\Wtf? How?`\More open 3s please. God damn, Dallas.`\We lost`\OH FUCK`\beautiful passing`\nice edit`\Few things make me more sad than watching Wes limp off the floor :/`\Id rather beat the shit out of them and have them beat the shit out of us than lose two close ones.`\because it should be a 45 minute flight to seattle not a 5 hour flight :(`\Hendo going into Hobe mode`\just hack the fuck outta him instead of easy layups goddamn`\that was almost a guaranteed miss there

**Rice:** "I did."

**MB:** "Really?"

**Rice:** "Oh, that was in Boston."

Classic.

**Edit:** Toronto buds, let me assure you, I have no trouble believing that there are 7-11s in Toronto.  This is more a comment on the illustrious Mike Rice and his drunken, senile brilliance as a broadcaster.  `\oh shit...this is going to be a good one.`\This is a weird and pretty lame game but I like you DC fans`\Crabbe has good shot selection. Henderson does the long-2 fadeaway game, like DeRozan.`\Release the KAMAN!!!`\Refs are going ham tonight Jesus `\[I got you fam](https://imgur.com/55MWqhs)`\68-100. SKYFUCKER 007`\Shit this game has been boring as fuck so far`\Lmfao.

I actually have tears in my eyes at how bad that call was.`\The whistle is irrelevant, the actual timing of the foul is what matters.`\get in line`\original, but weird since he's torched Lowry all night`\Called it. `\BINGOOOOOOOOOOOOOO`\Hey, uh, so what happened to the comments here. . .

Edit: And two hours later, it's resolved.  `\GS gets some of the most serendipitous bounces I have ever seen.`\I knew the Rockets rabble rousing trolls couldn't stay away for long.  `\Don't give me that false comeback shit.

You should try that.`\[I am ready.](http://i.imgur.com/R8yWcEC.jpg)`\Yup. Sounded like they went off of when the foul occurred and not when the whistle blew.`\Fits right into the rest of the dudes, then. Just one o' tha (blind) boyz!`\What the hell am I watching`\Did I say that? I said Blazers have backed off because everything's a foul. AC had three fouls *in the first quarter*. Better to back off than foul out.`\Terrence Ross is hittin that`\Nice home cooking call for the Pelicans.  It happens. `\yup going to bed, and by that i mean deathbed`\Harkless is a magician along the baseline`\Boston is a pretty solid team and this is our 4th game in 5 nights on the road`\Charlie V over powell? I get you are trying to create that space but fuck it, I would rather have Powell shoot a 3.`\It's bench time. Nothing to lose, if they manage to make up the deficit we can switch the starters back in after a breather.

She's such a shit ref `\Can we bring baack Dame please?`\Sounds like us. `\The energy defensively is there tonight. It's pretty obvious it was a point of emphasis.`\We gonna fuck the sky, comin' in the spot lookin' extra fly. `\Shots aren't always going to fall. Good thing he's playing good defense.`\Misread that sorry; how many players do you envision getting the estimated 4yr/108m or 5yr/147m (bird) max this offseason. People seem to be throwing around everyone's getting a max but I find it hard to believe that McCollum is going to comand over a 9 digit contract`\So the new drill is working huh`\You mean you don't like watching him miss layups?`\I've said that a lot, but it usually wasn't a compliment.`\Why do the Warrior's blow so many leads?`\Are you the girl talking about icebergs?`\The Lithuanian Draymond Green when it comes to screaming.`\IT with 19 at the half.`\Blame plumlee`\fucking lillard is so clutch`\> Draymond is 9-9 from free throw.

Try again, bud.`\Well the ball wasn't "in the air"`\Stotts hates everything`\man it's been Lowry time all damn game`\Shoe rant!!!`\!`\it's on KGW this week`\You moron. Watch the game. This game is literally 6 fouls away from breaking the record for most fouls in an NBA game and there is an entire quarter left to play. Just... shut the fuck up.`\GG GL HF`\CP3 hit his knee or his calf?`\HENDO!!!! SOARING THROUGH THE AIR!!!`\[He has a player option](http://hoopshype.com/salaries/toronto_raptors/). He's definitely going to opt-out because he's about to get paid.`\Yes, I know, we were all worried about it.  But I don't think anyone predicted it would be this bad before the game - bad enough to dump the bench so early in the 4th quarter.  `\Good thing he's only got a few more seasons left in him. Enjoy this moment while it lasts; )`\That screen by Biyombo was so illegal lmao `\And then hate you when you left us`\ED DAVIS YOU BEAUTIFUL MOTHERFUCKER`\The daily Klay Thompson "fuck you" shot. That was such a bad shot choice but he still got it.`\told u 3rd quarter is our fuck up quarter`\40pts
`\Every nba crowd booes opposing free throws. What the hell are you talking about?`\Game ain't over, if any team can put up lots of points in a hurry it's Portland.

`\Booing players who take the right shots because the management has sucked is being stupid fans. Chanting for Jimmer to play is being stupid fans. Making your stadium a shitty place to play is being stupid fans.  `\Oh my god. Iggy wtf`\You didn't notice them already full in effect?`\lmao steph wht was tht`\Gimme some Moe!`\Hobe!`\Everyone is bricking lol`\sick burn`\Was wondering why so many fouls are getting called

If he's got the ball for any more than 0.5 seconds he's not good.`\I'm very worried about the 3rd quarter.`\Lol! Carm's dunk`\not going to call anything in the paint eh`\You wish...`\0.9!!!`\Yeah CJ!`\It's almost a religious experience. I went to college in Portland and was lucky enough to be at the game where B. Roy destroyed the Mavericks during the playoffs. It was amazing but it didn't even come close to seeing the Warriors win a playoff game at Oracle. If you have the means, get there. Even if you hate the Warriors. That building is alive. `\If Dray had just a little more air under his shot it would probably drop more often. He shoots an extremely flat angle.`\Dude he hacked him right on the arm in front of the ref. It as a straightforward call. Wasn't a bailout or touch foul.`\FUCK`\Jesus christ Kawhi fucked up Lillard there with that block`\There are TONS of 7-11s here`\Seriously, he was offended at being compared to an all-time great? Lillard is a cocky little shit.`\Lillard you should know better than to give steph space `\u go to the line. u go to the line. errbody goes to the line except blazers`\I understand our guards aren't the best at getting through screens, but at some point you have to swallow your pride and make someone else beat you. I'd rather we lose because Williams and Barea made plays than lose because Dirk was able to shoot the same shot he's been making for years over and over again. `\Do you mind donating some money to New Orleans to help with the funding?`\I bet you have to audition.

Someone gets paid to hold auditions for the show.

What a weird job that would be.`\er...i've never been to Taco Bell`\I miss you, Rebecca Haarlow. I got my picture taken with her.

Sounds about right.`\Dude, yes, i think you're right. Fuck yeah man`\Huh.  So that's what happens when Klay and Steph are hot at the same time.  Good to know.`\plumdog in hickson rebounding mode`\How did McAdoo get a tech?`\Yeah your deltoid muscle is in the shoulder and the deltoid ligament is in your ankle for future reference`\Yay our point`\How do you stop Dame?

But no, really, I love MB and Drunk Uncle Rice.`\This is why I love Wes but man, playing on an obviously sore leg is really risky after what he went through last year`\win win win no matter what`\What did the handerson say to the face?`\I think the context was important. This foul was in retaliation for an earlier illegal screen by Jason Smith. And you're up 20.`\Nooo Iggy! :(`\To be perfectly fair, shouldn't a coffin require a good amount of nails?

Whiteside probably won't either, but Lillard needs at least one other star before this team can contend.`\Crabb3!!!`\ Man I love Tobias`\oh fuck I forgot he plays for Portland`\Then homeboy brings out a puppy that does tricks. He knows what he's doing.`\DAM3 TRILLARD! `\100 points already.`\He was a free agent and probably nothing was more attractive than playing for the contender with like 5 former teammates, a brazilian national team teammate, and minutes with his name on em.`\pretty good thanks for askin fam`\As a Celtics fan, I hope Dallas loses :D

We just play super physical, gotta deal with it. `\lol, Plumlee. Didn't matter I guess, but still boneheaded move.`\Where the fuck is the point?`\i really dont like that iso 3 when a two would do`\nope its just meyers, Davis is actually a pretty mobile defender`\Yeah I hope we don't play OKC in the playoffs.  Not a fan of their style of play, if we're going to lose lets lose to the eventual champs in GS.  `\That's a fair point, usually the race is locked up.  The actual election always goes blue so it feels like not much attention is paid then.`\Yo where's the fucking foul on that?`\See you in the WCF`\Cause DeMar is only behind Harden at drawing fouls. `\LOL`\If this Reddit thread wasn't here I probably would have stopped watching this game. `\Form a fucking wall`\All these 3s, kind of boring no?

edit: Lol, opinons`\It's so rare to see Klay hot all game. Nice!`\Glad to hear. Hope he progresses nicely.`\set the record and then miss the 2nd?`\Vonleh has shown some serious potential.

`\Dirk dad dicking everybody today`\If the refs were any kind of consistent Aminu should have had an and-1 on his last drive`\why not? plenty of time left to play. Your team has come back down 20 in less than a span of 2min.. come on dawg

edit: i also want to get it sorted that im not agreeing with you that he "dove into him"... he went for a loose ball. You'd be applauding your guy if he did the same and caused no injury.`\all we do is THROW`\For real. `\I guess I jumped the gun. When does Lillard Time usually start?`\Curry 18

I knew all that hype about them would come crumbling down`\three offensive tips on the other end, and a block on the other `\I wonder what would have happened if the Hawks had kept him.`\Harkless with no run.   I really wish our coach would go to him more.`\We didn't score after CJ went out.

Might need to play them together more stotts. Bring out brian roberts and let them play minutes together`\Yes. Amber Rose's pussy gave him great basketball skills.`\Can't give us easy and 1's like that`\I should clarify, I meant in this game. I know he is a great shooting for a 7-footer. `\CHI3F!!! `\Klay on pace for the three point record in a game. `\I love it when ED Davis rebounds!!! `\Yea Dirks garbage `\I love how no one trusts Afflalo anymore.

It's amazing Curry is the best ATM and not even top 20 FTA, while the player with the 2nd most points needed nearly 1/3 to come from the charity line.`\Tony parker effect `\is the 24 consecutive still a record though?`\ball still don't lie `\you both saw the best backcourt match up of the season.

flair up champ`\GET EVEN CLOSER PLS`\MY WATCH SAYS IT'S LILLARD TIME`\Mo has been passing (really well) lately.`\The energy at the game was awesome, I really have to say that every 3 that McCollum or Lillard sunk just sapped the crowd. There was really no stopping Lillard, every time he had the ball it was almost a guarantee it was going in. Demar went off on the ft line though, so as arguable as the calls were, his efficiency has to be admired. `\Wall did not want to shoot there. `\God bless Portland. `\JVs scream is so sexy


Jk but it's hilarious. `\Big money!`\Blakey!`\Kyle "Steph Curry" O'Quinn`\Welp, that's probably the worst defense I've seen all season.`\Dame's only 38% three point shooting? I always thought it was much higher!`\21/21 at the line

Have another big game!`\16 fouls so far`\Are you seriously having a meltdown over 76rs? Before the game even ends? Really?`\Splash`\GSW are like Doomsday. You kill them and they come back stronger.

Jesus I know it's March but we still gotta rep it a little bit. `\It's fun watching the moving screens that were called in the first three quarters be no-calls right now.

Seems like they've been talking about it all month, what with the tourney and all.`\Yes, badly.  `\DAME TAKE MY ENERGY`\Why does CJ always have a million dollar move with a ten cent finish every game?`\We need Whiteside :) `\In general, not necessarily today`\Bench dumped halfway through the fourth quarter.  I am sad that this is what I expected all the way back at the end of the second quarter. `\He had a sick dribble drive and kick out to an open Harkless who passed it to Vonleh who air-balled a 3.`\Vonlayy lmao`\Thanks dude!  I got one!

On two bad ankles to boot!`\This is gonna be a good game. `\He was talking to the ref`\you act like you've watched every W's game.

Just enjoy that the Blazers are playing above expectations.`\I dunno man, there's a reason why people call Green a glue guy.`\This was bg but now i must say it has become gg`\These Portland hippies have their home goggles on. `\GREAT MOVE PLUMLEE`\Look at that Parker ballhog his way to 16 assists. /s`\STOP MISSING YOUR FUCKING LAYUPS`\It's not a bad strategy, under a second it's basically impossible to rebound and shoot `\When you try fight fire with fire...`\The arm to the face is what did it.`\Guess that makes up for him trucking Plumlee on a good screen. That Salah guy is garbage.`\That's really not true though, Harris has been very solid defensively this season. Being young and athletic is literally the only thing Anderson does better than Harris.

Im not saying JA shouldn't get PT but he's not the best option off the bench either`\It's pretty hard for a big to defend the P&R when the two guards who are usually getting screened are arguably the two worst starting guards in the NBA defensively (Lillard & McCollum)`\wtf Westbrook. Absolutely no reason for that foul other than to complain.`\Clearly? Nah. Maybe, the whistle happened while dame had the ball on his fingertips `\He wasnt trying to contest it, patty ran into him`\Lol Pop "What were you doing? Huh?

Just pass it kawhi for fucks sake! `\Jesus derozan is a machine tonight `\If the Refs are going to make us watch this shit show, it might as well be a historic shitshow. `\I guess I'll have to be ok with that half.`\D Will is going into the zone that he goes into 2 times a season. `\this is crazy. can't believe i missed this first half of all first halves `\It's more of a meme than anything I think. He's inconsistent and doesn't trust himself to shoot shots he should be shooting. `\Huge game.`\blocked it right off IT..`\Lol why was he flopping after fouling Lowry

Edit : salty Portland fans down voting... `\Hah, Fitz is keepin' it real about Lillard deserving to be an all star.`\Downvote if you must. Dame made the shot on the ghost offensive foul call on Mason so it was a possible 3 point play in the last few minutes. This one only gave us two back.`\lol you actually think we would match?`\Was gonna ask, anybody else get flashbacks watching that game? Flipped over when the Blazer game was over just in time to catch Wes hit the floor.`\Mavs doing real good pressuring our guards on the perimeter. Refs swallowing the whistle after that long ass first quarter `\Yeah now they'll start giving us the calls after we're down 20.  Happens all the time to teams in blow outs.

I doubt parks like Sea World or Six Flags care much about the population of the Metro area. Sea World was actually built a few miles outside the city limits, but since the city keeps expanding, it's now part of the city limits. Keep in mind that it was built in the 80's, and back then, all the parks were open all year, which probably played a part in the decision to put it down south. It's probably more expensive to maintain a park with marine animals when you are in the colder parts of the country.

I like their current usage of him. Vs teams where he can abuse his matchup they get him a lot of looks. In other situations both he and the team seem happy to not force it.

Thankfully he's become much better integrated into the Spurs offense and looks more confident and taking shots in the flow.

There's definitely interesting pieces in Portland with that dynamic backcourt. Lot of great ball movement and open looks (they need a SF that can make them though). McCollum is balling today. They just need to get more consistent on defense and trade for/draft/develop some more capable frontcourt players.

The losing team always jacks up a shot.  Who cares...`\I've been saying this all day. The reason the Celtics can hang with any team is because of how point guard-centric the league is.

But their defensive styles are just different. Pippen was an absolute ballhawk while Kawhi is incredible off the ball and denying you good looks.

I don't think other comparable usage players have shown that statistically.

His passing is coming along this year. It's pretty self evident as we watch the games, so cant complain on that one. If you double him, he throws it out and they get an open shot through ball movement. His development has been awesome to see, as that is an added feature to his game this season.

I'm big on diversity, the Raps need to utilize the front court more, and that starts and ends with JV. Per 36 he was around the same as Powell in FGA last time I checked a few weeks back lol, which is weird. Dame not having that type of support was one of the differences this game.`\What is with all these missed layups lately?`\In contrast, in the game against the Warriors, we already had more than 50 points at this point in the game`\Unfuckingbelievable `\Chief is so off now. Too anxious.`\come on barnes.`\Hendo is quickly becoming one of my favs`\Touché. I know it's a pointless "what if" argument, but my curiosity will never let me stop comparing him to THJ. Only time will tell.`\Crabb3!!!`\Fuck I love Norm more then Bruno. YAH I SAID IT, FIGHT ME.`\3J!!!`\this is the most lit stadium ive ever had the pleasure of watching LOL`\PHYS ED`\##Expected Starters

##Officials

Monty McCutchen

Gediminas Petraitis

Kevin Scott`\The score was 13-9 with 6 minutes left. Now it's 40-27.`\Love how quick Rick called time out. Doesn't want Dam3 getting hot`\Good Hustle Aminu!!!!`\im proud of him if (as i strongly believe) he intentionally bricked it. imagine him getting his own little record and letting dame score a 3 and go to OT and lose lol. team over stats`\dropped that 3 like a dookie after taco bell's more regrettable menu`\I'm just joshing, as those fans were as well. Keeping it like. Y'all seem revved up tonight.`\well there's this talk about KD coming to the Warriors...`\fuck again`\Lmao get that shit outta here that's petty af.`\Knicks played really good for like 10 days earlier in the season.  Anyone remember that? Me neither.`\Pretty sure we went to the same high school (or lived in the same city, idk)`\> Embedded in page
henderson throws an elbow, it shouldn't have mattered if it was to the head or not, he swung and got to stay in the game. you should be happy he got away with that garbage`\GG`\Keep passing that rock AFA`\I expected this when we blew them up in Portland but I wouldn't change a thing.`\HAHAHA HOLY SHIT THAT WAS A SWEET OOP`\Shit fuck`\Nice to see those two make it up.`\Damn iggy you gotta make that`\I am pretty sure a shitty game had a score like this this season. I want to say it was a nets game.`\Phys Ed is still the worst "we didn't even really try" nickname.`\RANGE`\RemindMe! 3 hours



I will call you out on this, sir. He better score no less than 82 or man you are gonna be so embarrassed by an anonymous redditor's comment telling you you're wrong. Buckle up!`\Steph on a MISSION`\You are thinking of Druncle Rice. Mike Barrett is actually a pretty good play by play guy`\Fucking hell I love desperation hustle plays`\I DON'T WANT TO BE BAD AGAIN`\Who the fuck is saying It's the refs?

We certainly aren't getting favored, but it's just fatigue.

We're tired
`\Dont underestimate our incompetence `\KING CRABBE`\some where in miami DJ khaled is making a snapchat`\LMAOOOOO`\Soooo... tank for Ben Simmons?`\When you get fouls like he did in the 2nd Q I don't blame him for playing shitty. What can you do?

Not to blame fouls entirely on this. Toronto is a good team. Just unfortunate it had to be poorly officiated and for Portland to lose even behind 50 from Dame.`\Sucks to see a loss but shit playing on the road against another great back court and a team that could possibly be in the Finals from the east. Yeah I'll take it. As a Blazer fan even with the loss oh the future looks so wonderful. `\1/8 from the line, keep hacking DJ`\"But we need to know *exactly what* he called his mother." - the refs`\maybe, I never saw that comment so I'm not sure`\Lol one call`\Nice spin JV`\PATT3`\Backstabber! What happened to yesterday's alliance?!`\##ANOTHA ONE`\muh heart`\We played a mirror game to this last season but lost and it sunk our season. Very happy about this game. `\If the bench defense isn't getting stops I'm glad they're matching bucket for bucket `\lmao damn you get a T`\refs trying to even out a fucked 3rd quarter?`\Can we sit Damian since we have to play tomorrow please?  `\Sounds familiar......`\Earlier in the season he signed a deal with adidas. The change in shoe gave him tendonitis in his foot. Eventually that led to knee problems and he had to have surgery. He's practicing and looking good apparently. My totally wild out of no where guess is 2-3 weeks still.`\It's nothing, it's actually impossible to dislike him.`\Whose jersey is he wearing? wth`\We borrow Dirk for home games`\Demar's wife is annoying af.`\LOOOOL`\Awww 40 pts quarter. I miss this. `\Woo! `\Curry is the karate kid apparently.`\Wow alright, good game Blazers `\I like yours too`\I have so much Respect for Lillard that I was already throwing my remote when he released that ball`\Surprised he didn't shoot that`\Okay, now can we just don't blow the lead in the 3rd like we did in past few weeks?`\Dame 5-5 then 0-8. Ugh`\Kellyyyyy noooooooooo`\����`\This thread is dead, damn. `\We need a guy like Whiteside but with the brain of an adult.`\clips look bored out there`\homie you're still high they're talking about a different poster. :P`\Yeah, the required 3s per game needle is moving fast right now. He could have a couple slow games and end up needing 6-6.5 3s to get there or he could get hot for a couple games and end up only needing 3.5 for the last 10-12 games.`\lol meyers thought someone was behind him`\Like hockey!`\That actually sounds fun`\Today: The day where Afflalo and Calderon died on defense.`\Even OP was sure that DeMar was gonna make the FT.`\Because a person has to start the clock, and they don't want the home clock operator to give someone a bit extra time`\I feel like you haven't actually watched him if you're saying that. You're own announcers were even talking about his shooting.`\jesus christ dumb turnovers`\I love cory`\FUCK IT LETS GO FOR 75`\not nba but I have a weird thing for Suzy Kolber`\Did anyone see Draymond start crawling on the bench??`\Rough gane`\Aren't they giving away Celebi in Omega Ruby through Mystery Gift?`\Until Dion is back unfortunately `\WAM lillard 3`\Nice job bench. `\Wes :[`\Do people actually use that papa murphey's thing? `\I'm still not used to having a bench that's entertaining as hell and also experienced `\FUCK ME! what a game, always love beating Portland; only because I love them so much.

Great game Portland, love your city, love your team. Keep giving them hell out west`\Watching the play by play and very confused by what the hell is happening right now. Blazers completely melting down?`\Wut!!?`\Rebound`\He's giving up so many offensive boards `\John Wall is such a great basketball player`\We both have a Garden also`\Thread getting salty I like it `\I was rapidly googling to see if Gordon had indeed been traded...`\That was a good rally, but it came a bit late.

GG Raps for a very aggressive game.`\Curry going for 100 tonight. Welcome home, Damian!`\ed davis needs to start `\LOL. Sorry I just tuned in. `\Curry, Lillard and Klay would be part of the few players that would benefit from a 4 pt line. Just the rich getting richer. `\why was he even out there after getting hurt a few minutes ago? seems like you're pushing your luck`\Pls don't fuck this up `\http://pollexworld.com/anudrake/meme/porel/blamecanada.jpg`\Maybe i expect too much but we look like shit.`\csn is trash `\There's a few teams he does that against.`\Fucking Crawford just stop it`\3J`\CJ out here breaking ankles!`\The refs are just doing their job.  They called the game in favor of the Pelicans the entire first half to keep the game competitive.  They know what they are doing, that's why  The Blazers get calls at the end.`\Like I said, you are mad that there are a few idiots. Made it sound like everyone was shitting on him. This is how the sub works. There will always be idiots.`\Reviewed a three that was called a two`\Why are the Trailblazers such big outsiders tonight? Getting $2.80 here. That's insane.`\JV lost or something? He was fucking up spacing twice and he missed a Lowry cut and proceeds to lose it.  `\I mean theyre having their best season maybe ever so its not like theyre wishing they had him back`\It's cause Lillard isnt going supernova this game. `\Lmao what a cock`\I mean, that should be statistically nearly impossible. `\don't ever leave us Mike Rice`\So tired of reading all those Mavs fans who already gave up

Bitch after we lose, losers`\    LET'S GO`\comeon ed`\Don't feed the troll, man.  `\oh please like blazers didn't get all that home cooking the last time these 2 played`\31 seconds and a whistle..`\How'd they find Dame open? How can you lose him?`\Thank the lord, it's over. `\Aminu been feeling the 3's lately.  I love it.`\Woahhhh since when does Davis have a nappy fro`\Can't recall any soundbites, but if it is a question posed to him I wouldn't doubt he says that just because players always say they're feeling their best physically. He's really picked up his play the last month or so though.`\Woah a shitty call, what else is new`\He's been up and down the last half dozen games.  He had 33 points on almost 50% shooting four games ago.  Then a down game with only 31% shooting, back up to nearly 50%, and then only 25% in the last game.  `\He moved to OKC `\Could you elaborate? Like can you not touched the head under any circumstances? You can smack their wrist on the follow through if you hit ball first.`\There have been some pretty bad calls already for both sides, but Portland's gonna have it a little worse being away. Granted, that's to be expected with Tony Brothers.`\WIN OR LOSE FOR THE MAVS OR BLAZERS,

WE ALL AGREE,

FUCK

THE ROCKETS.`\We have no answer for JV`\Unfortunately he's been the scapegoat this season because he represents everything us knicks fans have come to hate yet have had to put up with constantly in our players: Aging, bad contract and no defense. I'm not in the "I fucking despise Calderon" camp, but I see why some are.  `\Someone needs to misplace that for the second half... Although that might be too late.`\Lot of credit to Draymond today. He's been really special.`\i would mentally combust `\Ian's going on Shaqtin`\At least it's the East, so there's always a chance to claw your way back in`\Do you even watch Raptor games? His defense has been the only constant, he handled LBJ.`\dame aint fair`\Fucking garbage`\Lillard looks really slow tonight. Rolled both ankles last game, I wonder if that is affecting him. Also took a knee to the sternum. `\Didn't look like he *hit* it, but maybe a twisty landing.`\That was the real heat check.`\Not your fault.

B2B with no Vuc or Payton against a team that wants to play small is a recipe for a bad time.

Once everyone comes back itll be better`\Oh for fuck sake `\Varejao sets some awesome screens.`\BIG ED GETTIN BUCKETS`\Lillard killing  it`\Lawler's law`\I think we hit 80 something in the first half twice last year.`\Gotta get that board, guys.`\Holy over reactions `\That was painful all around`\
