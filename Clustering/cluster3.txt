But Steph dressed like a magnet's a funny image.`\What a bad defender!`\Ok let's calm down`\I honestly thought Derek Fisher was still coaching the Knicks. Silly me`\Do it for bootum `\Yeah, but every time I have been he seems like he is more important then an usher, which made me question that.  Maybe he is just head usher or something`\has Nene been missing layups all year?`\pretty famous blues rock guitarist`\So what happened? I'm confused.`\Curry is pretty good`\Warriors doe`\Why are we headed for 60 losses`\Flop`\Agreed.

Barnes can go fuck off. Who tf is gonna pay this dude? Dray needs to get his head out of his asss.. And everyone needs to stop playing down to the competition. `\This is incredible.`\Not a chance. Just means he won't have to touch that contract money like Shaq. He can live like a king on endorsements while hoarding fat amounts of cheddar.`\curry wrist game strong`\You are given a once in a lifetime opportunity to suck off one player on your team..... Who do you choose and why?

You are also given then opportunity to choose one player on the other team who has to suck you off.... Who and why?`\I'm really starting to buy the calming presence of Iggy. Without him we kinda play too hectic and out of control. A lot of times we get away with it. Sometimes, you get nights like tonight where we turn everything over.`\Look how much more in control our offense is with Price playing the point.`\You know that feeling of doom? `\True...Lowry has regressed a bit recently due to some Bursitis in his right elbow effecting his shooting, but yeah those 2 are basically our team and got us to 2nd in our conference.`\lol fucked up`\OKC watching like "wish we could close out games like that :("`\Girl at that dinner date was fiiiiiiiine `\Actually it is.

He's doing well in other aspects of the game. `\sloppy out there`\Not to rain on the parade but I don't think this lead is sustainable, especially with non-playoff Wittman having the worst halftime adjustments I've seen. We should be up by 20 the way the dubs are playing.  Either way, I'm gonna enjoy this for what it is by having no expectations at all

There was 0 chance that would have worked last season.`\We're up by 34 they just wanna go home.`\Oh curry falling away

We are so much beter without him, I swear`\He has exams/finals!`\Warriors got a ways to go to catch the Rockets' 9000+ 3pm. `\Fuck. I'm so mad that he isn't going to play in the 4th :\ `\when do ya'll get iggy back?`\Tore his meniscus. Out for season.`\Calling it now, Klaymond Greenson takeover in second half. `\Damn, that was a fucking great pass to Barnes`\trash`\He legally changed his name to just Nene. ESPN probably has to list a surname.`\It helped us gain a ton of cap space. If we can make a splash in free agency, then the trade looks better.`\Someone tell me why Curry, Klay, AND Dray have been in the game up 19 with <5 minutes to play? I will be supremely pissed at Kerr if they get injured in any garbage time the rest of the way.`\Barbosa got shafted a little in the 3rd. He should be out there much more considering he has been the best offensive player for the team.`\wow thats annoying for hawks fans holy shit i would be so pissed lol`\DRAY DRAY DRAY! HOLY FUCK`\JJ "I have a cool new sleeve" Reddick trying to be like Curry. I don't recall Reddick ever asking Curry for permission to shoot a 3 against the Warriors. Basketball gods don't like that. `\Don't worry, he's going to challenge DeAndre's dunk numbers`\I wanna se Barnes do well so bad `\He is a robot, after all`\It's been a theme for us all year. We're garbage at rebounding without Millsap on the floor. Horf has his games where he decides he wants to scrap, but that's it.

SOMEONE has to be accountable and at least make an effort to box Mo out. No one did. That's unacceptable.

EDIT: To wit, we gave up near double digit offensive rebounds to Tyson Chandler earlier in the year.`\Never noticed that basketball tatt on Mike Scott. Ball really is life for him. `\Double-teaming Steph 70 feet from the rim at the end of the half LMAO`\Both Curry and Iggy out`\I'd rather play OKC tbh. Clippers match up really well agaisnt us and OKC has been garbage since the all star break.`\We can say that about every team. `\Chris Tucker will forever be remembered by me for the greatest role he ever played - and I was lucky enough to watch this magical performance in theatres when I was a young teenager.

He's smart enough to avoid his 5th, he's done it several times before`\I'm pretty new to basketball but I thought the Warriors were from somewhere in California. Why do they have "The City" on their jerseys? Is this like the Dodgers and SF Giants who used to play in New York City and the Warriors are wearing their old New York unis?`\It doesn't need to be a flagrant to be a hard foul fwiw`\Everyone can shut up about Bogut screens after that Horford screen`\http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/stephen-curry-is-the-revolution/ read through this.

"Curry’s assists per 100 possessions has plummeted (11.6 last year, 8.5 so far this year, his lowest since 7.8 his rookie year). It’s probably fair to infer that Curry is taking more shots that he used to set up for teammates."`\Both Klay and Millsap are shooting 25%!! Fun!`\lol I didn't think so, that's ridiculous -- I probably say this every year but refs seem to suck especially hard this year throughout the league. `\I'll take one Klay Thompson if you guys hate him so much.`\I think a lot of that can just be attributed to not being acclimated to the NBA game. Tough for a 29-year-old Tunisian to bust out of nowhere. Even in the D-league he looked a little outta place on offense.


If he can start by having his hands ready to catch passes, he'd be more effective. But who knows, maybe it will come out of nowhere with the increased playing time and progression.`\im here to watch devin booker`\this might get ugly.`\John Wall was horrible to end the half, Wizards just took bad shot after bad shot. They looked clueless on offense the last 3 minutes`\Like, Mo 3s aren't a normal thing, right? This is just the Hawks making yet another player seem awesome somehow, right?

Edit: Thanks guys. Just needed to make sure the Warriors hadn't also turned Speights into a 3 point threat. I'd just take time away from watching the NBA for a few years`\Speights`\Really??? It is like tropical weather during this couple weeks`\If you don't like that you don't like NBA basketball.`\Is this a joke? Have you seen J.J. Hickson?`\He still is....`\these games are the worst because you know you're gonna lose but you still get mad about it anyway`\lololololololololooolol.  Fuck outa here.
`\Looked like Draymond grabbed him before he got past, that's why it wasn't called as a clear path.`\breaking klaynkles`\Lol Curry only has 2 also. `\Why are we so fucking terrible?

Why do the Sports Gods hate Atlanta so much?

Why can't we have nice things?`\I personally think Spurs might have the best chance because of their defense but don't think Cavs, Thunder, or Clippers can win a 7 game series against the Warriors.`\orlando already thrown in the towel? or were the starters just that bad`\GG New Orleans`\Dirk?`\KLAY STOP TAKING SHITTY SHOTS GOD DAMMIT`\How lucky can you get. This is like the perfect convergence of bullshit.`\Why isn't Livingston out there?`\He is sick...why he is still playing who knows`\The Squidward's house comparison had me laughing for days.`\What's with whiny Raptors fans lately?

He dropped 40 last time curry was out. Does that mean he was proven last time?

I know exactly why you said what you said but the theory doesnt hold weight regardless of today. You have a sample size of like 3 games this season.`\Yeah, this one's on Klay and Harrison.`\Das me!`\I mean they've looked hilariously bad. They've been outscored 32-17`\That was bullshit, he gave dray the ball!`\Rooting for a D.Lee triple double! and a win for the dubs :)`\lol nah i dont get time to play MY Team anymore :(    i only play versus mode against my bros when i have time these days`\Great pass from Green to Klay`\I'm surprised he's not 'injured' yet. He usually goes down with an 'injury' when he's being humiliated.`\Draymond is all over the place on defense. He is getting his hands on every pass in the paint.`\Bogoat!`\Why in the hell would the Clippers keep switching DeAndre onto Curry? It's like they're trying to imitate the Spurs and failing very, very badly.`\Wtf happened to Ryan Anderson?`\i guess he

paid the price`\Possibly why West didn't join the Dubs. Didn't want his points go to Mo`\Really, dubs? My heart health is still recovering from Saturday's game... I can't take much more of this`\Barnes, you are killing us.`\21 assists in the half on 29 FGM.

It applies to any major city.

We need this bench to start functioning properly again, hopefully Iguodala & Ezeli returning will fix this.`\Yes`\Mo Yam'd that one.`\Barnes giving it up at the rim.`\looney is out`\Just like they drew it up. The hockey deflection pass.`\You maybe right I think it was in oakland though. `\If I were an Atlanta fan I'd be pissed as hell`\It was by design. Someone posts something irrelevant and I respond with something irrelevant.

Well son it was a very different game back then. One of the things players used to do was fight for positioning close to the basket. Back then tall players had an advantage as they were able to get closer to the hoop. It wasn't uncommon to see guys over 6 and a half or 7 feet tall on the court in those days. Of course now everybody over 6'4" has to go through mandatory height-reducing surgery introduced under Hillary Clinton's privilege initiative. There was also a thing called passing. That was when you threw the ball to another person on your team. Also, most shots were only worth two points. I think that's still a rule, but nobody takes those anymore.`\He hasn't been all year.

I would rather overpay Barnes right now and have him locked up through his prime then let him leave and then go through his prime on another team.

* There are no dedicated PvP game modes/maps (like Team Deathmatch, Capture/defend, etc)

* The Darkzone is a great idea with poor execution. The idea is an area where you can be a hero or a rebel, but the disadvantages for going rebel make it so no one plays as intended, instead you have a bunch of people trying to bait others into going red to attack them
* Great cover system, but there is no stealth against eh computer AI, so its all very repetitive combat, as soon as you fire once, just dive for cover and pop enemies repeat for ever

* all the enemies are bullet sponges with turrible AI

and on and on and on.

(from Posting and Toasting)

1. An older Kristaps Porzingis -- from a future where he has already won 4 MVPs -- transfers his consciousness to the rookie Porzingis. Blessed with both the wisdom of age and the spirit of youth, Kristaps scores 65 points.

2.  Load up Kyle O'Quinn's beard with some illegal, blinding substance, then put him on the floor to rub his beard in the eyes of every Warrior.

5. Pretending to be Warriors owner Joe Lacob, call every player before they leave for the arena and say, "Hey guys, the new arena we're building in San Francisco is finished ahead of schedule, so we're playing there tonight." Then, when all the Warriors have gathered there, blow up all the bridges between San Francisco and Oakland.`\Watch CP3 harass Curry in the first quarter but Curry will pick up the quick fouls.

Keep doing what you're doing.`\come on!`\FUCK`\Well this is some sloppy bullshit`\mavs had plenty of moving screens, why aren't you complaining about them?`\Speights is actually a pretty decent offensive rebounder. It's one his few redeeming qualities`\Mo Speights with the money 1st 3PA as per usual`\Of course we're trailing: Curry and Barnes have same number of shot attempts.`\MO BUCKETS`\Ducking autocorrect. He's a C. C goes to Cleveland I guess.

Also we need to start Alex to see if he's any good or not (we have four draft picks, have to figure out if we want a C). But we need to accommodate Chandler, who's finally healthy and has been a professional. Hasn't demanded trade despite terrible team. `\Don't steal my sunshine, Len.`\Should have`\Make your shots Dennis! Edit: asshole`\Good shit Warriors.`\Stream?`\Bogut has gone from 2/23 on 3 pointers to 3/24 on 3 pointers for his career.  That's a 4% point increase on one shot.`\LETS GO`\Mo Speights is David West's lost twin`\Hawks have been doing almost all of that so well minus the high picks which may be the most important part. haha. I'll say second most important due to them not being super helpful if you don't have a front office who knows what they're doing`\warriors playing with energy`\I'm sure some kind of record is going to be broken tonight, by either player or team.  `\Perhaps it is my recency bias but he hasn't seemed to shoot them well in forever. `\Brick after brick for the Pelicans`\That Klay Thompson walk

so did the 3rd foul call against Atlanta on Barbosa though`\BOGOAT`\BOGUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUT SPLASH COUSIN`\Exactly. Kerr fucking up. `\Mo is just going nuts! Great for him.`\These turnovers. `\It's like he used all of his clutchness that he'll ever have in that sequence `\Who are the others?`\What's the alternative, going back to JT?`\Draymond Green is pretty good at basketball....`\THIS JUST IN: Doc Rivers has a greasy forehead`\Touchdown!`\It was cool when Dudley was making shots for us. `\gorgeous `\So happy BRush isn't a bum anymore`\Klay wants player of this week too`\STOP`\Haha same here!

Now look at this shit. `\Dennis "not steph curry" Schroder`\gg hawks`\Yeah he sounds great and doesn't show that much homerism. I don't like your salty play by play though lol`\Fitz is the homer hype man. If you're not a warriors fan I dare say he's bad enough to overrule the neutrality and historic insight JB has to just not watch our cast. The whistles have been pretty chill this game but some games when there is a discrepancy you can practically hear his salty tears in the microphone haha `\Fun while it lasted`\That escalated quickly`\Someone reboot Klay, he's acting up again`\Okafor is out, fam.`\ahhh, the ryan kelly playstyle of pump fake and drive for the obvious block/miss`\lol barnes shot was way off`\He wasn't THAT much better.  `\It was fun while it lasted.`\this game feels like a pickup game right now`\LB is so good for our offense `\Klay "Stephen Curry" Thompson`\Most Wizards fans are from MD and VA I think`\#QUITE FRANKLY THESE NEW SHOES NEED TO HAVE RUBBER ON THE OUTSIDE EDGES, NOT JUST THE SOLE`\Klay really needs to step up in OT.

And I'm sure my estimate is probably not even close. I would frankly say they spent double that on airtime. Also Not sure if the NBA stars got paid a lot or if they were sort of obligated to do it cheap for the league. But if a corporation tried having that star power it would cost a shit load.

This happens every once in a while. They are both studs. teague was pretty solid in his minutes today and had a trey taken away bcs of a moving screen in the 1st half. Wouldn't be surprised at all if his wrist is bothering him still.

The lack of respect for teague is incredible. He had some ankle issues earlier this season and his numbers are slightlyyy down but teague > schroder. And Teague is having a career year from deep shooting over 40%.

The end of last season they fiddled with teague and schroder on the court at the same time but not at all this year.

Atlanta is a playoff team. No matter what people say it isn't championship or bust. Yeah Schroder is the pg of the future but pissing away some playoff wins and tons of money while disrespecting a former all star who has spent 7 years on your team, all for a couple draft picks, makes minimal sense.

He made that with 18 seconds left, I have seen possessions like that where they just dribble it out (for a shot clock violation) instead of shooting, thats all I'm saying.

He did it with Gordon he did it with Asik and I have a feeling he may do it with Ryan if he strikes out on FA this year. He refused to see year after year this core was too injury prone to play together and made the right moves. I don't blame him so much with the drafting because since he's been here day 1 it was his job to either cut cost or win now which never allowed him to build a team properly. My gripe against Gentry is unwillingness to adjust. He refuses to adjust his system to his personnel so he rather lose his way than win a different way. His lack of adjustment and awful rotations are reasons why I see he's succeeds as a assistant and fail as a head coach. We went from one of the best offensive rebounding teams and point scored in the paint to the worse. Why would you so strongly go away from a team strengths? Despite injuries Gentry has shown me he's not a good head coach I also believe the team and the org won't walk away from him.

hahaha there's no beating these guys.`\lmfao `\Dray's FT shooting has gone considerably down since All Star.`\The GSW big 3 are having monster games.

Curry is having one of his best defensive games of the season with 4 steals and 9 rebounds. He has really active hands and he's been playing the lanes all night. Even won that jump ball with the taller Fournier.

Draymond has 10 assist through 3 quarters. Constantly pushing the ball and winning the break.

Klay is just casually shooting 50% from the floor and from 3 while carrying the scoring load in the first half.

Their only problem is the turnovers. A few less TOs and they would be leading by 30+.`\Do you guys think Shaun could start a team like the Bucks or 76ers?`\It's pretty bad. Dubs are getting called on touch fouls after getting no-calls on hacks at the other end.`\How has he been chasing a triple double? He had 7 assists at half.

Ok that's a lie I want to see it like every game.`\Geez OT`\That's why he said if you don't succeed try try again lol`\Williams somehow got screened by Calderon on that Green layup`\Thought that was a pretty obvious foul too`\That one actually wasn't a moving screen. I'm sure there have been some this game but this one was legal. The suns guard initiates contact into Green and Green kinda moves with the guard to appear like he's getting pushed by the momentum of the guard. As long as he's still in the refs eyes when contact is initiated the rest is kinda like incidental. That being said I think it'll get fixed eventually cause it's basically a super illegal screen.

Also hating guys like Tyreke even tho we are much better with him because he doesn't play like golden state. I didn't see golden state get good copying off the Heat and Spurs.

But, yeah, that last Klay 3 could have been done without.`\Cause it's the Lakers. And we didn't just lose, we got embarrassed.

They didn't score for 4 min to start the 4th`\Warriors fans..... Who are you more worried about.... Okc, clips, or Spurs ?`\Nope. We're nowhere near competing to use an old guy like Klay. Would rather rebuild correctly with Booker. And I think Booker is a season or two at most from where Klay is now offensively.`\You know what, a MVP and a FMVP might be important for the team`\gg`\true`\We lead the league in open threes and missed open threes.`\Dirk was carefully inspecting Lee's ring. `\It's one game out of 82...and then even more for the playoffs. You won't remember this game in 1-2 weeks.`\Gawk`\is this fucking real?`\Klay Thompson Corner 3? YESSSIRRR`\No matter what, no matter how, no matter who, the FUCKING Warriors find a way to win. It's like a cheat code. `\Speights shoots that 3 like his midrange.

Why... `\TREE ROLLINS IN HIS GRAVE`\    what is Draymond`\Man how the hell are the Mavs letting HB matchup with Barea?`\beat me to it`\I'm expecting a low-20's pts in the 3rd qrt from both teams.`\Varejo is so trash to me`\I can not for the life of me understand blocking out in the NBA. Is there some reason players don't find a man to box out every time a shot goes up?`\His first three missed of the game was uncontested at the top of the arc `\What's more bleak, this Knicks season or the division dark zone?`\Curry is pissed lol`\There's a certain lack of hate when Griffin isn't mean mugging everyone.`\KLAYSTATION3`\For every 1 shot Varejao takes, he has 10 pumpfakes`\Steph, please stop making those shots.`\sessions has been so bad lately`\Not really`\livingston not lookin good tonight`\Why didn't Phoenix try to get a shot off before time ran out? They had enough time and the guy shot it as soon as the buzzer sounded.

This happened in the OKC game as well. I know it's unlikely to be made but are people just preserving their stats?`\you should see Ryan Kellys hair then `\such a fun game going to end anticlimatic because the Warriors are fucking absurd`\this is the worst ive ever seen Klay play`\Dray looks so small guarding chandler`\He's a very good off ball defender.`\Steph is gassed lol`\Wall needs to stop pretending he's Curry and play like he's John Wall. `\Hey man, he's just trying to get his second point man.`\Bring back Lin`\Get that weak shit OUTTA HERE

Edit: OTTO HERE`\We just did dis`\Draymonds has his head up his ass on these horrible telegraphed passes.`\Lol Warriors, lack of execution and killing instinct is something they have been struggling with since January.`\Why are they drawing up a play for Draymond?`\bad goaltend, ball wasn't going in`\Does the verticality rule not exist anymore?`\I love this comment like a fat kid loves cake`\Chill man, it's a reference. Kobe and Jordan Clarkson.`\This is the NBA and honestly any team can beat another team on any given night. That being said, please don't lose to the fucking 76ers. `\Dray is a showman.

`\Omg, the refs are so terrible

Creating so much drama

They're calling a lot on both teams after not calling any`\He wishes he was Steph Curry every time he notices it's 11:11. `\Anderson should be on the low block more often`\Isn't that the 4 out 1 in strat?

Did Doc's brain break??`\3 > 2`\Eh. That's what happens when a team gets good though. I'm also a Royals fan (live in KC) and at first I was frustrated with all of the fans coming out of the woodwork acting like they were there for all of our 90 loss seasons, but there's no reason to fight it. They're gonna exist when a team wins. If you guys win a championship, you'll have the same thing. `\However you may feel about the Warriors, we are all blessed to witness this. How lucky are we to be for the NBA to be as good as it is.`\this thread not working wtf? Or is everyone just quiet?`\based on how /r/nba was soooooooo quick to crucify everything warriors for the last 24 hours, seems like a loss for the warriors carries way more weight than the loss for any other team. It's fucking stupid, but that's what happens when you're trying to go sub 10 losses for a season.`\Same comment, different thread. Stop bitching about warriors doing something everyone does. `\we out here`\Stop calling fouls every possession refs ffs...`\The Warriors stop-started more in that quarter than my Grandfather driving.   `\It's weird being a huge Raiders fan but I've always loved the Lakers/Clippers, show me whatcha got LA!`\Damn, the crowd cheering them on made me feel good.

Didn't know free throws counted towards that`\Yea ik but recent history gives us a pretty good idea of how it will end.`\That team has everything they need, except a good coach. If they do get one, and hopefully one that will utilize them very well, then they are going to be a very scary team next year.`\hi`\Okay, that should've been a foul on Bogut`\lmao @ the drunk guy flexing for the camera `\Alex Len !!`\Could have been different if D-Will or Parsons played but I can't be certain either.`\we still lead the league in assists im pretty sure`\Circus shot of the year.`\Did you bet on the Sixers actually winning, or the 21.5 pt spread?`\What a difference having Bogut back makes.`\Klay with 3 jumpers in a row. `\What a shit no call`\Well...they already have 46 (?) straight home wins and the best record after 65 games, so technically can already refer to the as record-breaking`\GET YOUR UMBRELLAS HERE!

No justice in this world.#`\BOGOAT`\Dray has to put up with some shit calls night after night`\MO, you understand charges make absolutely no sense in the NBA. Fall down iams.`\Klay streaky af`\YOU AIN'T CURRY`\He is shooting WORSE than Lamar Odom did for us in his abominable stint. Yet he keeps seeing the court again and again`\I just came. `\It seems that way but its always 50/50 on these spreads.

B)`\This is the moment when Steph usually hits some clutch threes.`\Jesus Christ, Millsap `\Yeah that was ridiculously obvious.`\Haha dray the bully `\Anyone else in the Bay Area watching this on CSNBA on Comcast? Is the feed a little blurry for you? It's giving me a damn headache.

Edit - thanks all for the replies. A few of us are seeing it so maybe I'll file a complaint if it doesn't clear up. I'm sure Comcast will care. Other channels are fine, it's just the game. `\And booker doesn't have as much room for growth as a 12 year old does. I use 12 because that's a seven year age gap- same as the gap between devin and klay. Could the 12 year old become better? Yes. The reasoning behind the trade is guaranteed quality level`\For such a good shooting team, we sure have a lot of bad free throw shooters.`\Refs are shit.`\Cause Steph and Iggy were playing against OKC but 2 "miracle" freethrows by Iggy made the game go to OT. They bleed just as easy, minus all the ref interference.`\Reddit name checks out as non bandwagon`\who's this #1 on philly? he's fast as hell.`\Dray with 2 blocks on AD, lookin like the DPOY`\Mo Speights will win the ASG 3pt contest next year.

Primarily worked in the restricted area?`\I think it's over 100 by now`\I just saw Livingston shoot a 3 live I've seen everything. `\The ref with the best angle doesn't call it but the one 40 feet away does duck tht`\Well... That's how it works when you're the "team to beat"`\I think it's just called a finish by Curry these days.

Don't get me wrong, I'm still not desensitized to the jaw-dropping things that his holiness, THREESUS - SKY FUCKER, routinely pulls off. I just don't think they're ridiculous because it's Curry. It's not what I expect from him, but I'm hardly surprised when he makes shots that are improbable.`\Bogut: "fuck this scorelessness"`\I wish he was out play play for the dubs. `\where's mo? and shaun and LB also slumping somewhat recently..`\It's a 6 point game`\C'mon Harrison, Mo has a midget on him `\brb becoming an animagus`\I heard he just quietly walked to his car and drove home after the 3rd`\Great passing by the Clips but they just couldn't finish`\Did they just run him off a zipper screen?  I guess I don't watch the Mavs enough, but the idea of running zipper screens to get Charlie Villaneuva open enough to take a fadeaway three...seems...weird to me.`\Without Steph in there, Dubs offense is terrible`\He is just such a bad shooter it's frustrating

Edit: Bad is the wrong expression. He's very very inconsistent`\Klay on some real dude shit ��`\both teams are shooting better on threes's than on two's...`\"Curry!"`\wtf how Dray`\Jesus these refs are just genuinely awful. We go from not getting shit for calls the entire game to us getting ticky tack stuff at the end and a huge missed call when Dray fouled Schroder on the fastbreak.

Shit like this detracts from otherwise good games, there's no reason both teams should have to *fear* the refs, you shouldn't have to guess what's gona be called on a nightly basis.

edit: and now both teams are going to the line every possession for light contact. Bloody hell.

edit2: why don't we just flip a fucking coin. Both teams should be frustrated after this shit show.`\This close to the record and playoffs? There's no time or room for trap games now i'm afraid.`\Injured and old. It doesn't help that our offense often nds in iso Melo and Rambis is playing him a million minutes a game. He needs to work crazy hard for his poins and his body can't keep up with it.`\SHUSH`\Barbosa is a fast man`\CHARLIE V VS KLAY DUEL`\Hope rush steps up tonight! Going to need him with Iggy out`\In true Suns fashion, they let someone like Speights go off...`\Oh barnes. `\[Pop digs the half time show](http://i.giphy.com/xT0BKE3pKmCd4RTQIM.gif)`\That's why the Hawks have turned a corner. They will eventually find the right roster. I don't think they are far from being the best in the East.`\yeah, even i felt bad about that call for klay slipping.`\At this point losing by 50 would be a blessing. `\what happened to Derek Fisher?`\Go warriors!`\Love this game no matter what. Len and Booker playing well. If we win, it's good for the kids moral for the rest of the season and gives them hope that they can build on for next season. If we lose, it's just part of the tank. `\You kidding me?`\Honestly I like Jeff Green better as a fit.`\Dammit dis dude did`\I feel you but when HB has those double double games I don't know`\SEE AMAZING HAPPEN`\Curry. Wow.`\K but you aren't finishing the season with it`\Cooking with the Currys lol srs?`\Wtf is this`\Even better, he came in immediately`\Curry tryna be fancy.`\**A Concise Game Guide for Tonight**

They could be regular warrior fans who are actually TURNED INTO  SCREAMING LITTLE GIRLS by Steph's Brilliance?

???`\Mo with 20!`\Wow, Shaun Livingston had one hell of a NBA journey from looking at his wiki.  Glad he found some great success with the Warriors.`\So what happens? Does it automatically take you to the off-season or you just keep simulating games while taking care of off-court stuff?`\I'd like for the other teams to take note`\This is end times.

He is relentless about player's shoes.`\Clippers are 0-3 against the Clippers?`\Steph with an off night. Klay is the only one who has it going on this team`\I've watched every clipper game this season and I'm positive we wouldn't be in the playoffs without him. let alone having home court advantage. `\The duel of the year: Rivers vs Barnes. Who can fuck their team over more?`\Yup even my husband (who's a massive Warriors fan) said the exact same thing about the Charlie V foul. It was clearer than daylight. `\8 points just like that...`\ITS GOOOOD`\JB on Ish Smith, after scoring a difficult layup

"Where did this all come from?"`\Assuming I know the guy you're talking about, he's annoying af`\Steph is a good defender.`\hey if you can't handle the truth I can't help you.  `\Lol for real.

But yah that's embarrassing.`\dude he's been getting blocks

the future is now`\lol`\Looks like someone already mentioned it, but just to reiterate, can't stream this game unfortunately. I'll be able to do the game on friday, but not the spurs on saturday or the rest of next week. Thanks for understanding.`\no flair `\wow Steph that rebound`\meh he doesnt make many nowadays`\Bogut makes a mean point guard.`\He has not looked confident at all since coming back from injury. He started off So Well but since has not been playing like a contract year player. He does the little things, but there are games where Dray has more shot attempts than him, meaning he's not finding his shots. This is true when you're a dump-off guy, a spot-up 3 ball shooter who is expected to rebound and defend the post. But god damn he can't dribble at all, he tries to iso people and has no lateral quickness, it's like he's in mud. He can "kinda" post but his footwork isn't anything special. He can defend a player trying to post him up and that's pretty much his best asset, alongside him hitting spot-up threes.

To me there are plenty of long rangey players who aren't demanding max money out there. We have a few on our bench for christ's sake. I shouldn't be this cynical.

Let's get him some pointssss`\This is fine...`\BALL DON'T LIE`\Hahaha`\The foul was on draymond though?`\I think Spurs and Warriors will split the season series each protecting their home court. `\"this is my son, duck. and this is my daughter, another."`\Curry's unselfishness/bad decision making cost us an easy 6-8 points. Needs to shoot the wide open shot.`\\#30 with his feet set in the short corner? Good night Dallas`\and theres why you dont just double / trap Curry near halfcourt`\Jaotekumbo`\Especially win. `\lol about fucking time.`\all these fouls`\So you sharing her at the arena then?`\Gentry been eating warheads on the bench, thats why hes got that perma sour face`\That was the best any big has defended Curry on the perimeter. `\BEAL OH MY`\��`\Thank goodness for the defense, Klay another streaky cold shooting night 5/14`\Did JJ Reddick really allow that layup b/c Chris Paul didn't pass to him in the previous possession?`\Damn CP3 has been ass`\why would they be embarassed?  Mavs just got hot, it happens every once in awhile`\I honestly didn't see the foul`\Imagine if Warren G was still playing, he always goes crazy @ the Warriors.`\oh no steph, oh my god`\*If you don't like that headflop, you don't like 2010s NBA basketball!*`\Fuck the Clippers`\What the hell `\Can you imagine a game where Eric Bledsoe, Brandon Knight, Devin Booker, and Alex Len all playing well? That's tough to stay with. `\8-27

>>>scores most of the OT points`\As a niner fan, I'm so ashamed`\��������`\Was u/rabsho a genius all along? `\HE'S NOT A ROBOT! `\It was, but why would Horford try to go through the guy with his back turned?  He literally jumped into Clark and could have just dribbled around him.`\Just tuned in...

Been a Mo Buckets game, clearly.`\People arent kidding about Speights being awful at defense`\Warriors shooting a cool 90% in the quarter `\Go Warriors! `\What a lob`\I still remember watching him dominate for Syracuse and thinking he was going to bring a championship to whatever team he played for.`\Is a anywhere a stream that doesn't have the fucking cle-hou game on for fuck's sake?`\If we hit free throws and got a few more calls yeah maybe, I'd say being down by 10 to the warriors is a close game.`\Booker D through the backdoor :D`\Objectively speaking, Phoenix probably still would have won if Phoenix didn't tank this game on purpose (putting in Price, posting up Chandler, going away from the hot man, etc)`\Wall just threw up a cinder block lmao`\and shoved Milsap`\i mean its not like the defender right in front of curry could do anything about it. he drops back to pick up barnes and curry shoots a three. `\Definitely starting to look shook out there...`\just got in, how have we looked so far?

MCADOOOOOOOOOOOO!`\Well, they just doomed us by showing that OT record graphic`\4 decades with the Warriors, JB is an institution. `\I think the best way to guard Curry is to not guard him.`\If you make 4 shots in a row you should be allowed to stay in the paint for as long as you want`\This season is awesome `\holy shit what a defensive play`\Are you saying that you like the NYK announcers, or that you dislike the GSW announcers?  I personally hate the Warriors announcers but I'd be surprised to hear one of their fans agree`\Is it just me or do these announcers sound like their totally dead inside? `\I keep dropping my arm when I do that. `\Freq'in & Vibin`\TBH A Aron did get robbed in the slam dunk contest.`\if steph and klay bumped nasties and klay accidentally became pregnant... that baby would be Devin Booker `\The real test is gonna be when the benches come in.

German Rondo is a stud`\lol Klay trying to hit that turnaround going 100mph the other way.`\[That dunk!](https://twitter.com/BullsFreeCheese/status/704896329542213632)`\Wtf Knight?`\Our pick may be in jeopardy, but at least the Wizards lost. `\You guys are spoiled. You're supposed to have a few games like this. (Though maybe not to such a struggling team.)`\Klay I swear to god `\warriors really grinding it out `\Curry 3/3 when I turn on the tv to watch the game. I'm the chosen one.`\MAC ATTACK`\These Hardcore Henry reviews are from sites I've never even heard of. `\Good game GSW! Paul definitely needs to match Curry and the team needs to keep up with their 3pters to keep it close.

Nice defence by Curry tonight too`\If we continue to turn it over once per minute - well, that wouldn't be good.`\fouled lolol`\The annual post-ASG 3-point percentage increase. I have no idea why it happens, but it does.`\>consistent

he shot 15% last game`\with the south paw
`\Please ATL, don't break my heart again.`\Draymond playing center on defense and point guard on offense.`\Barnes has gone MIA. Dray has not been good and Bogut doesn't score much. No Andre or Ezeli off the bench either.`\Hey, at least you're Spurs East and haven't been out of the playoffs in forever.`\Honest question : what team do warriors fans feel has the best shot at ending your legendary season out of the Thunder, Spurs, Clips and Cavs ?`\Warriors are gearing up for the playoffs. That's all that can be said about their mentality tonight. `\Deandre has given up like one 3 if any to curry. Curry keeps taking stupid shots over him`\omg this fucking game lol`\Warriors can't get a basket to fall right now.  `\Yeah Milwaukee is better XD`\Oh Lord yes. His rookie year with sooooo many missed layups. It was officially over IMO when he played really well against the Spurs game 2 of WC semifinals in 2013. From there, he's progressively gotten better and better with layups.`\Barnes turning down that 16M a year is a blessing in disguise now.`\Watch out boys Klay made a basket`\Is this real life?`\well thats a wrap boys`\Muresan and Lauren Jackson?`\Draymond is a robot`\Wow their ragging on his shitty shoes.`\Is this another copy pasta?`\My point was really that it's not true warriors fans that cause problems and make people hate them, it's the assholes who become fans about 2 months before a championship run, then gloat in other fans' faces. But the real fans still get all the flack, which is really unfortunate.`\I can't unsee goomba on speights`\Crawford and LB`\Only the Warriors commit moving screens. `\I think JRich could've done it. `\We have the lead!!!!! Shut it down, turn off the lights, destroy the backup generator.`\/r/cringe`\He's good, no doubt.

No wonder the Warrior Commentators were swinging on his nuts.
`\Why?`\FIELD GOAL AND THE FOUL`\Lol. It's cute how Phoenix keeps trying. The Warriors have 6 footers guarding their 7 footers on post ups. `\How come Draymond can block shots at the rim but his three pointers look like gravity is turned up 2x`\lol bogut is such a punk what a shove`\Why not nationally televise this game? Either the biggest upset of all time or the Warriors show off.`\Tuned in just in time for a Mo Speights 3 and an Austin Rivers fast break lay up.  The stars are here to play tonight`\Some say the Knicks are still passing the ball.....`\If only it was like hockey. `\He went 1-7 from threes last game. In the 10 games before that he shot 39%.

He's a good bench player. He just plays too many minutes. `\plz come through :D `\Dirk not in today? `\SNIPER!`\Curry dance on em ��`\Did cornell west just catch that airball?`\Klay smoked some dank shit, he needs to go bang a instagram model to get his mojo back`\Bogut: can't believe I am playing with a team of scrubs that can't even score`\dray working on expanding his range`\I don't think the refs are allowed to call fouls against Golden State this game`\I mean this in the nicest way possible - Steph is fucking retarded`\Pelicans coach is high. look at his eyes`\True dat, hopefully HB is in it for the long con this year. All season is a show, of sorts, and it's only in the playoffs when he turns it on and actually starts trying...please?`\I said it the first step thread today, Nene is fast as shit...but always misses.`\Jason Smith is so off. He's usually money from there.`\Still playing, Klay`\It's like 2K's rubber banding. You only make shots when you're down 15.`\If the 76ers win this, I might shit myself. Heck, Hinkie might shit himself too.`\no Knick helped Calerdon on the screen.`\not fucking human`\What a freaking circus shot!`\that was all so ugly`\it was just pretty funny tbh. i mean frustrating as hell, but after a point it was actually kinda funny, the whole absurdity of the event was just monumental.`\It's actually Oklahoma State.`\Phil and Rambis needs to go. They fucking suck at their job.`\4`\Damn he's 37?

Anyway my point isn't that Iggy should get that much. But Iggy is more productive than Barnes and could easily be placed in the starting spot for a year or two more. Barnes is easily replaceable`\CURRY!`\i know i thought morris kicked it`\It is though`\McADONT`\I'm just here for the CAWS`\That thread is going berserk right now`\The fuck?`\He's like me in 2K`\Holy shit Speights...`\Tragically destroyed `\Good shit`\Curry passed up a wide open three and passed the ball to Klay but he wasnt paying attention and it hit his legs `\YEAH DAY DAY EAT EAT DAY DAY EAT`\yay curry 3! hopefully that will keep him going`\0 points in over 3 minutes ):`\when our moment comes its gonna be glorious`\god forbid someone takes a hard foul and falls in a "contact" sport`\Klayyy lmao`\Don't do it to em DJ`\Good to know`\Draymond that is way out of your range. `\WHY THE FUCK DO WE NOT SET A FUCKING HIGH SCREEN JESUS CHRIST`\Ball dontttt lie`\I saw a terrible charge call, no whining.`\Fuck that was a clutch 3 by Klay`\We still get Klay ups... `\Wow having three six footers who can't shoot or create didn't work, shocker. `\WHAT lol`\The commentators were totally jealous of the bro-romance that Curry and his shooting coach has.`\This game has been over, why aren't we playing grant and porzingis? there's literally no reason to not play them. What the fuck.`\HB puts in the late dagger`\I mean I said we needed to start playing defense, but making all your shots in a row helps too I guess... Shoutout to the refs for that no call on Bknight who got slaughtered!`\BIG MAC DUNK`\Dude, really?`\This is almost a must win after Detroit won tonight. `\Damn are warrior fans this whiney all the time? Chasing record books must change people.`\they really do suck`\Lol OK.`\Steph was not getting blocked that time. I want to know what he said though. "Shuck yeah" or something.`\I knew wed find a spectacular way to lose when fucking Millsap missed that wide open 3. Dennis missing these free throws is just icing on the shit cake  `\That was classic Gonzaga.`\basketball!`\Did I just see Kuiper sitting court side?`\Barnes just isn't very aggressive at times.`\Thanks for making it when it really counts.`\its crazy that almost our entire first string is out `\I was gonna downvote then I saw the bold part.`\don't wanna get anthony davis pregnant. `\the US don't need drones no more, just ask steph to shoot missiles`\TAT & 1`\lol`\if only we could unleash our death lineup of macadoo, clark and looney`\Shaun...where the fuck did your defense go...smh`\Holy crap. Did I just see Bogut hit a three?`\#Rush >>> Barnes#`\I never see anything about Alex Len on this sub, dude looks so damn good this game. `\Knight is on fire my god.`\he prob wanted JMM to go up a bit quicker, could've gotten the layup off`\People downvoting you thinking you're actually complaining about it lol`\where is jeff teague? is he injured?`\The Warriors are just in a whole different league.  `\ouch fuck not ian!`\I don't watch enough of the Wizards to know, but is Wall usually this bad at shooting? The guy looks like a college freshman out there taking shots. I know he can finish at the rim like no other, but god damn this shit is ugly.`\Yeah little bit of a stretch lol`\the german blur`\I remember when Pop used it as a reason to bench Tim Duncan. Never gets old. Heh.`\What I wouldn't give for Curry to box out DJ`\Nene you suck bro`\no foul?`\Kenny has to end every sentence with "man"`\Honestly I gotta say he's worth it. he is so young and is already money on 3-and-d.`\I mean I'd take him for 10M lol`\I fucking love this team!`\Are we gonna have a 40 pts 4th quarter?`\Draymond is so off with his passing`\What if told you he sat out the 4th quarter?`\Klay plz`\He does it every time lol. Get used to it`\I'm really sad for HB's scoring drought, but that shot attempt after the fancy move was hilarious.`\Now that the comments are working, that tech on CP3 was bullshit considering Draymond has been barking in refs faces all game and hasn't been called for it`\They call him S. Dot, I call him Shaun Killingston`\Imagine if the Warriors lost tonight.`\Stupid turnovers.`\I laughed too, I love JB but this team has freaking Bogut.

&gt;&gt; `\which 3? dirk, parsons and.. ?`\lmao, seeing Ian Clark on Melo was like, this kid is gonna die`\Mo thr33's`\They are 4-8 when curry has missed a game over the last 2 seasons(might be 3 seasons).`\Fuck it lets try to win this`\Maybe he will break his shooting hand on a trainer's face`\3 in 6 doe`\okay i definitely agree then.`\It happens all the time with like 27 seconds left on the clock and then it goes down to 3 seconds before the 24 second violation. No team just continually has 24 second clock violations to end a game.`\How did Steph even do that`\When did you become a Blazers fan? When you were born? Or when you were conceived? Or when the egg that became you was formed inside your mother's body? `\Buy low and draft well for a few years(helps to have a bunch of high picks). Get yourself a good staff who knows what they are doing.`\THJ is on fire!!!`\bullshit, dray was hacked on obvious shooting foul.`\Cool. Tinikling!`\Bogut is playing awesome.`\lmao tyson chandler post up. just what th eusns needed`\Jesus green, that 3pter was baddddd.  `\That rim protection was sorely missed against the Spurs.`\Praying that this game goes better than the Mavs Clippers game... But we have Jason Smith starting. should be...fun`\Wow. That deficit closed really fast.`\I was a huge Beans fan, but his career died when Baron left. `\Crawford is garbage`\ɹǝɥʇoɹq ɥsɐlds`\A Charlie V heat check, never thought id see one of those`\Oh well, if this is his last shining moment in the NBA, then it is a glorious one. `\This is going down to the wire isn't it`\Seriously?`\Hell yeah they are`\HB needs to go to a sports psychologist or something. He's still decent defensively, but he's lot all confidence on the offensive side. This isn't new either, he had a problem coming off the bench too under Mark Jackson.`\He was forced into retirement before? Is that the play by play guy?`\I like when shots go in.`\*Another* night of shooting struggles for Klay, if it weren't for the layups :(

Shooting like 30% 3FG and low 40%s overall`\In what way? Knight is a nice player but I don't think he's really a starter on a championship team. He can be a great 6th man though. If they think he's too talented to come off the bench, both he and Bledsoe are very tradeable.`\It's the theme `\What the fuck was that steal lmao`\*sigh*`\To Chris Paul:
Get well soon.`\It took Mo 40 seconds to score. That's about 30 seconds too long. `\DIS GAME`\Dray is beastin on D`\Isn't this almost a repeat of the game in Orlando where for a while the Magic did well for a while just charging to the basket almost every possession?`\We have 20 more shots than you and 4 *fewer* FTs.`\Curry 37, Klay 27, next highest scoring Warrior is Barbosa with 11.`\My bad, guess I'm out of the loop`\Damn Klay, it's not gonna be like that is it?`\He's definitely contributing.  We didn't need the upgrade, but losing Thompson and gaining Varejao was pretty sweet.`\This is all just because Steph missed a layup and got mad.`\EZ`\if you're a hawks fan thats just gotta piss you off big time`\Brogut is a cool hunk`\I got Livingston getting 20/7/7`\Ernie is a national treasure. How many white dudes can govern a panel of former NBA stars while not coming off patronizing or awkward as fuck. They're all just black friends.`\Give Speights the max and we'll happily take Barnes. ��`\remember boys and girls... ball dont lie`\;)`\All good man.`\At some point Harrison is going to have to prove that he still deserves to be a starter.`\What a fantastic crowd`\Jason Thompson
`\damn looked at tht tough old skool defense ......`\Yeah, you better not fuck us up!`\Dubs already going small`\Foul for you! Foul for you! Foul for everyone! `\I could see that happening. It's honestly tough to guess they could finish the season 14-2 and it would not surprise me at all or they could finish 10-6 and it wouldn't surprise me.


It feels like every game the Warriors play they have a real shot at losing and the fact Iggy is gone for awhile and it's getting closer to playoff time. It makes me think they will lose some they should be able to win `\His 3 point shot is still off. He's shot 30% since the Spurs game `\I was like Barbosa you gave up a layup wtf but he found a Curry corner 3, gotta give that up for that`\Is Curry nursing an injury we're not aware of? Never seen him so hesitant against big men outside the 3-point line.`\But r/NBA says only the Warriors do it, so I should agree and get free karma!`\Warriors are playing awful right now and we aren't taking advantage`\Selective observation if there was such a term.`\Seriously. `\This is kind of a joke.`\Felton running 7 Donuts or Less`\DOES CURRY REALLY WANT TO GET INTO A 3 PT SHOOTOUT WITH BRANDON KNIGHT?`\We need to add that to the "shit the commentators say" thread`\got fouled there`\I'm trying to not feel the cringe but fuck it's had. `\I dont agree with sitting livingston there.`\Westbrook over Kawhi?`\THIS TEAM!!!! <333`\Wall never gets calls`\just a reminder we got [this gold](https://streamable.com/qsxn) from the last time these teams played each other`\That foul was weak af.`\I guess that's why Rush doesn't get many minutes.`\Bogut with the crazy eyes.`\Lol Clark doesn't want the ball`\What happened to that guy?`\Jason Thompson`\Uhh yeah? The season after Jordan left the Bulls won 55 games lol.`\What?`\It's Tuesday...`\You say it, must be true.`\Game of the year potential `\Draymond is just everywhere right now. Running the point, being the leader of the defense, making perfect switches, contesting everything.`\proof?`\Oh man poor guy, that was messed up`\Curry and iggy out but after that big big win Saturday they need and deserve it ��`\It's that type of Klay game tonight `\Maybe he knew if he'd foul, it'd be before the shot? That would be pretty smart if he meant to do that, knowing Klay would probably make it.`\Wittman :')`\r/quityourbullshit`\Lets not get too crazy`\Just checking in. Fuck the Clippers`\lol draymond SHAQTIN`\Draymond long 3? Bogut running a little point and even hitting that ISO on a play?

Even the Warriors know this is an easy win`\guess you dont remember the blazers warriors game`\Not even a big deal. No sweat.`\Good one`\¯\\_(ツ)_/¯ `\Great game. Can swing either way.`\If Wall was even a slightly above average shooter he would be MVP `\curry bruh lol `\Can we see at least one Livingston post up on Dennis in OT....`\SPEIGHTS!

GO FOR THE RECORD!`\Who's making a gif of that airball?`\Barnes dagger yeeaaahh`\Holy shit, that's Lou Amundsen! It looks like he spent 10 years in the gulag`\you're fucking joking me....he literally chucked that up!`\You guys are playing well. Hardly any turnovers, decent shooting. You guys had an off-night that night. The Suns are somehow keeping pace without exploiting the Warriors in some way. `\yeah i agree, he just seemed really out of place for like three offensive possessions in a row and then dropped a pass for a turnover. sometimes it feels like they try to force him getting involved, or maybe they see a mismatch i dont.`\Good foul, Orlando! `\That had no business going in. `\huge FTs here`\klay 15/5/5`\The bitch of all bitches`\Terrible shot by Matthews.`\Someone is mass downvoting`\Get that trash out you fuck`\Draymond lol`\if someone pays him the max I'm gonna laugh`\Steph shoots better from distance with a hand in his face. Crazy. `\Now we're playing Wizards basketball.`\KLAY THEY NEED YOU BRO>`\Well the Sixers are butt heads!`\Do the Warriors have to keep shooting threes? We get it. You can shoot. But it's starting to get embarrassing so please stop. `\Ezeli should be back this week. It will however give the team an insurance policy in case someone goes down. He is already looking comfortable on the floor with the different lineups he has been in.`\Well it was fun while it lasted`\What? I'm not saying he should win, I said he should lowkey be up there out of the contenders.`\Curry - "Here's my fuck you dagger"`\GOATBOSA WITH THE BUZZER BEATER`\LOL @ that Bogut reaction after the foul call.`\Who else could they play? `\oh he knows. thats why he just popped that last one no hesitation`\Well, there goes the first Trump campaign ad I've seen live. `\Livinggod`\This is the worst game awareness I've seen.  You're up 7 with 2 minutes and the ball.  Just kill the clock instead of trying the pass through the smallest windows.  `\WARRRRRRIOOORRRSSS`\Come on klay`\yeee get those FTs klay`\Barborsa ;_;`\Every time he's does something people will comment he can't do thing. When he does thing they comment about another thing and the cycle continues.`\damnnnnn`\Not mine.`\HOW THE FUCK DO YOU GET BLOCKED BY MO LOL`\Mine's the same shape of his, but for some reason doesn't get that long`\[Landry makes history for a brief moment](http://i.imgur.com/psqtpee.jpg)`\The key is to put the ball in the basket. It's pretty complex stuff.`\We are lollygagging`\He's also 6/24`\Didn't Holiday used to be a good defender? That's like the third or fourth time he fell asleep out there.`\Me too.... That's why it is so disappointing . He's just going to be a blip in NBA history.`\Hey man, you guys exceeded expectations this year... KP looks dope, Carmelo stuck around. Back away from the ledge...`\Props, Mavs.

WTF tho, guys.`\The Wiz bench honestly makes me want to puke`\I was like oh shit GS are in serious trouble going into the 4th quarter down by 10. Then I realized they're GS.`\I think it's just called a finish by Curry these days.

Don't get me wrong, I'm still not desensitized to the jaw-dropping things that his holiness, THREESUS - SKY FUCKER, routinely pulls off. I just don't think they're ridiculous because it's Curry. It's not what I expect from him, but I'm hardly surprised when he makes shots that are improbable.`\yes`\Klay stop being shit for like 1 minute`\If the Hawks want this W they need to put Teague back on the team bus`\Damn you millsap`\Bigger bailout than 2008`\Ah, there's the rant about the shoes haha.`\mo bucks`\and 1`\BOOKERRRRRR`\take tht hb`\Wow!

Wow!

Wow!

*chat disabled for 1 seconds*

What a save!`\Livingston, but his post game makes up for it`\Great defense from the Pelicans so far`\Curry is using his 2k layup package tonight.`\LMAO`\Yeah he is, whatever`\Pelicans are starting Toney Douglas and Alonzo Gee. Holy injuries.`\Mavs are missing 3 starters`\#I'M IN LOVE WITH THE MOMO`\Schroeder only plays good if Steph is in`\Ish gonna lead them to... the local BK for a consolation milkshake.`\maybe they should stop trying to post everytime`\3 pointers too`\That's what happens when you give Steph a whole .2 seconds to shoot a three.`\that's a morbid thought but I agree`\Now Mo is hot`\yea pistons and bulls won today`\fun while it lasted!`\I don't disagree, see how much he wants to break the record and lay him on his ass. We need these games ffs`\My thoughts exactly`\I really like ATL's jersey's `\As much as every Warrior loss warms my heart and makes me smile inside, even if they do lose (please) the fact is that they stuck with a top team for an entire game and led for most of it *without* their franchise player and another top star. It's just tough to envision how anybody wins 4 out of 7 games against them in the playoffs. `\AND ONE!!`\Probably will just be "fuck the clippers" and "fuck the Warriors" everywhere `\Not even low-key.`\2 games straight Varejao? `\TBH It still surprises me how well Draymond can guard big men who are much bigger than him. Chandler's got almost a foot on Dray. `\My favorite part of every Warriors/Hawks game is the random Brick party.`\I was told there would be cake?`\Could have played lance `\Should've been an and-1. `\Is it Looney time?`\Good D. Changed his shot `\Why does is our bench awesome in every quarter but the 4th.`\What the fuck is this game! `\Ah yea I got them mixed up`\Still, you guys did good. At halftime I thought it was gonna be a blowout, but you'd came back and made it harder for them to win. Sucks to lose, but a great core for you guys to have.

2. DAE Curry never gets calls
3. DAE Curry/Warriors gets every call
4. Warriors fan response to #3 sarcastically claiming thats the only reason we have our record.
5. Speights Yam
6. Warriors fans are degrogetory noun for crying about calls
7. Fuck the clippers/LA (edit)
8. Barnes miss w/ corresponding Rabsho callout (edit)`\No offense but Charlie looks like an ogre.`\if only dirk played... hope this is a first round series `\Mo clutch?`\I feel like they've been wearing the blacks almost every game. Home or away. `\Hacking the Warriors is just poor coaching that probably wasn't fully thought out, they'll go five out and be better than they were with a center.

Fuck you`\they couldve at least tried a pnr or something`\I appreciate how he doesn't play heroball, I mean it was a fuck up but I'd rather see him pass than make a shit attempt every play.

That place is rocking regardless of who they're playing in there. It's not even close to the second best in the NBA.`\MO BUCKETS`\In their defense, this is year 4 of good ball.

Why do I feel like you're going to commit a sketchy foul tonight?`\Stfu idiot`\At Least his GF Jay-qwellin is a dime.`\No lead is safe with this team`\Mo Money Mo Buckets.`\It was a travesty last year`\This presentation of the NBA on TNT is brought to you by Adult Swim.`\Slips into a foul lol`\"Get out of here, dammit" lol`\they're trying a little too hard to make this game close`\And one`\Gortat dishing dimes`\You can tell Curry takes it personal when the other team shoots 3's against him`\MO!`\Marcus Thornton looks like a fish`\I think it's safe to say Mo Speights is the greatest shooter of all time`\YAM FOR 3`\Millsap 4-16 Jesus dude`\This happens so many times during Pelicans games. Nobody plays defense yet nobody can hit a shot. Fucking boring man. `\Aside from a Curry three, nothing hypes up the Oracle crowd like a Bogut dunk`\Gentry's doing great with limited talent... would love to still have him on our staff.

That's gotta be it`\Just keep at it Curry, you'll find your stroke`\Dust off the Ark ,ma.`\Charlie going god mode `\Niiiiice`\oh boy`\We are the least clutch team in the nba.`\a lot of dudes would be (justifiably) angry about getting overshadowed by curry and draymond's lightning-fast rise. if anyone on the we believe team was in klay's shoes, they would have thrown a fit. `\37 point mode - off`\Droppin dimes`\Too soon JB`\Joints rolled and ready for some basketball.`\stop being shit klay.`\andy welcoming porzingis to the league lol`\Big Brazil getting to the line. `\Interesting to see green playing so much point on offense tonight`\All day, keep getting the ball Stpeh`\Anyone remember when Wall-Beal was considered as good a backcourt (and even better in some people's eyes) than Curry-Klay? lol`\Lmao curry`\Which will allow him to take a hometown discount for his next contract.`\the craziest stat i heard tonight is that curry hasn't had a 3 blocked all season.... not a single one. thats some shit right there`\So, on that Dray shot, was he noticing he has been hitting front iron way too much and was like, "PUTTIN THE LEGS IN THIS 1 BB!"?`\I think Harrison's main physical weakness is that he has small hands.`\Don't worry. It all starts when you swipe an all star somewhere like we swiped David Lee from you guys.`\https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5pD4nBabMk`\Curry is going into his "fuck playing the fourth" mode`\LET OLEKSIY COOK`\I could tell while he was at Georgetown he was going to make it to the league.

Interesting move. `\hes said hes not.`\No I'm just not trying to be too anti circlejerk because that's a recipe for disaster around this sub. Cp3 is easily above westbrook. When the clippers other star went out, they continued to win because of chris. Last year when kd went out, the thunder missed they playoffs while russ put up his numbers. Yeah he's a walking triple double but he'll turn the ball over and shoot 30%. Cp3 is efficient and careful with the ball and that's why you're seeing it transfer to wins. `\splash`\That Klay floater was hella nice.`\BOGUT!!!!!!!!!!!`\Sweet baby jesus that was nice`\These young teams play so well against the Warriors.`\When Steph starts to bank in 3s again you know the slump is over`\Horford giving out double armed shoves on those screens`\Ros broke up with him and he's trying too hard to be all like this is what you're missing but he's just embarrassing himself`\yay finally tnt`\Kurt Rambis `\Orlandoooo.

Maybe rest curry one then dray and klay. `\GG Atlanta`\Hes a NIMBLE NAVIGATOR`\Barnes starting over Rush makes absolutely no sense...

Edit: it appears as if all the hate posts made him go into curry mode. Rush should still be starting though, Barnes seems to play better with the 2nd unit `\?`\Did you really expect anything else?`\I really dislike that. Klay is a remarkable shooter in his own right, ask him about his 4-6 3's (same as Steph's) instead.`\Was that a block?`\What's the word on Iggy and Festus?`\mo buckets!`\Yep he did really good tonight for the kings. Hopefully they keep giving him those additional minutes.`\So we have to wait for the Cavs game to be over for tip off?`\ok to you too`\rush>barnes`\I didn't see your original post, so I don't know how you worded it, but there are enough people on these threads that advocate fouling to injure Curry that it could be interpreted as such.`\They play in Oakland and we are wearing the throwback jerseys`\just Fitz, cringeworthy sometimes.`\Jason Thompson

`\If I was a Hawks fan I would've jumped out a window by now`\OTTOMATIC BABY`\And-1-son Varejao`\what the hell`\Millsap choke on most open shot of the night smh`\Just like that one guy who bet $20 and won ~$50k after betting Germany would beat Brazil 7-1 and Klose would score between 20-30th minutes.`\dang Klay. aggressive on the boards`\BRANDON KNIGHT MADE ANOTHER 3

BRANDON KNIGHT MADE ANOTHER 3`\Dubs couldn't fucking buy a call. `\I'M IN LOVE WITH THE DOODOO`\Flop nation Bogut smh`\Hey, I like Carl Landry!`\Hawks are looking a little out of sync. Warriors have been playing solid defense and have been taking advantage on the offensive end, winning handily on both ends of the court right now.`\He was testing the waters lol`\Just looked him up. He's a former circus director whatever that means. Also Joe Mauer's cousin so that's cool!`\I think the playoffs are out of reach for us. We shouldn't risk them getting injured especially since we have a semi-winnable game tomorrow`\More spacing just makes everything in offense way easier. `\Cmon Hawks. Get up in there and fuck shit up. You're due for an OT win!`\We don't and it sucks. would rather see Dennis attack the basket or something just no more from Paul`\He meant it's not lucky.`\The Warriors can't hit anything `\Speights just swished a 3. End the game.`\wtf curry`\You had to write the raiders so small because you are scared to actually say fuck the niners`\id give it to dray. dude has been making plays all night`\I hope Dray gets all his confidence back after that `\He's going to have to against the Spurs. They'll try and hide Parker on him.`\eh`\Klay's cold games look really, really bad.`\Smart foul`\refs already helping out CP3 some`\man, warriors pull out quick`\Hate to say this out loud, but does anyone else think Suns orange jerseys looked better with sleeves?`\Hey now, the Steve Nash, Shannon "Cannon" Brown, Hedo, Warrick, Lopez lineup wasn't that bad...

^godwhydidihavetorememberthat`\Live by the three...`\they're just competitors`\I knew the Pels would lose this but I have AD on my fantasy team so I watched. Is this 3 losses in a row for Pels?`\Man, I held my breath on that half court shot. You just never know anymore with Curry lol.`\lol klay's 3 had no business going in, jeez`\felton still the GOAT`\God it's painful watching these Knicks`\Forreal his shits are soooo off`\and he frequently misses easy layups aswell.. `\Livingston all over Horford`\Klay is our second best post player`\rush channeling his inner curry`\the warriors on a roll now man :)`\Hopefully Harrison was taking notes`\he could if he had another player to assist and space out the floor so he can drive...

COME HOME DURANT`\Andy getting in on the mouthguard chewing.`\that rubber is the devil`\No doubt about that. Still, he makes Kanter look like a fantastic PnR defender.`\I don't think I have ever watched a halftime show at the stadium. End up wasting my time getting food and drinks. Looks like I don't miss anything.`\I think we expect too much from him cuz he's such an amazing player. But at the end of the day he is human and everyone's entitled to a bad day `\Love seeing everyone getting involved.`\"Fuck the layup" - Stephen Curry`\He has gotten shafted on minutes tho. He is in my mind the most reliable shooter off the bench but rarely gets meaningful minutes anymore.`\THJ is gonna have a big game. I feel it`\What's the word on Iggy? `\Toney Douglas is throwing this game`\There were plenty of Dubs fans in the game thread/post game thread for us too. I just assumed that it's a mutual understanding that both groups of fans want the other's team to lose, and are ok with that.`\His legs were also very wide and then got narrower before the hit.  I think the call must have had something to do with Ian leading with the elbow.  `\This is why we don't trade Knight for peanuts. He's only 24 too. `\Ball don't lie!`\He had a little hook 3 feet out`\omggg klay jesus`\Is there going to be a stream of this available at all?`\barnes is just terrible with offball movements`\he also used to be a complete ballhog that couldn't follow the flow of an offense

he's playing a much better complete game this season, eve though his scoring has dropped.`\I fucking love McAdoo's energy, sprints all the way up for the put back and all the way back.`\Is there any chance Jennings takes Elfrid's job? `\So Warriors miss Iggy that much huh.`\With Festus out and Bogut getting banged up a lot we needed another big body, especially since Mo was struggling when we signed Varejao. He's serving his purpose.`\No there are just more bandwagons`\Apparently he sets the nastiest pick in the NBA `\Warriors would be up 15 if Curry were playing.`\Harden caught napping on the front page is the only joy I'm getting for the rest of the night. At least Barcelona won today. `\Snapped it!`\I can see that.

Edit 2: tnx everyone, I'll take my exit now and shit on my internet provider`\That's how you play it, Mo!`\hawks: how far we done fell`\Without Iggy out for 2 weeks, every road game is suspect imo. I wouldn't be surprised if they lost two in a row against Mavs/Spurs this weekend but I don't think they will let that happen. I think 73-9 is the most realistic outcome. They'll more than likely lose the march 20 away game against the Spurs since its on the tail end of a b2b and then 1 or 2 more lull road losses (I'd pick Mavs or Jazz since they are fighting for playoff position and both those games are within B2B's)

I also think the Spurs might be the only squad to beat them at Oracle but by that point Iggy would have returned from injury so who knows. Another dark-horse to beating GS at home would be The Clips or Boston if Crowder is back by that point. To me those are going to be HUGE games in terms of breaking the record. I also have a feeling Pop is going to rest his starters the last couple of games of the season so that final Spurs road game will be a W for the Warriors. Worst case scenario 72-10. best case scenario 74-8.`\Steph's too unselfish`\Steph's back.`\thats why he's playing the 2 `\Curry is like the guy in wrestling who's been waiting for the tag all match long and then comes in and clears house.`\Aren't they the same thing at this point?

So a good shot against you will have a hand in your face but we kinda know a thing or two about your team, I suppose. And are getting some open shots...but we aren't hitting.

Understandable really. Cunningham, Gee, and Douglas? Good God.

End game transparency doesn't really solve the problem, it just puts a bandaid over it.

I'm not suggesting that they replay every single play either. But I'm sure there are methods to perhaps repay or challenge certain things. To be honest, I don't even know what the best way to fix the issue is. All I know is change is impending, at least I want to believe it is. `\Lol`\I think he just wanted to shove Crawford.

Nobody even said anything about it during this game `\been waiting for this game all week`\Kerr looks like he might Sprewell someone during the timeout. `\Gib MO 3's`\Well, Mo was a Sixer`\Ok now that we got that ring ceremony done there's nothing to see here anymore`\Dray 15/12/8`\Barnes you suck bro`\Everyone wanna be Curry`\Curry falling back 3pt prayer, makes it no one surprised`\These Polynesian drums are dope`\Shoe rant. Also Klay needs to do whatever HB does to be able to do the splits`\Dennis the Menace has to step up if the hawks want to win. He is a matchup nightmare for the Warriors `\Well, Millsap was more open at the end of regulation, Bob.`\/u/Rabsho approves. `\The whole team is lit. We ca n probably make the post game thread now.`\GET WALL BACK IN`\Love how they're showing an illegal screen as an example of a Golden State play...`\WTF was that screen`\Schroder!!`\finally found the right strain`\Because it is tied and they wanted to draw up a play`\GG what a close, crazy 3`\Lawler has such an old school delivery. A real classic.`\He's baaaaaaaack.`\Damn, that commercial actually makes me want to watch the 80s show on CNN.`\Lol you got a deal sucker`\come on dubs get it to the magic number 15`\fuck off bitchass refs`\lol hawks flop`\where's the $10 /u/ArminVanBuuren`\Rabsho and this Clippers announcer would not get along. (He is saying Barnes is the best 5th man in the league).`\Nawp`\Dang, that surprises me. If they don't like him, we will take him! I'd stomach Fitz just to listen to him AND JB. Frazier is legendary, not a clown in the slightest. There are other great announcers, I love Jim Pete for Minny, and the Raptors and the Heat both have great duos.. but I get cravings for Clyde. `\Mo is just fucking phenomenal! And Steph always reliable when we need him. Dude was measuring up the game on the bench you could see it from his eyes. `\check out r/outoftheloop`\Bogut is BALLING!

If the Warriors play with this kind of defensive intensity and ball movement nobody can beat us`\It's really sad to see Harden get free throws when he wasn't even fouled, then Wall gets hacked and gets 0 love from the refs`\And at end of the game it is more like 6 mins. `\Oh Klay`\It's like they forgot they were even working the 3rd quarter and now they're trying to make up for it. `\Really nice moves to the basket by Draymond Green and drawing the foul`\In remembrance of /u/handrewbrozel, I present to you all his favorite song, [$ara Bareille$' *Love Song*.](https://youtu.be/qi7Yh16dA0w)

Rest in peace, Andy, you will be missed. I know this is what you would've wanted. `\Well damn, where my arm at`\real talk, I could have made that layup tho.`\Draymond almost not ready again.`\You might wanna look it up before correcting people...I will never get this.`\Does anyone have a stream`\bogut is getting killed`\50`\holy shit hawks are throwing some lazy passes`\When did you guys get gong? Hope it was a cheap deal`\He's supposed to be, my educated guess is he comes back early April or so`\Should Morris be attempting like 6 threes?`\fuck his system and NBA ready I want the player who can be the best where we pick and I dont think thats him/`\He was staring off to the side of the court where no players were, so I guess it counts.`\Jason T`\the closest to do so was Andre Miller `\Millsap why?`\Mo really has improved all aspects of his game recently`\I was actually really happy with that defense`\Randy Wittman`\Going down to the wire it seems like `\My girlfriend wants us to go to the gym... And the guy who does the streams has finals... What injury can I fake that sounds believable and lasts 3 hours?

*edit* thank the basketball gods. She changed her mind. Thanks for the suggestions homies. ����`\Toney "Kevin Hart" Douglas is playing pretty good post defense. `\offense improved since the last time they played the Hawks (based on 1st quarter results), while defense suffered. Just more evidence that Steph is actually irrelevant on the offensive end, and shines as a defensive juggernaut. `\you think wrong...furthest thing from the truth lol`\agreed, that wasnt a foul`\my goodness we suck at passing`\I wouldn't even be mad. `\Wow, very original comment! How long did it take you to come up with it?`\Some more messy shit from the warriors.  `\THE KRIS HUMPHRIES ERA BEGINS`\If Dray was a 75-80% FT shooter he'd have what, 7 more points a game?`\Iggy used it all to clinch that @OKC improbable OT win. `\TMAC!

It's been due for us fans for the past 4ish years now!`\Ugh last thing I wanted to see right now was a Varejao mid range`\lol Tyson starts trying when we tie the game `\Get some Livingston post ups`\Well dang, I wish I'd tuned in earlier for this one. Looks like it's already over now. `\Probably won't get much PT in the playoffs would he? `\there's a game tomorrow`\naw, its why hibbert is a scrub now`\Mo has been an absolute beast these past few weeks`\man i want to see a series of both teams at full strength`\Curry is God `\We all do.`\This stream is cutting out constantly with balls in the air, yet of course it plays all the dumb shit like the McDonald's parachute drop flawlessly haha.`\Wow gsw always plays down to their opponent. Good thing this probs wont happen in the playoffs`\Klayyyy lmao`\Fucking hell Klay got mugged `\Mo has 20. My god`\This team is so fun to watch`\What the fuck? Fuck you `\damn brandon`\Oh dear korver is dam good`\Facking warriors!!!`\ORACLE IS TOO WET`\I can't believe Carmelo doesn't know why he's not getting rings while his draft class is. Watching this game will show you what happens when one person takes up your entire cap space. Scrub after scrub signings. He chased monies, which no one can blame him, but now he's wondering why he can't chase rings. `\CHARLIE FUCKING V AGAIN`\Here he comes! Klay is hot! `\Damn son`\300 THREES BY STEPHEN CURRY `\so it's going to be one of those games where we can just shitpost in the game threads (remember to tease the rockets fans in their game thread, they are losing really badly) instead of watching the game
`\like 100-0 or something`\heh`\C'mon Powel`\**EVERYBODY GETS A 3**`\With that 3rd quarter, I feel the Curry shot has ended for the night. `\It's Bill Walton part 2`\Ayy that chick behind Jim`\Can't beat Bogut. He's a hundred percent three shooter`\Yeah man, fuck curry.`\You have the inferior Kuiper.`\is there only one warriors flair or something?`\Three00th!`\You forgot trashing Barnes/Klay for literally every miss. `\should Bogut tryout for the 49ers QB job?`\Klay was asked why he has a short term memory`\It was a commendable effort boys, now go back to being the best at least something`\Crowd needs to be on their feet right now !!!!

`\Hoping for an earthquake free second half here.`\thats a good reason imo`\Movie exec 1: "Melissa McCarthy's been a spy, a southie, and just a generally pushy fat lady. What else can she do?"

Movie exec 2: "....what about punching kids?"`\That looked like back court`\Holy fucking BLURBOSA`\And it was an offensive foul. `\I wonder if Klay believes he's as good a shooter as Curry.`\Hate delay of gsme techs `\I know...just pointing out it was a pretty awesome`\I think 50 against Memphis? I could be wrong tho`\Love watching Wall/Gortat pick and rolls`\I am so sorry that these girls have to practice repeatedly to this song.`\Warriors 3pt % as a team has dipped significantly after the ASG`\1) Love to see the ball handling from the bigs- Varejao just takes the ball up court casually..

2) McAdoo getting significant minutes? TF? Love to see him cleaning up the glass. I hope he cracks the rotation in the future.

`\ He's barely legal, don't you even think about touching him`\He heard ya`\Devin Booker with the LeBron shoulder.  `\Warriors are only doing this to help secure the Bull's playoff position right? ^^^guys?`\They're at 90 points with 5 minutes left in the 3rd, jeez. `\Bernie Sanders 2016`\It never should have gotten to this point `\Smh r/nba has become a "fuck the clippers" submitting contest.

I get the feeling they just match up relatively well with Warriors and Warriors also aren't really taking this seriously`\Midrange BASELINE fadeaway shooter maybe`\I want "AYEE" and "AND 1" as text tones. `\WAIVE BARNES

MAX SPEIGHTS

LEAGUE FUCKED.`\I'm starting to believe the Warriors may not make the finals this year, they've looked extremely beatable since the break

Playoffs will be interesting`\"As if ~~millions~~ dozens of Wizards fans suddenly cried out in terror and were suddenly silenced."`\that was a long dump`\lol This is such bullshit... amount of PF's committed by both teams is about the same... if the game is being called badly it's being called badly on both sides`\LOB CITY`\Ian Clark or Clark Kent? you decide `\or on anyone`\i wonder what Clyde is saying on how to shutdown Curry`\Knight has absolutely no finesse with his lobs lol`\Ugly 4 TOs from Steph :/

Draymond's 3 three's the difference maker this quarter`\We should formalize this with nice words and start a twitter campaign to Silver. be like here  r/nba solved your problem`\Nah bro I haven't even dreamed about it 6 times yet. `\lol knicks`\AYO GIVE MO A BLOW`\BRUH LMAO`\Mo took a stroll on that last play haha.`\Draymond Green traveled on that still.`\Steph's missed free throws aren't even that rare anymore`\The Kevin Hart curse is long over.`\To be fair he calls and 1 when he makes them too`\Who just yelled Jamba juice ��`\GOOD SHIT JJ`\The battle between the top 3 worst coaches in this season: Kurt Rambis vs Byron Scott vs Sam Mitchell continues (this is in terms of not developing rookies properly and poor rotations with the lineups, along with their terrible and outdated systems being used).`\**LEAGUE FUCKED**`\State Farm, please end this Hoopers ad campaign`\What a mess. Dubs playing like the worst team in the league`\Shut it down McAdoo!`\whoever's piping that is a lucky man `\Going for the layup at 118mph`\It was 1 dank maymay.`\Whoa, went to check the boxscore and sports.yahoo.com is all different for me now.

It's more like ESPN, which I don't like.`\Yeah man, there's a lake near me that has bass year round and gets stocked with rainbow trout in the Spring and Fall. Bass are fun to fish for and the trout are good eating. As for what I do, I generally just enjoy some peace and solitude outside in the sun while I cast and retrieve a spoon. Or you go with a friend and just chat for a while. Every now and then I'll bring a beer, but I'm not too keen on getting ticketed by a park ranger.

Nothing quite compares to fishing saltwater in a boat of your own but I'm not at that level of achievement in my life yet.`\Even Curry is a QB now`\MOOOOOOO
`\Well,thanks a lot Lakers, you pissed them off. =(`\Klay Thompson`\Yikes, is Cole Aldrich always this terrible?? `\Eh, fine with it.`\If we break the Warriors home streak, I think I've peaked as a suns fan.`\I'm joking but it's just terrible coaching on the Suns' part.`\shit pass, or misread?`\With shitty stream quality, Mo and Landry look like clones.`\He's declining so much faster too. Idk if it's injury or whatever but 3 years ago he was the one player who took an MVP vote away from LeBron, and now he's barely putting up 21 on a lottery team`\Keep shooten dem 3s, baw`\I might just be really high but has anyone seen Mo Buckets this game?`\ahahahahaha`\It's even year Giants baseball. So excited!`\MO BUCKETSS`\That was a cunt pass wall `\That's true and since every game matters so much you guys must be on edge about 1st quarter foul calls`\Living da Dream`\wow refs`\Curryyyy ayyy`\Well he air balled it to end the quarter. So over 3/4th of the court I guess?`\resting starters in the 4th
`\Anyone switching between this and Gonzaga vs Syracuse? Sabonis is dominating `\Should start the bench against Memphis `\Knight is just not a good playmaker. Cute dribbles here and there, then turns over the ball. `\It's because he shoots it so flat.`\Oldschool Warrior fans are some of the best NBA fans in the league.

Then you get the Lakers fans from 3 years ago.`\Anyone got an And-1 count against the Warriors so far this game? Feels like 10`\How are the hawks so bad`\Curry making CP3 his bitch as usual.`\phhhh.... at least I live in an actual state :P`\lol all the warriors fans be salty`\I swear, every team plays their best game of the season against us. `\I still can't believe a direct comparison was made between splash brothers and wizards backcourt as to why they aren't 2nd best. Wall is an assist, then drive PG. nothing like Curry, whom can actually shoot a 3. but that doesn't mean they suck, just have a different style of play. hopefully Wall will work on his 3 during offseason.

just think of what could happen with Wall, Beal, and Kevin Durant. no more PG that is obsessed with his stats, but that will acknowledge KD's skill and assist, with Beal and hopefully Otto-Porter spacing the floor. but that's a dream for him to come home`\I'm talking about today, clearly I'm talking about this game in response to a fucking stat about this particular game. Good god`\there was another banker tht went in`\we...

eatin...

now...

fam...`\my god steph`\Andre is severely missed`\i remember my brother feeling similarly when he found out Lebron was a man of God. `\god damn i love watching these lobs to bogut`\Those are Wall's first FTs this game, and people disagree when we say he doesn't get calls lmfao, pathetic.`\Yeah he really stepped it up this whole game `\i think b.rush has 11 as well`\There was a guy somewhere else saying this game is proof Lebron is still the best in the league.`\Wow, I'm going to predict their last 16 games. Not sure if they actually beat the record.

So I am guessing they just miss the record. the record

What do you guys think?
`\Klay continuing his stellar play `\haha it's all good. i'm just pulling on your leg`\Warriors haven't played good defense tonight. The Mavs are missing their scoring talent but they are well coached and they just run their plays and get wide open looks almost every possession.`\DEAR GOD`\Draymond chill bro`\No matter what anyone says about him, I love Dray`\They must hate us or something.`\Ayyy!!`\Why not?`\Mo is so lovable, wears his emotions on his sleeve like a big kid. Berates himself for screwing up and enjoys himself when succeeding`\Kerr is totally a surfer acid dude`\Curry just doesn't miss wide-open anymore.`\James Michael "Jordan" McAdoo!`\Playing well would be a start`\Raining 3s`\15`\I don't think I've seen a more odd cold streak on 3s than what Jrue is going through right now. Career > 36% 3 pt shooter, but can hit a 3 to save his life in 2016. Really fucking odd.`\Only a Sith deals in absolutes`\dayam....WELCOME TO THE FUCKING SHOW!`\He's sick`\I'm going to say he'll be top 5 MVP candidate at some point.  Maybe even MVP.  I mean, he's 19 and this good?`\I can tell you watch a lot of Warrior games.`\Speights 3 ? Go crazy folks go crazy`\They do this a lot in games they're playing a scrub opponent. See the Sixers/Lakers games.`\I swear they had like 7 points with 5 minutes left in the 1st. Now at the end of the 1st they have 31!`\Please let there be a speights dkunk or a Curry "dunk".`\arbok hos`\Refs have no respect for the GOAT McAdoo`\Yeah like the Rockets...right?... right?! :(`\Threezus with the assist and Threesiah with the bucket`\Hyping for the half courter!`\poor ball movement...all ISO jumpers`\Jason Thompson`\This fucking game`\gg`\Curry is alive`\So what's going on in this game? Are the Warriors tired or are the Suns having a good game? Looks like a mixture of both?`\Speights was leaning...`\Ros is soooo beautiful `\Good luck, Wizards.  Looking forward to a good one with playoff hopes on the line.`\and one!`\BRush > CJ in the first.`\Harrison quietly picking up despite the hate for the past few games`\This is Curry, I wouldn't call it a prayer unless it was literally any other player shooting it lol`\Curry did the same thing to Wall last time except he dropped a trey`\i'm surprised that they don't do 10 car trains for cal games `\Good game. Warriors, much to the dismay of NBA fans, get away again. Nice try Phoenix. Would've loved it for Book. But it's the Warriors. Can't beat them in these close games no matter how good you are.`\Barnes has been utter garbage lately. His groupies have been really quiet.`\haha, love the Kerr high-five there.`\devin gonna be the next klay`\JB with the "Ball don't lie" line, lol that was great.`\Dray has been awful man. Can't believe we blew such a big lead but credit to the Magic`\Finally. Hopefully they will keep dropping now`\Fuck u Hawks you're choking `\This is what I think every time they give him game time. He just always looks so lost and contributes nothing.`\ayeeeeee`\I see two`\this is nuts`\Well you saw it, I saw it, probably everybody saw it except the refs ! No worries tho `\the balls on this guy`\Can't complain we did way better then I thought we would`\Falling for Varejao pumpfakes... `\You guys... Please`\Every screen in the NBA (except for Bobans)`\Looks like good D to me`\GG Suns. Fun game to watch.`\Trey Buckets!`\Pelicans are doing nothing but shooting 3s`\Wait I think inversely not fun = fun`\Fuck that, I want my boys to break their home win streak.`\DRAY AND 1`\Why the fuck is curry sitting out this long. He has only 4. He knows not to make anymore. You need him in there. Holy shit what is Kerr thinking `\"LEBRON" JAMES MICHAEL "JORDAN" SHAQ-ADOO`\Nooo! "we're getting the good Jeff Green tonight."`\Fuck fuck fuck i can't believe i stayed up for this shit show. Fuck these knicks clowns playing like they dont care.`\CP3 breaks own ankles, bricks own shot :D`\this is how you know you're a trash ref`\We've won 33 straight games if Klay scored over 25+ points,

Klay has 37 right now`\The Harrison Barnes splits [NSFL](http://i.imgur.com/IlBBQje.gifv)`\Something happened over the last month and he has completely lost it. Not sure if he is fatigued or what but his shot is flat and short most of the time. On the flip side, his driving game has gotten so much better.`\GJ villanueva lol`\ayy Barnes!`\> Warriors

> Curry

Overruled!`\What the fuck speights has 23 points on 9-13 shooting`\sweet jesus what is Fitz wearing`\Mo buckets is here to stay. After the first 2/3 of the season I thought any kind of consistency playing well was gone.`\For real I've got whiplash`\Depends on how Ezeli looks when he gets back. `\okay Dray, heads can roll, but not like that...`\rigged

rigged

rigged`\Steph with a deep 2`\Yes.`\Check his user name`\Saw that come through the feed and thought it had to be a glitch. `\I should have been clearer in my post I guess. I do follow the Warriors. I understand the reasoning behind the move, and knew that they needed help from a big man. Though admittedly, I didn't realize the depth of need because I underestimated the JMM injury.

 It was not so much *why did they do this*, but **why this fucking guy?!** because I don't like AV's flopping, always injured, ass. `\I can't believe what I just saw.`\i would like to know the average amount of times an NBA center hits the floor. i would then fully expect to see that varejao averages twice that.`\> Would've been a 20 point game if we didn't play ~~Barnes~~ **Clark** so many minutes.

`\Stop fucking fouling just for the trap wtf`\DJ has played Curry great. Won't let him get good looks from 3. `\That's the icing on the cake. `\Keef normally you pass really well but this is shit`\Stay Thirsty, Dub Nation`\I hope that 3 is the first of many from steph`\All of his shots have been good looks though. `\give Bogut the max and put him at the 3`\Seriously, I cannot wait to see the madness that's gonna unfold in the next few years.  Keeping a close eye on Wolves, Suns, and Lakers.`\Orlando feed just showed the Curry game winner from last year.. so many old faces- Tobes, KOQ, and a masked Dipo. Wow`\Last year?`\Barnes looks out of place on the Dubs...he can't hang right now.`\Curry playing fantastic defense thus far`\Fitz still holding onto the "Human Torch" nickname. `\THE YAM 3 IN A ROW!`\I haven't heard Jim Barnett that excited in years`\Absolutely, TNT Crew is #1 but Chauncey knows what's up`\Eh, Warriors announcers are ok if you can stomach Bob Fitzgerald. Jim Barnett is fairly impartial and insightful. But Clyde and Breen are on a different level.`\shootout`\man if knight really wants to take his game to the next level he really needs to know how to play off ball. why does he just stand at the three point line when he doesn't have the ball? like he literally didnt move the last 3 possessions booker had it. maybe he's exhausted?`\Whole team is on point right now. `\It's the dairy.

High protein diet.

Peanut butter, yogurt and bananas for breakfast.
Protein shake and yogurt for lunch.
Hamburger and chicken for dinner with lots of leafy greens.
`\Man john wall is fuckin bricking`\lol this adobe thing is awesome`\Fuck Draymond Green but god damn that block(steal?) was nasty.`\Filler for Ezeli `\You are right, he can deadlift 400 lbs.  http://www.cbssports.com/nba/eye-on-basketball/25207008/stephen-curry-can-deadlift-400-pounds`\KNIGHT MADE A 3

KNIGHT MADE A 3`\Yeah, it's 2016, what about the Changs, the Jacksons, the Guptas???`\28 fouls on the suns lmao`\lol millsap what an ugly ass shot`\Where's the foul?`\I agree, especially if you're not really competitive for the playoffs`\If the Mavericks drank Powerade^tm over Gatorade^tm, they might've won`\He didn't even look `\LMAO NIPPLEHEAD ON FIRE`\Yeah, me too probably.`\Draymond is averaging 4.6 TOs in the last 5 games. `\My god Klay at 5/20. At the worst time possible`\YEAH KLAY`\Wow. What a release.`\I feel like this Warriors emcee during the timeouts is a douche. Who wears sunglasses inside an arena`\You must not watch us very often.`\Nope, on spring break.`\Everyone cheering for Bogut to shoot the three.

"Shoot the j! Shoot it!"`\I doubt if we're ever gonna match that 9k 3s by the '14 Rockets `\bs refs`\Holy shit`\I'd also imagine curry is the perfect superstar to play with. He had a wide open 3 but tried to pass it up to klay.`\I remember. Those were great times. `\Is Nene gone next year? Please tell me he's gone next year. I hate watching him ruin wall and beal `\Rush is getting burned any time he goes one on one. I wonder if Magic will keep exploiting that.`\I think with the record that close and the Spurs on their heels, the Warriors will actually keep trying until they hit at least 70. At that point I'm sure they'll competitively want to go for 72+`\Melo's scoring regression is seriously sad. He used to be an absolute machine offensively `\I hate Crawford's style sometimes, just play stop looking for fouls all the time`\Lol. He didn't call that one. `\Weirdest alley oop ever`\super fast game`\DC trying to channel their inner Texas A&M`\Guys Im telling you. European here, and whenever Im watching Curry play, he lacks off. Watch this. fml`\Yeah but the Clippers are 3-0 against the clippers `\It bugs me so much that they won't just take the shot anymore`\I just dont get it anymore.`\Can't wait to see Kawhi and Durant on the same team. Best wing combo since Jordan and PIppen .`\Against any other team I'm praising Curry for that shot but fuck him. FUCK THE WARRIORS FUCK BASKETBALL. `\How spoiled `\What a drive by KLAY!`\How did Klay get the call on that lol. `\Good god, it's like the rim gets smaller at the end of games for the Hawks`\lol omg`\FUCKIN CURRY!`\Steph would usually hit those wtf `\wow`\MO BUCK3TS`\Go Magic! Off topic but I'll be at the Amway center later this week and I'm super stoked to see another NBA arena `\Can we see a replay of that 4th curry foul. Because of that we are in this situation. I don't think he even touched the guy. `\1/2 of them for sure`\i imagine miley cyrus on the wrecking ball, instead fitz swinging on Booker's balls and crashing walls`\NBA 2k player of the game is Draymond Greeeeeen`\:(`\Luke Walton needs to go nuclear and start screaming and jumping up and down.

Maybe that would wake up the beast, lol`\Like last 5`\Please no stealth tanking.

Anything but this`\Noooope`\What did it say before he edited it?`\Im glad i stayed long enough somehow to see that shot`\Lmao Gortat sounded like a super mutant when he yelled "and 1"`\Alex Len almost has a double double wow. Everyone talking about Devin, they're sleeping on Alex`\You'd think this would be a bit closer.`\Klay is colder than liquid nitrogen right now`\GG`\I would have picked him over JT 1000/10. Varejao has provided some points in non-garbage time, which was a unicorn fallacy for JT.`\NBATV never has games on Wednesday, the little leaf next to the NBATV logo there means it's only on NBATV Canada`\clippers bench is good`\Drives the floor ��`\lol`\I really like how we are playing right now. This is incredible to see how everyone is in sync with each other. Fun half so far. Don't care if we lose. We have Len and Booker `\92%`\So he'll be ready for the playoffs then. `\The Yam is evolving`\I've never wanted anyone to take out another man's knees lol.`\Like giving him energy for a spirit bomb`\damn, shoulda been a foul`\I'm telling y'all, this is another example of Steph Curry being hidden on defense, he's getting completely fucked by Wall

he's a good help defender, but look at this matchup`\I miss Kenny, Chuck and Ernuh`\Mm I love me some Ros`\plus it would be great momentum for playing GSW`\Barnes heard y'all haters`\Ugly shot but it works`\Warriors fans are pacing around the TV like

>The fuck is this?`\When Dennis Schroder was drafted and I saw he was from Germany I expected him to look like the kid from Silver Spoons.`\Did Steph just hesitate?`\DAE think Dray should've got Td up, tho???????? I think I saw him shake his head or something. Uh. And moving screens.`\Damn, Warriors. Back at it again being the Warriors. `\GET WHATCHA NEEEEEEEEEEED`\not a fucking bulls fan`\man dray getting these rebounds on AD `\good for klay.`\Thank god for Morris's hustle `\Hahaha made em both`\My thoughts exactly.

edit: two nice plays`\What a nice 300th three!`\Horford is garbage.`\8/27 really isn't good. He hit clutch shots at the end, but in a holistic sense, not a great performance from him (Millsap too).`\NO WAY LOL`\The "it's not" I think was in regard to the part of the sentence you cut off, which was something like "If you think its luck that he made that"`\HAHAHA OTTO YOU LANKY MOTHERFUCKER YOU`\SAVE US MO`\He's watching greatness.

I hope the offense catches up soon.`\Anyone want to link me to a livestream? :)`\klay is playing because they need to rest the old guys`\Agreed`\lol kerr`\Barnes...ramming your head into a defender while taking a shot is inadvisable.  Good dunk tho.`\Solid first half from the clippers. Keep the ball movement going, keep hitting shots and we'll have a good second half, Paul won't stay cold the entire game.

It's a shame cause his defense is really good.`\Phoenix bench really hates Andy lmao`\bdd`\on nba.com's stats. what is BA?`\I think the spacing is less when you only have to focus on one sniper.

So the only games he'd miss against contenders would be the Spurs and the Clippers (who won't have Blake). Honestly, I think they can easily beat every team that isn't the Spurs, and I think they they'll definitely win at least one of those.`\You gotta be trolling`\Bounce backkk`\FUCK`\fuck yeah beal`\nice, thanks `\Klay smoking too much weed falling asleep constantly on those back doors.`\And the Lebron for most convincing flop goes to....`\This should be a fun thread `\16 turnovers damn.`\/r/nbastreams

SHOOTOUT`\Dont worry about the downvote, no big deal.

I personally think considering his role, he has put up just about what you expect. He is basically the 4th option on the team. I can see him getting to 15-17 ppg next season but the way the current roster is playing, he might not get more than 10 shots per game.`\wait so that's a fucking foul for FTs? wat.`\Yay free dubs call`\First 3 for Curry!`\It's not even close.`\Lol!`\who the fuck are you?`\i need to get a devin booker t shirt jersey`\He destroyed Derozan in the playoffs

Atlanta's not nearly as cool as I thought it would be, tbh.

It's a great city, no doubt. But It's not as cool as DC or BMore.

For southern cities, it's far any away the best, but DC/BMore/Philly/New York are all cooler places.`\What was with Jennings backing out of a layup?

Classic DC basketball.

At least we still have gogo music.`\LETS GO HAWKS COME ON`\He was great in the first half, second half not so much`\It's ironic that the 70s Knicks were so good when that decade is regarded as the trashiest, filthiest decade of NYC history.  This team now embodies the city during that era.  `\Good move but stuffs himself on the rim haha`\This is good, we need to keep losing. Randy can't be on this team next year. A new coach is gonna make such an unbelievable difference. I know it.`\"I guess he hit him in the face, I don't know?" ...seriously?`\korver boutta get a lot of matches on farmersonly `\FREE BASKETBALL`\If klay was more consistent I think he could give steph a run for his money in the mvp race.


Edit: Obviously it's too late for that now, I meant a full season consistent klay, things is klay peaks at such a high level it's difficult to imagine he maintaining 37 pts quarters for the whole season in which case he wouldn't be in the mvp convo rather in the jordan goat convo. `\the worst part about that barnes moving screen (grab really) is that the official was staring right at it. amazing.`\On national tv`\Needs more fiber`\barbosa was all like telling him to calm down`\Ahh, to be young again. And also a robot.

Anyways, welcome back dude!`\He's not a player we deserve, but he's the one we need right now. The one to shoulder the blame for the missed shots and poor decisions. He is the Enigmatic Rotation Player. `\What you are seeing right now is death ball lineup 2.0`\You choose tonight to say this?`\nope`\You should be happy the Warriors are introducing people to the sport! I've had a LOT of fun watching the Warriors. I got my mom into it as well.

My mom had surgery on her ankle and she was on the couch for awhile. We watched Warriors and bonded a lot. It was a very special memory I will cherish for the rest of my life. I got her tickets for her birthday and it was an amazing night. It was a huge outing after her surgery and it was a symbol that she was better.

There's nothing wrong with us bonding over that. I'm sorry so called bandwagon fans are annoying to you, but you should be happy that the Warriors are so entertaining to make non sports fans interested!`\WOW that was such a nasD steal`\Lol of all the fucking shots!`\You know? This Warriors team might be pretty good.

Well, better than the Nets, at least.`\Nasty amount of airballs.`\BARBOSA WITH THE EASY LAYUP.

Curry sort of open.

Save us. `\does any warriors fans here know your sidelines reporters phone number? I think I'm in love `\Nah, he's totally on the sax. `\full court press lol`\Don't remind me of what could have been `\Time and time again I manage to convince myself that the Warriors are in trouble and then I remember Steph is Steph.
