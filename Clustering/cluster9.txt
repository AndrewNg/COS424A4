Love has more offensive moves on his arsenal though `\4 year "team consultant" at the very least`\Did Bron just steal Lues booster seat?`\Russell making that same end-of-the-year push to make the All-NBA Rookie 1st Team that Clarkson made the year prior.`\I've been counting both. They're not synonymous with each other. The kids can still play great and lose. I will be upset if they lose the pick though. The WORST season in lakers HISTORY should net us a top 3 pick. And this has only been the second tank yr, not the third. If you like what you're seeing from the kids right now, just imagine a shiny new Simmons or Ingram next to them. Plus the potential to sign close to 3 max contracts or fill the roster with quality NBA talent. Don't worry my friend, the time for losing will soon be at an end `\Agreed. It's going to be hard to beat GS when they have the best player in the world.`\Melo is a sick motherfucker man.

Fucking hell.`\The role players just thought LBJ was going to do everything for them. No one seemed to want to do any work.`\"After you!" "Oh, no, no, after you!" "Oh, please, after you!" "Don't be too kind now, after you!" `\Dirk and Anderson are in! `\so mozgov is gonna go 2001 shaq on us?`\Smart please, there are times you need to tone it down a bit.  Pick your fights.`\This will be my first Lakers game thread this season I think :|`\they have elton brand and carl landry that kind of bring up their average I'd assume`\exactly how hot are the clippers? so hot that deandre jordan is even shooting 60% from the ft line`\Looks like the black Mr. Bean in this photo`\It's neither a good or bad contract.  It's a slight overpay for a guy who gets you a ton of extra possessions every game and plays great defense on the pick and roll and is a pretty good post defender now.  People throw out his $82 million contract like we should be expecting him to get 20/10 statlines when the Cavs are never expecting that and that's not what he is on the court to do.

He is on the court to grab offensive rebounds, get fouled trying to get offensive rebounds which happened at least 5 times last night which don't show up in the box score, have the other team have to throw extra bodies in the paint in order to slow him down which limits their transition game, play great defense which he is a top tier pick and roll defending big in the league and is improving on the block.  His offensive game has also improved and he is great at running towards the rim and finishing high above the rim as well.  He's shooting 58% on 5 attempts a game this year and his FT% is at 62% so he isn't as much of a liability at that end.

But sure, keep looking at his box score stats without being able to think critically to what he brings outside of stats.  He's your classic garbage man and I can guarantee that every team in the league would want him on their roster and all of them would have signed him to his contract if they were in the same situation as the Cavs.  He's also 24 years old.`\Good lord.. CP3 pulled Kyrie the fuck back.`\Simple: Our shooting percentage was low last game. That's literally the only reason we lost.`\This game has more ups and downs than a stripper's booty`\What were clyde and breen cracking up about, I barely heard what was going on, but it seemed like it was really funny`\We literally have only power forwards and wings if you don't count Ryan Hollins as a basketball player. Which no one should do.`\heh just ask clippers fans about him`\No doubt, he along with LeBron are the guys Cavs can't trade`\I am meeting him next week, I shall investigate`\Marcelo Huertas:  The most interesting Laker in the world

Huertas scored on Delly...when Delly wasn't even guarding him`\Damn that's poetic`\Tank `\I think the technicals for hanging on the rim are more for after a player dunks and is trying to be a badass. Lebron was doing it to not fall so him hanging there wasn't really bad sportsmanship, just sort of odd...`\That's fair enough, to each their own I guess.`\Oh God are they the Rams now`\Ref dick fits nice and snug in Cav ass.`\yeah but are good at falling down?`\Am I the only still waiting for that elite Kyrie breakout game this season? He's usually good for like at least one big game a season but it's like he's been frustrated all year because he's taken a step down from his usual play all year. `\Hickson hasn't been bad`\that kobe shimmy is gonna have 3000 likes on reddit lmao`\God damn we were terrible from the arc this game.

Stay tight, Buddy, we comin`\Children tend to act childish I guess.`\I can assure you that as someone who has browsed this subreddit for nearly four years that is certainly not the case. Many people dislike Gilbert as an owner and the Cavs' multiple number one overall picks that occurred when LeBron wasn't in town to the point where there was definitely some resentment towards us. `\update from the Wizards medical staff: john walls career is over :(`\brandon going for a tackle?`\Any news on Clarkson?

Sorry if this has been asked already `\Lebron getting his trade value up`\He gave up on defense on that previous possession and gave Young a free offensive rebound and bucket, too.`\We're gonna have to forfeit a game soon Jesus Christ`\He's been wonderful for us. Scoring 15-16 a game off the bench. Fits in with the team well also. I like him. `\The LeBron effect`\Alley oops`\Maybe they should have changed up their game plan. Its not like they were shocked to see Don Nelson on the other bench. But go ahead and keep pretending that being the only team EVER to lose a 7 game series against an 8 seed in the first round isn't a choke job of massive proportions.`\I think the right word is that hes a "front-runner." Dont necessarily agree with it but it I feel like he performs incredibly well in blowout wins and close games to klove are like water is to the wicked witch.`\God damn I'm gonna miss Kobe`\Honestly Byron is a genius. Giving the tank a break so he can boost team morale during these dark times.`\Let him shoot it every possession for the rest of the season, I'm on board.

Career game, and we still almost lost. `\I know.  We look like a real, live, professional team out there.`\I love our guys.  There's some great local announcers on league pass that compensate the shitty ones, the crews from the Knicks, Brooklyn and Toronto for example. `\If there's anything Cleveland is good at, it's keeping kids in school. #gradesAREcool`\I think we had like 25 turnovers or something, shot really bad from three too. `\Yes `\> COLBY! `\Mostly they got good looks, but everything was short. Honestly, they looked dead on their feet in the first and fourth quarters. My theory is that they celebrated Ky's birthday last night after getting to NY. Either way, it was a shitty effort all around (sans Lebron, of course).`\It's definitely bailed us out of a few bad possessions there too.`\This is like a boss fight`\96 was a good year for lakers, why not repeat in 2016?`\I think after his injury Kyrie just might've gave up on defense as a caution perhaps idk. He just doesn't have the heart he had last year. `\I love happy LeBron`\ Lue looks so fucking funny at times lmao.`\Maybe cause Lebron coasts a lot on defense so he knows that would be hypocritical `\Ryan Kellys a woman!`\you'll see, you'll all see. next year when KP comes back and finishes all those moves you'll all be sorry.`\When Cav bench is on,  wow!   Conversely, the clips are overmatched when the other team bench (any team) is lighting it up.  Another grueling playoffs for the Clip starters unfortunately.`\Mozgov is so bad...

Edit : okay I see you Hibbert`\U WOT Lebron`\Yeah Cavs, can you fucking hit your shots like this on the regular? thx.`\I'm not, but the lakers guard defense is beyond awful`\I wish they the big three heated up at the same time, not taking turns.`\Randle with the 13pt 14/5/1/3 statline. Sexy.`\Delly with the flop boy`\#20K WADE`\lots of runs for both teams`\I don't give a fuck if Lebron went to Arizona and played some spring training games with the Indians during the break. If he thinks it can help him out going forward and into the playoffs he can workout wherever he wants. `\jon barry is shit`\Makes sense that they're bottom 10 in 3pt shooting. `\Not even 24 hours ago hahaha`\Why the FUCK did they foul cp3?!?!? DJ WAS RIGHT THERE!!!!  Cp3 missed a free throw so I guess that's alright.`\At the game it looked like LeBron flopped to me. `\exactly. a lot of people seem to completely dismiss it. the same can be said for damian lillard (yes I'm a homer but it doesn't mean it's not true). damian has CJ Mccollum and that's really it.

teams dare Aminu to shoot, Vonleh can't score, Harkless can't score if it's not putbacks or assisted lay ups/dunks, Plums can't score, ed davis can't score

people don't realize how much attention guys like John and Dame get compared to several other point guards`\born_ready23`\Randle is our best 3 point shooter so far tonight at 1 for 2. Nobody else has made more than 1 for 4 or 0 for 3. That's not gonna win many games.`\In a scenario where there's no possible way to win the finals, I'd be down with the Heat beating us with Wade starting off the series averaging similar numbers on similar volume as Lebron did last year and losing the first two games, then lowering his shot attempts and the Heat finishing 4-1. Imagine the shitposting lol. `\Salty Seahwaks fan?`\Kobe looks like a proud father right now`\.......

:(`\Have you tried jerking off less? Maybe that'll fix Randle's woes around the rim.`\Lmaoo I think that sums up Reddit as a whole to be honest. People freak out  when they run into a complete level headed response instead of some sort of dumb joke. `\gg`\Passing to him in the post will suffice. `\Hibbert duck-in too deep, drew the foul. Shaq used to always do that`\/queue Griffin commercial for Cleveland`\Cavs haven't score since the 6:15 mark of the 4th quarter.

( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)`\Dlo learning from Kobe`\JJ THE DAGGER.

The first half of the season, when all the pieces were there, they were complacent, and let's face it, lazy. Take away a few options, tell them they can't do it, and BOOM, they start playing.

Next season, I'll kick one of them in the shins before the first game if that will help.`\yeah, Lebron was awful tonight... 28/11/8... that would be a career game for every player on Boston... just sayin.`\That works really well lol`\HUERTGOD`\I thought LeBron was trying to pass that to the corner and I got really confused when he went behind the back and I didn't see the ball`\I can't wait for whoever your guards are to drop 80 points tonight `\Are they seriously dissecting a tweet on air.... good shit ESPN`\Yeah man those refs suck!

I'm glad russell is working out `\yeah k love just doesn't make shots that he should. it's kinda that simple. he's weak in the post and almost always gets it stripped away`\man I went fucking crazy on Bradley's shot last game... all I can hope for is to be in that position again. Cavs definitely will come out focused`\...you can just walk up to them from section 100s?`\God I love ZBo. Make that man mayor already.`\Anyone have a stream?`\I guess LeBron is going to keep chilling on the bench

edit: nvm`\Just need to fill the SF and Center holes with some free agent talent and I think we would be in good shape. HB and Whiteside would be ideal I think. `\Still think his back problems are worse than we know.  He rarely leaves the ground anymore. `\Wonder why doc has gone away from prigs running the point off the bench. Jamal and Austin handling the ball is a recipe for failure`\Still fouls a lot, on both ends of the floor. Has PnR potential tho

Bass still our best PnR big, Hibbert still the best rim protecting big`\At life.`\That made me very very happy. `\It was back and fourth till the 4th. Only a 8 point 4th quarter lead till you pulled away last few minutes it was pretty closer than score indicates `\ooooooh ian...`\"Disappointing"`\CP3 saw Alex is still on the court and ran straight to the locker room. Haha.`\time to give my annuity, my car, my house, thanks Tristan`\Holy crap they're talking about us!  At length!  Even though Shaq called Marc "Pau".  Is okay!`\"steal"`\Kyrie is the Lance Stephenson of point guards`\Very up and down game, in the 2nd quarter the Cavs had a 18-2 run then the Mavs had a 19-2 run. This pretty much repeated in the second half. `\No Shump...you were not shooting.`\Bjelica could fit with almost anyone. But realistically hopefully we get a nice piece in the draft, since I don't think Bazz can be a big contributor off the bench if we ever get to the contention category. `\2 PGs, 2 Centers and a SF? Ok Randy `\when he asks you what is love, tell him it's Marcelo Huertas`\alright celtics and cavs fam, im ready to get nasty`\Wade and Bosch are both all star type players who can take over games. Wade was a starter this year. And what has Kidd done as a coach? Nothing. Spolstra is a way better coach than Kidd and way better the Lue could ever hope to be. `\in the Khaledian sense of the word`\has the "jr" always been spaced awkwardly on nance's jersey?`\Holy shit this is awesome.`\UNDERDOG PUT THAT ON A T-SHIRT`\I mean low lights are only good when it's a top player

So, yes, alternate timeline.  `\Shut up Doc, not close to a foul.`\His Real Plus Minus which adjusts for opponents , teammates and  lineups ranks  90th among SGs.

Don't let it happen again tho :P`\Lost by 30 in the season opener against the Cavs too`\Ayyyy I always see you going for the Rockets in the game threads  so I'm going for the Cavs this game. Wooo!`\Sasha Kaun, 1 minute, got blocked once and made a turnover haha`\No PorzinGod tonight =(`\And LeBron James is? rofl`\looked like a charge tbh`\Lakers win, brought to you by Julius Randle's huge balls.`\Mudiay is also playing much better defense. Nobody thinks mudiay is a better shooter than Russell, nobody. Also the turnover comes from taking way more risks in passing. John Wall averages more turnovers than Russell and they are both shooting 42%. Clearly Russell is the better player.`\man i dont want a moral victory`\Great game, grizzlies. Clutch Carter putting it away with the free throws.`\I deleted one comment and then made a new one`\this. especially since he seems to always hit them vs us for some reason`\Yeah, you realize our two best players are out.

I'm about 99% sure they don't exist, and if they do then they don't understand basketball.

Just when they are talking about the Clippers.

When Blake returns this is apparently the best team of all time without question.
Oh and I'm pretty sure they compared DJ to Bill Russell numerous times in the first quarter.

`\Damn, didn't necessarily expect a W, but a blowout ... Not to downplay the Cavs, they played well, but some Clippers played straight up terrible!


The stars of both teams played well, not disappointed in CP3 and DJ. And on the other end LeBron and Kyrie played great.


From the other starters, JR Smith was shooting very well tonight, while Jeff Green was on one of his off nights again. Luc Mbah a Moute was a good defense presence, but he keeps lacking on the offensive end.


The Clippers bench got totally outperformed. Channing Frye shot very well and Tristan Thompson dominated over Aldrich. Meanwhile Austin Rivers wasn't playing very well and Jamal had another off night, but still kept chucking up shots.


This game showed clearly that while the Clippers have been playing very decently without Blake, we need him against tougher opponents for his scoring ability.`\Yeah I think he misunderstood you. People constantly shit on Austin carr (the raspy sounding guy)`\lmao this subreddit is so butthurt you can't even write lebron is good`\Holy shit Hibbert is so fucking bad`\I love watching streams. At this time of night it's like having NFL Redzone. Got to see Pacers-Spurs, Wolves-Hornets, and Cle-Mem all at once.`\.....He already has a double double at halftime. How many rebounds do you want?`\I told you to watch out for the bunny...`\LMAO MAVERICKS`\Did Lebron smack that in himself?`\I wish I could watch a team of 5 Lance Stephensons because they would all be PISSED that they never got the ball.`\I really hope the Grizzlies upset in the first round of playoffs. It would be amazing to watch.`\DLo is out for the rest of the game

Bruised shin

`\Hey I know you from /r/NFL `\LOL No realistic argument from Lebron.`\Wow refs just fucked us.`\Nuggets need to spend a lot of time at a layup camp this offseason. Missing layups has been a common theme this season.`\ugly ugly ugly basketball `\What do Lakers fans want out if this game?? `\respect man its nice to have you here!`\He's still recovering from knee tendinitis. Apparently he's not at 100%.`\Wow bailout call `\Dream team is in!!!!!`\I am wise when it comes to NBA. Don't question the master ! ;-)`\Huertas knows how to get his teammates going, which is one of the most important parts of being an elite PG`\Legit looks like 08 Kobe out there`\"Nope boss...plum out...dropped all of 'em"`\Kind of agree, but was excellent prior to that. Both kept the defensive mistakes to a minimum, and even made a couple of good plays on that end, so just off that it was a good two way game`\As a Dodgers/Lakers fan in Florida this is my life. You get used to it. `\Cause we beat the Warriors.`\I'd hope someone as young as 31 could still move around and run pretty quickly. If not.. yikes.`\LOL`\A-M-A_Z-I-N-G`\Lopez reminds me ever so vaguely of Beavis`\Well I'm looking forward to the eastern conference playoffs, first time in awhile Lebron will face adversity to reach the finals.`\Better delete that comment before this blows up downvotes for days `\Just because he put up his usual numbers doesn't make what I said any less true.`\Mickey will continue his 30+ PER after tonight. `\Lmao thats my d wade :')`\This Mirza game winner will make me salty af. `\Why haven't you changed your flair?`\If the second half is anything like this one, this is an instant classic. I'm losing my shit haha`\Whew thought it was acl for a second `\Which is what makes me laugh when people act like finesse teams would have a bad time in those eras. Last time I checked, scoring is actually harder to do now than it was in the 90's. `\JR Smiths release is fucking butter`\Cavs forgot they had another half quarter to play.`\Anybody got an HD stream? There's nothing good on r/nbastreams`\some guys sitting besides miley courtside. apparently he was talking to her and she was ignoring him or something lol`\weirdest game calls ever.. for everyone `\"perfect pass"

its was right at RJ's knees rofl`\As much as i hate to say it, he's not technically a basketball player right now. His time is mostly done, i mean, he's 36 years old. He's had a good career tho, and won a championship for us.`\If the Cavs can somehow get the championship this year, gif is gonna get real`\[HOIST](https://streamable.com/4uq1)`\I hope you're right.`\Have fun man.`\Looking forward to seeing Kobe retire and not, weird feelings.`\bruh`\the fact Lakers have more offensive rebound then heat LOL`\what did he say about him?`\Lebron clowning now `\That was nearly a perfect game by the Cavs, it seemed like they hit 25 threes or so, and if they missed, TT got dem offensive rebounds. And Jr Smith hit like 5 360 no scope threes damn, great game by Cleveland.
edit: except for Mozgov, he plays like he has butter on his hands `\Gonna need to hit some of these.`\i like lebron shoes tonight`\Taking donations man?

I wanted miami to win or for Russel to get the game winning shot.`\I mean, you guys can still drop to the 4th pick and lose it to the Sixers. The Knicks were in the same situation last year with the 2nd worst overall record. `\Oh shit.

`\Matthews ... points ... BAHAHAHA`\Dirk's shit is clean cut now tho

Love needs to fall in line`\these refs are fucking horrible`\https://twitter.com/MiamiHEAT/status/711367568259424256`\Game should be over

Edit: i rest my case `\I feel so privileged to watch this game`\definitely confidence issues. He can hit those, but he just passes too much and doesn't drive much. it'll work out when he gets more minutes.`\fuck yea Nance playing some great D`\#BACK TO BACK

Our young trio got 74 points. Can we never play Lou Will again!?`\> Why can't ~~we~~ Amir Johnson make free throws tonight`\He hit the 3 better last year as well as seemed to sort of fit into a role where he would always be in good position when he took shots instead of trying to force it whether or not he is.  It was more controlled black hole instead of uncontrolled black hole`\I mean, yes.  But he's LeBron James, who is (not) arguably one of the best basketball players in history.  That's what he does.  Guys like Love, Kyrie are very good, but they aren't on that level.  It's like comparing Love to Michael Jordan or KAJ, it just doesn't really make sense to do.`\Didn't play at all.`\Saw that.  Didn't like how Shumpert flopped on the next possession `\Huertas is making everything happen for the Lakers`\MARCELO HUERTAS MAKES US LOOK LIKE A GOOD BASKETBALL TEAM`\I wish jc would make the shots he usually does, he's so cold tonight. Lakers would be up`\I am talking about Wall rookie year. Can't compare a prime Wall to a barely 20 year old Russell. For as much hype for Wall as a rookie, the hype for Russell might have just grown a lot because of his performance  yesterday. `\If that were JR or Delly, /r/nba would be screaming for an ejection.`\Lol Delly got crushed.  `\I can't pretend like LeBron isn't the best player in the world. `\Kobe had traumatized me...anytime insee someone go down and grab ankle i think achillies`\http://i.imgur.com/pYek1ec.png`\Roy's got that money 16 footer`\What's the line on 'now give this guy a lot of credit'?`\I like the C's jerseys, very similar to the classic ones but more modernized! Do they wear these often?`\DAM SON EVERYBODY WET`\Lol I love it`\Holy crap I'm so excited to see JaM get more and more minutes the rest of the season. This is like the silver lining for our season.`\Time to weep`\We're gonna be in the bonus with them hacking like this`\Bogdonavic with that sneaky old man game `\He did the same to Whiteside. Helped him up instead of gaining the advantage. Whiteside proceeded to defend him on perimeter and block him lol. `\Like i said earlier, i understand supporting your team but you could show SOME kind of emotion off a play like that lol`\Curry's paved the way for today's chuckers.`\Sessions doesn't even BOTHER to reset the play. There were like 5 Cavs players in the paint.`\Should have kept wiggins`\Because history.`\MARCELINSANTY`\Lol Frye is having the game of his life`\Touche haha`\nah we're good.`\yo it's old AI`\Heading to the game. Go Wolves! `\can you imagine if tommy cast this game for the celtics instead of the GOAT? jesus christ`\More like Dim-Wittman hahaahha`\It depends on his defense next season `\We got a good deal, I think. Uncle Jeff was too much of a roller coaster. One night made you pull hair out, then the other would lead the team. Kinda strange but he's still doing in it LAC `\jr gonna decide how far the cavs go`\well, hopefully next year we can bounce back and have some some luck injury wise`\That made me laugh and then frown real hard`\What the Frye?`\there we go ATL`\That rim had a family JR!`\20000`\The whole league does `\Hell yeah!`\Subs in, gets YAMMED on, then immediately gets subbed out. That's ICE COLD!!`\I prefer clips over memphis but I understand

thank you again for keeping the Pacers at bay!`\Crying?  Really?  They're being real as fuck.  Dogging everyone on this team.  `\He's got that president aging progression. Lebarack O'balla`\One of the few times I am actually glad I stayed up to watch the Nets this season, if only for Russell and hearing the YES announcing team talk more about tacos than the Nets.`\Loving this D, so glad the Grind Father is back `\> Delly

Because he has a history of this sort of shit. If he'd only ever done it once or twice, no one would've assumed any ill intent behind it.`\dont worry, there is a great chance 4/5 of the roster will be gone in the summer anyway`\Someone call the waaaaaaambulance `\No Blake`\IDK what their post-trades record was but I remember hearing that, when extrapolated, it was definitely a mid-60s club.`\catch and pipe`\No one kills wing players like Bill Self.`\crazy he can easily get 20 playing with a guy like kobe`\Any news on Russell?`\you remember incorrectly`\bucks are gonna be so good with another year or two of experience. their core group is young and dangerous`\cavs just lost to a 20 win team,ayy lmao

`\lol no foul there`\Lol nah, kobes been to 7 NBA finals winning 5. Comments like that should be reserved for ringless or unsuccessful players `\I know`\Yeah... can we not talk about how much we've avoided injury please?`\I'd rather have someone who isn't blind of the team's problem than someone who constantly sucks on the team's collective jocks.`\Grit n Goons `\Every single Clipper in uniform scored. That's awesome!`\I would've been offended if he didn't do the balls gesture`\Fuck your tacos`\i think doc was trying to call a timeout and they ignored him`\Who?`\I figured his defense was actually pretty good when, after he got traded to the cavs, he said in an interview that he felt his defense was underrated.  He's a very well-spoken guy so I gave him the benefit of the doubt and he's proving himself defensively. `\Thx fam`\wheres the goaltend you bitch`\Thick? Man, she might not be one of those hollywood sticks, but she is not thick. She's got nice curves on an average body.`\Hahahaha, YEAH CLARKGOAT! MAKE UP FOR IT.`\Prepare for the inevitable Matt Barnes, Lance and Hollins revenge game in the opening round. `\i cant wait for cp3 to come to san antonio

Honestly. Our young guys looked great (Randle/Clarkson/Russell AND Nance, IMO), Huertas continued to be a solid back up. Also a MWP sighting!`\Cream shake`\Thunder are a lot less scary to us than the Clippers.

Westbrook isn't shutting down Dame, we can hide CJ on Dion because he's bad, and our best defender is a SF.

Plus, they have no interior scoring presence to destroy us with, unless you want to play Kanter. Which we're perfectly fine with.

Obviously we're the underdog no matter what, but OKC doesn't match up well`\... why frye wtf`\We aren't going to get swept lmao. I don't even think the Nets got swept in the playoffs and we are better than that Nets team and the Heat were better than this Cavs team.`\No need to even watch 2nd half.

Fuck man, I still have tomorrow. `\How the Heat turned it around post all star break is beautiful`\Upvote if you're drinking beer.

`\The Cavs demeanor through three and a half quarters was so nonchalant. It was like they were offended that Memphis was trying to play defense.

Absolutely not. I consider the refs to be the margin of error for a game and I very seldom get upset over calls unless it gets completely ridiculous.

Some of us are Cleveland fans all around so we're extremely pessimistic in general, not really cocky. But it's whatever, just wish the game threads didn't evolve into senseless circlejerking threads. Oh well. Gg. `\CP3 MY MAN. He just schooled that dude.

We even play Phoenix twice and we better lose twice.`\Talking about a fucking circle jerk, the lakers won't sniff the playoffs before Kobe is a hall of famer. Kobe will probably need to coach the next laker playoff team.

Is this the first time this year that they won back to back games? Yes, you deserve a circle jerk.`\Frye is beginning to look like a genius pick up. `\"tonight"`\Boston has a great team of role players.`\He always sucks against legit teams. Warriors (his first game with the Clips), Thunder, and now the Cavs.

He has decent to good games against lesser teams. `\I like the squad we have out right now Huertas-Swag-Metta-Nance-Bass
they all seem to play hard on defense and have great ball movement offensively `\They have Vlade, but i doubt anyone is able to cope with Boggie's ego`\Lol the lakers trying to be sure and be bad but not bad enough to get s top 5 pick`\Kyrie is getting smoked by Barton`\Cavs got some nerve playing Harry Potter music while introducing the Wizards' starting lineup.

`\You mean the team that blew our ass out twice.`\Nice job Metta. `\They let lebron be physical but not the defender

Unless they play the Warriors `\Guess we will finally see Nick again`\Nt scammer.

Carlisle was gonna be the mastermind that unlocked his potential with Deron fucking Williams at the helm.  Oh, and they said Dirk's shooting coach was going to make him into some kind of amazing shooter.  I kid you not.  I doubt he'll ever flourish with a PG that isn't CP3, he is the best at running system.  `\I believe his minutes have been changed.

Now, he plays the whole first quarter, the second half of the 2nd quarter, the last 6-7 minutes of the third and the last 8 minutes of the 4th quarter.`\It got too close `\Barry is a known Kobe hater`\Ah man, it's finally hitting me that my childhood will soon end...`\Ball movement so consistent now :)`\This teams makes me rock hard. Back to back threes!`\Damn melo is salty.`\Always and forever`\GINO`\No Russell will probably score more than 10 points.`\Yeah, I agree. The fall looked nasty.`\Huertas > Irving & Dellavedova`\well here we go`\Marcelo and Julio head to head on who gets the most assists`\The 4th quarter of that game was when I started doubting though. I mean, we blew a 20 pt lead, gave up 40+ points and still won because Lowry, but that ending with giving Anderson a 4 pt play late in the game up 5 and then JV nearly committing the biggest fail of all time (goaltending a 50 foot heave that never happened because of an over and back). That entire trainwreck of closing out a game due to inexperience... I was sure we'd win the series after the 3rd, but after the 4th, I really didn't feel too good about our chances even up 3-2.`\No, it's not. I promise it's not. I said I SWEAR IT'S NOT A PANIC FOOD. STOP YELLING AT ME!!!`\I can't wait to see Anderson get playing time next season`\Getting scored on by Delladadova has to be the most embarrassing moment for any NBA player`\Tony Allen? WTF`\It's not the worst thing in the world that ya'll overpaid for a great role player.

But you don't need to keep pretending like you swept him up amidst a wave of offers.  He would've tuckered himself out and came crawling back, Kam Chancellor style, and you would've had a better deal.

The Pistons overpaid on our FA signings.  They were great signings, but we could've gotten away with less.`\edit.`\Whatever leads to that CASH MONEY!`\Mirza game winner incoming`\Huertas is a Laker legend `\At least we have 9 tonight =P`\TONY ALLEN THE SHARPSHOOTER`\this game is amazing right now`\goddamn shump`\Could somebody post the Julius Randle face?`\Haven't seen a zbound in a while `\Bron feeling unselfish today`\Lue looks like the fish from spongebob `\I am OK with this`\You guys I thought Lebron was a complete scrub from behind the 3 point line? `\Did you just create an account for this shitpost?`\Jokic's assists`\CJ McCollum is a lock for MIP IMO.`\Propel strawberry kiwi`\11-7-7 for Clarkson.

Just casually walking down the floor while his team has possession.`\Are you alright there, mate`\How many games like this you think we would have seen if byron played him like he deserved?`\"EVEN" JR? Bruh he's like the 8th best 3 point shooter in the league right now.... smh`\Boring so far`\There was so much contact right there, what the fuck`\What's weird is we have plenty, just not in the 3rd/4th. If we could keep the pace the whole game we would be so dominant.`\Remember when you all cheered for him after the guy you now worship again betrayed you? `\These Cavs announcers are unbearable.`\Upset Week.  Magic romp the Warriors you can quote me on that!`\Hey remember when the suns and lakers meant something? Circa 2006?

...I'm sad now.`\Fuck Dan Gilbert`\Kobe be like, "You're taking out TA? Man, he's been your best player tonight, thanks Joerger!" XD`\6 TOs Wiggins`\My math came out to 0.081 PPG. If you score 7 total points over the whole season then you will have accomplished your goal.`\This is how you tank the right way. Keep it a close game till the last minute and then throw it away.

Good job boys!`\Scalabrine jr`\While we do, I can't tell you how fucking crazy I went watching us win last night against the Nets. Fuck all this tanking, it can't end soon enough for me. `\JR always gets this look on his face like "we finna do something crazy right about now" and I get immediate goosebumps`\Remember when doc revolved the bench around prigs/Cole pick and rolls and it completely raised up the production of the bench? Ah those were the days.

`\Damn Winslow can't shoot at all`\Tommy H isn't calling this game..`\As if it wasn't last year lol`\Russell with his Kobe impression`\so we cant beat the Grizz but the Lakers can. `\Bye bye Brook`\You cant talk shit when your team is the Sixers`\Love has gotta keep his cool, but I can see why he was upset.

`\We got any Pacer fans in here to give us the 20/20 Hindsight on Lance?

Mwahahah yes`\Let's make fun of Austin Rivers! Oh yea, he played well.`\You could argue he was never the best player in the league (though it's not an easy one to make), but you CANNOT argue he was never the face of the league. That's bogus.`\delly "ah fuck it no one's open"`\JR perfecting the Kobe assist`\At least it's over.`\Hes shooting over 50 past 20 games.`\I get being upset with the non call on lance, but this one is pretty clear`\Great game by lebron, didn't force himself on it and let it come to him. When his shot stopped falling he immediately made the correction.

Also the pacers really choked on that one, not closing out on their best shooter with 1 min to go? come on man..

looks like they have too much respect to the cavs, i was especially surprised at monta (?) helping JR up in the 4th instead of going on a 5-4 fast break.`\Who's a better shooter JJ or Klay Thompson?`\That game was fucking amazing...`\as usual`\Sometimes I can't help but hate my team's fanbase... `\Rick continually playing this lineup is is like in LoL when you keep playing a champ you suck at in ranked games but you want to make it work `\So.......... Literally the Dubs ��`\The Chronicles of Redick Escape from Staples Center`\29th in opponent free throws for a reason. Celtics try to bully teams to stay in games and foul a lot. I'd think you guys would be used to it by now. `\I don't even think that people really feel like he's a bad player- just wildly inconsistent. You never know which Jeff Teague is going to show up and there are games at a time that feel like he's checked out and just going through the motions.

For us, it's frustrating- especially when you compare him with Schroder who is like 110% hustle 110% of the time, even if he gets a little reckless.`\fired into the Phoenix Suns?`\You'sa busta`\# A Concise Game Guide for Tonight

Nah. Kawhi vs. Steph will be A1.`\The year is 2016 and Sasha Vujacic is your starting shooting guard.

Yikes.`\This is gonna be a thriller!`\Uhm Lebron is the most overrated player I've ever seen in sports.

-This is a person who picks his teammates, can't win, and is excused for not having any help.

-He has a narrative about him that he has the highest iq in basketball when he obviously dominates because of his athleticism.

-ESPN says he has handles like Steve Nash.

-ESPN says hes the 3rd best player of all time and was the best in the league since 2006 and that its not even close when he couldn't even win in 2011.

-Christ.`\Lol we suck`\We're cutting like San Antonio`\Can you imagine trying to watch that in VR?

Was very disappointed.`\What's annoying is how we can't seem to get the whole big three going at once. LeBron is almost always one, but Kyrie and KLove take turns. When Kyrie was out, KLove fit in the offense better. When Kyrie struggled, KLove still looked good. But now that Irving has his rhythm back Love has slumped again.

We've only had like one short stretch of season where they are all firing together. If we can capture that in the playoffs we would actually stand a chance in the Finals. `\Any HD stream ?`\I don't know what to expect at this point. The normal Wizards would've lost to either the Sixers or Timberwolves after that win against the Cavs at home, but they won those too.

Let's win? `\lmao I thought he was a fan`\The NBA needs a Heat Cavs ECF`\Man, it looked like Zaza got whacked`\eh, its all within context, I don't actually expect the lakers to be good this year.

* 20 Points for Kobe

* A solid 4 points and 7 assists from Huertas, who led the game in assists

* And 18 Points and 6 rebounds from Bass, about 6 points that came in the last 3 minutes.

TBH, we shouldn't have won this game. It was a meaningless one, but it showed how good we can be with Clarkson and Randle, even though they have flaws in some areas. Hope Russell's alright.

Seems like he's more pull up jump shots and step backs, while Harden is threes and drawing fouls.`\Hell use his dick`\Whatever you say blindman nuggets guy.`\Jamal giveth taketh away`\most oxymoronic name the league has ever seen`\Wooww`\Hey Kevin, where you get all them dimes?`\JR's ice cold tonight.`\It was a voice joke`\16/10 is trash?

I wish all of our players were trash`\Lol Cavs `\23-23 wow`\1-2 years is optimistic, yes, but 2 of those teams have really only become genuine contenders within the last few years anyway. Who's to say the same thing won't happen with LA? Investing in young talent pays off.`\I mean.. you're asking for Thad to feast if you put Wes Johnson on him. Get Thad the ball!!`\He was looking at a 2013 Kevin Love highlight reel`\I was so pumped for about 3 seconds!`\THE FUTURE IS LOOKING BRIGHT`\ http://imgur.com/gallery/pdZFiYm`\Damn that dunk would've been so sick`\i hate you more than i like you this season, bojan `\There it is.`\Same here.

Color guys who just sound like normal guys watching a game are kind of appealing.`\this is horse shit`\Afflalo is garbage lmao.`\His attitude definitely hurts. I like that he gets passionate but there were soooo many plays tonight where he would make a mistake and just walk back with his head down. It seems like there isn't anyone on the team that can tell him to quit with the theatric bullshit and hustle 100%. On one hand I feel bad that such a solid player has had to deal with such an unstable organization, but on the other hand there are too many times when he needs to shut the fuck up and get back on D. `\demaciaaaa`\Clipper have never choked in the first round as a 1 seed though. I think that sets the all time bar as far as choking goes.`\If you need a guy to control the 2nd unit and make the occassional pick-and-rolls, Huertas is the guy. He might not necessarily have big shots, but he makes good plays. If only our team actually finished his plays.`\Great game by the lakers, nice ball movement all around from our best rookie Marcelo Huertas. Randle also showing nice control with his moves lately, things looking up for lakers.

I can assure you that this doesn't happen every night for fucks sake, no need to overreact. `\As a Celtics fan, I have very mixed feelings about this outcome. Screw it. Fuck the Cavs!

GoGrizz`\Looks like the rest of the Cavs went in playoff mode early as well`\Man I am loving Hump's activity on both ends of the floor from what I'm seeing. He's being physical with their bigs on the defensive end (which we DESPERATELY need), he's running the floor on the break, setting screens -everywhere- in the offensive end, and battling hard on the boards.

If this is how he plays all the time he's going to be a damn good signing for us.`\Juice`\I feel bad for the Cavs... it's not fair that we have this lopsided of a PG advantage`\I'm a Mavs fan as well as Magic fan. He's been good for a lot of his time here in Dallas, but I just don't like his inconsistency. And his defense has been terrible. `\Channing Frye would drill those 3s`\TT too fat and slow for my boy Mike`\Yeah, we are just getting outplayed by a better team. It happens.`\What Logic?

Vision isn't just about drive and kick. But OK. There are plenty of incredible passing highlights from Russell. Most of it is sadly in college because Byron's offense is stifling.

I also know in advance you won't buy the argument. But that's fine. I don't really expect you to. The highlights will come naturally as the Lakers transition into a modern offense.`\Mozzy is at 4m now, under the new cap he'll get around 8m-10m and that's a bargain, who else are you going to get with just an mle because we are WAY over the cap and will be for 5 years?

Y'all will probably walk through whoever is in the 8th seed, and y'all match up better against Boston than you do against us. Whiteside's rebounding would give y'all a lot of trouble and our offensive pace is a lot faster than it was, so recently we're getting great play out of Dragic and Wade. I think we could handle everyone but LeBron, so it'd be all on him, not saying he couldn't do it, since playoffs LeBron is a monster, but I think it'd be an easier match up against this young Celtics team. An easier first and second rounds would be what you want before you play Toronto (or us, hopefully) in the conference finals.`\HOLY SHIT Lebron :O`\I mean that's a huge thing especially if the Coaches didn't know before the time out.

Note: Data from basketball-reference, March 16th. Data from ranges 0-3,3-10,10-16,16-<3pt,3p are plotted to the midpoint of the range. For example, FG% for 0-3 is plotted at 1.5 feet, 3-10 at 6.5, 10-16 at 13, 16-<3pt at 19.875. 3pt% is plotted at 23.75 however. The curves in between ARE NOT to be used to extrapolate data accurately, it merely shows the *trend* between separate points, as the area under the curves divided by a unit length will not provide the FG% for the range as an average value.`\Why...? Curry was MVP and they won the title last year. `\What? They even showed an aerial view and he was clearly outside.`\TEAM`\I especially like how Lebron watches who's Kyrie's guarding....as Kyrie always allows penetration.  Lebron was there like 10 different times with great help defense.`\They're missing their arguably best player`\check again ;)`\It's not a joke, I'm actually asking. He always does really well against the Hawks.`\most of the time its because he gets lazy or tries to be fancy`\huertas is fucking killing

give him some MVP chants`\Lmao what the fuck.`\do you need prayer?`\NO MORE PARTIES IN LA PLEASE BABY NO MORE PARTIES IN LA`\HeGone`\not sure if you watched the last call`\Time out to turn over...lmfao...fuck it`\But it isn't by 50 and that is what matters!`\http://i.imgur.com/dyeHb.gif`\Yeah we fucking did

This is a spectacular season to convert to being a Memphis can

Fuck rollercoasters`\2011 I thought?`\Tank needs reinforcement bring in Ryan kelly`\damn that lead disappeared fast`\Woooo baby when Marcus is hitting 3s you know somethings up `\What's wrong with the VLC streams?`\Why did ESPN pick up so many Lakers games?`\So, DLo got injured? What happened?`\Huertas has the ball in his hands way more than clarkson though. Huertas main job is to pass. Huertas can't shoot or play D so the only way he can stay on the floor is by his passing skills. D'lo, Huertas, or Lou usually are the main ball handlers when JC is on the floor. `\LETS GOOOOO DANGELO`\I forgot how fun Kobe was to watch when he got on a hot streak`\jennings in high af lol`\Will the Kings ever be good again? `\I don't believe you, but I don't know enough about hamster cars to say otherwise`\Definitely all ball. Lucky call`\He is a perfect fit for what we need at PG, a secondary ball handler who can shoot really well while Giannis runs plays.`\fuck this I am picking up Huertas in my fantasy`\Yeah, to caught that pass on the baseline and could have probably gotten up a good shot in the paint, instead he doesn't even look and just throws it back out. `\Aren't Lakers supposed to be tanking right now? `\Scott Skiles doesn't want to give out tacos`\I feel he is either really on or really off. Definitely has potential though`\He's a help defender, and does it far better than Moz this season. It's a real shame as last year he was a big factor.`\Wow, great stuff Cavs. I was unsure of this game after the Wiz game w/o Bron but we are looking great!`\They wore them last time they played @ CLE, so I think its a bit of superstition. I don't mind if that's the case.`\both teams are middle of the pack non contenders who did well in the regular season against the only team with a chance of winning the east.`\I don't really have an issue with you.  Swamp's a Houston troll who I consistently snipe at.`\That was beautiful`\Celtics v. Old Celtics?`\Has incredible potential, his biggest flaw is that he's basically "basketball illiterate". He was really good when he played with Wall though.`\He doesn't want to show his final form until the last boss fight.`\why take kobe out...`\Chauncey Billups description of the Celtics was accurate IMO.`\It was a foul on Kyrie`\Born Ready!`\Hard to be any more disappointed than I am right now but I will be if Lance goes the whole game without randomly sucker punching someone.`\Hickson is performing hack'a Shaq on himself.`\Damn, shump!`\damn irving is best friends with the floor tonight
`\> allen is also going HAM on offense

I'll take "Things I never expected to hear" for $400, Alex`\If he took like 5-6 less shots and just chased triple doubles, he could have a few hundred for sure.`\hey man, he didn't even say it had to be someone on the Celtics`\The Memphis Rag Tags`\I'm not going to be able to watch one of our few nationally televised games but I'll be rooting hard. Hoping for big games from the Guards and Milk Dudz to go for 20. `\ahh, that's fair`\I tried once during the Olympics but yeah it's like watching ice melt but a bit faster. `\KOBEEEEEE WITH THE DREAM SHAKE`\king my ass`\Wade dunked on over 170m worth of Cavs players.`\In favor of who?`\Them Refs`\I gotchu bro I will let Smart know for sure. `\In the unlikely chain of events where our first round opponent is decimated by PED suspensions it would be best to be in the 8 spot. But I want 6 dammit Blazers go cold.`\PJ really did bring out the best in our bench back in those days.`\:(`\SEND DELLY TO THE D LEAGUE`\that was just mean`\This thread didn't disappoint with the overreactions. When he's dropping 20/12 in the Finals, get back to this topic. `\If brook makes a finals appearance with the nets that would change alot `\Come on Lakers.`\Marcelo will be a pretty good role player. For another team.`\Tony 'MJ' Allen`\LeBron yelling at and blaming teammates already...`\Porque no los dos?`\Lol you guys are crazy. Pineapple is good as fuck`\They really are awesome.

They aren't afraid to call it like it is, too, even openly admitting when one of our guys flops or whatever. Love 'em.`\Wall needs more help. Bring back the Wiz kids`\Get rivers the fuck out. Jesus`\Can the refs just fuck me in the ass without all of this bullshit`\Does anyone have a gif of Lebron's robot?`\Key to success is injuring your star big man`\Welp, that was awful.

Can't bear to watch Garrett Temple play basketball anymore, I just can't`\*bangs head*`\No lol`\CARRY US BEAL`\WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOW `\Lebron would do better in Brooklyn at this point`\I hope we end up with either Ingram or Hield with the BKN pick. We need someone other than Isaiah who can reliably put the ball in the hoop`\All our fans were mad at Wade for missing the buzzer beater 3 to tie last night, and now he's gone off on the Cavs to show them this is still his house`\WTF Isaiah, this is not the time to miss free throws.`\Troll? 10 year old? Both?`\I don't care about the tank. We've got Booker.`\Damn Kobe just abused Lebron in the paint, made him look like a rookie `\Good point, but never the less after the initial "hype" I suppose that was around him and his rough start faded, he really kicked it into a higher gear and has been playing much better. It's been like this lately, people are just starting to see it though`\Russell *really* wanted to heat check there hahaha`\ugh Del Taco is freaking disgusting `\Stalking his prey `\Alright, I know we play hard all 48 minutes but 12 points with 3 minutes left against a top team isn't "nothing" `\i hate this game.`\All my Laker comrades, are we hyped for the future or what?!!`\is jamal going to be a come from behind 6th man of the year candidate again? the dude is ballin out of control`\DAMN YOU GREEN!`\Yeah, basically no rich people in Dallas outside of SMU students`\The Celtics`\Was it really that improbable for Knicks to beat Bulls? We were 2-1 against them coming into last night's game.`\Nuggets as well`\If you think this is an insult you have soft skin. This is just an observation.`\Warriors v Spurs thread, I think`\Clippers are making bs shots rn `\http://i.imgur.com/1F4QL1x.gif`\Was there a close-up replay? Can't really tell for myself`\OH GOD I HATE THE PACIFIC TIME ZONE.  So sleepy.`\Just an intense good game by both sides.


Hopefully DLO's knee bruise isn't worse than it appears and I dear hope to god Zbo's ankle is alright; the NBA gods just hate the Grizzlies this season.`\phoenix needs to stop winning`\So it's not just my team that stares dumbfounded at a player wide open for a 3`\People coming here to work out what the fuck was going on.`\Honestly surprised J.R. hasn't decked anyone yet. `\BEEF SQUASHED LEAGUE FUCKED`\That celebration by Russell, Randle, and Clarkson at the end brought tears to my eyes ;)`\They've been going heavy with dope Hip-Hop.

It was an alright game. There were certainly some calls I felt were one sided, but I also felt the Celtics were not playing up to their full potential. You can't do that and expect to beat the Cavs.`\Starting lineup loaded with shooters, but no strong secondary ballhandler.

It's gon be the Russell show tonight`\https://twitter.com/mcten/status/708112264105054208

That's amazing. Thanks for doing all of this!`\any reason to think mozgov wouldn't have had that if lebron didnt go up? they didnt see each other and its as simple as that, no reason for lebron to get mad at him`\Lebron just got punched in the mouth with no call, how can you complain that it's one sided. Clearly the refs suck on both sides.`\No excuses tonight just look at that lineup`\OH MY GOD Northern Iowa with the half court buzzer beater HOLY SHIT`\Thank you nuggets, either russell leads an epic comeback or the tank stays intact.

Made a flair bet about not thinking they'd hit 20-0.

Also, fuck the Yankees and Man U. Been a Tigers fan my whole life, and closest thing to a EPL team I've ever had is Man City. And don't even get me started on Alabama. I'm a Michigan fan, the only thing worse than Saban is any OSU coach. `\I think there's a raps vs heat game next week. Gonna be a big game for both `\Really entertaining game. Memphis had a very good gameplan tonight. Played Cleveland very physical and crashed the glass on every shot. Tony Allen was insane tonight on both ends. Pretty unlucky for us that tonight is the night that Allen wants to hit all of his jumpshots.

Lance Stephenson's little battle with LeBron really hurt Memphis. He was clearly more invested in trying to show out against LeBron than play for the good of the team. Stepped up when it counted though. Luckily they got the win anyways. I thought it was an over the back against Delly on the jump ball, but we had plenty of calls go our way today too, so can't really complain I guess.

Love is in a bit of a cold streak right now, hopefully he turns it around soon. Cavs clearly didn't take the Grizzlies seriously and it was too little too late in the end. Good game Memphis. `\Huertas is the little engine that could.`\And yet the Grizzlies are probably scoring more than their first choice team would. `\i keep getting a 404?`\literally changing the game`\CP3, Blake, LMA, and Towns.

Wanted to be sure I wasn't crazy and checked, Lowry is 10th in PER and Towns is 13th...`\Goaltend `\Well Lou is out the game, left hamstrin.`\I calls 'em likes I sees 'em. `\I'm really happy he's managed to find his place in this team; hopefully we can resign him but I wouldn't be surprised if he went to a serious contender next season.`\Gross`\Whalen is kinda bad.`\Giannis > Lebron .... Prove me wrong cavs fans`\Damm Lue is so ugly man. Looks like a codfish.`\That's not how this works. That's not how any of this works!`\Lol`\> might be

lol wat. 0 points in 26 mins. Nothing "might be" about that. `\I'm not sure why they aren't getting the ball to Huertas every single time.. but fuck this iso bullshit. I've seen enough iso basketball to last a lifetime.`\she is thick as fuck bro google her

edit: shit that doesn't do well for Lakers, 6th I mean lol`\Team Ast/TO just over 3 that might be our best this year.`\They heard Cali was in a drought....just trying to help them out.`\It's almost like you're watching a Cavalier broadcast`\at first I didn't believe it, but I guess since we have Young, Rozier, Hunter, Mickey, Smart, Sully and no one over 30, it makes sense`\Len will probably have a good game with this shit tier defense.`\Cleveland apparently has a lot of money to blow. Probably using the tax money`\Yeaaaaah we won a game! TWO GAMES IN A ROW ACTUALLY.

AND WE OUTREBOUNDED SOMEONE.

Dude was trash as well. At least Kyrie puts up decent numbers most nights. Love's shot has disappeared and he's not even trying on defense.`\Huertas why`\KOBE`\[Lou Will's 3 to take the lead.](https://streamable.com/8ldp)`\Huertas looks like a smaller version of Jim James. `\You're just trolling at this point. See yah man.`\No foul on that rebound?

Edit:  if ever there was a post that I thought wouldn't require the /s tag at the end...`\cavs looked like they didnt give a fuck in the last five minutes, their defense was awful and they were walking the ball up the court with no urgency at all. `\Top 5 is an understatement.

It'll be really interesting to see which team is the first to completely abandon LeBron on the 3 point line when it's an Irving/Thompson PnR to play help defense.`\He can't. He's less than 0.6 points per possession in isos last I checked.`\ITS DUNKIN DOUGHNUTS TIME`\WE WANT TACOSSS`\FUCK DAN CRAWFORD! We've have like a 3-16 record when he refs our games`\I don't disagree. Isn't the rule if no one has position,  they both have the right to the space? Delly needs to learn how to box out. `\lol Knicks pls come on we dont really need this win.`\Lebron and Kobe having a dick-waving contest...this is gonna get good (I hope).`\I think we're pretty good off even without the pick, but why wouldn't we want another high value prospect after a lost season like this one?`\This game is fucking amazing!`\No more parties in L.A.`\did not know that

so the Cavs also wouldn't do that (likely)`\cant let bron run a train unmolested on our paint`\The sub does it for you. You just need to start the game thread.`\I wouldn't hold it against him if he leaves, it's a job. I'm also not from Cleveland so I'm just a LeBron fan. He could go straight mercenary mode and sign 1-year deals and win rings in 5 cities and I wouldn't judge him for a second, it might actually be more impressive. I mean, everyone would shit on his legacy if he did that but he'd have more rings. `\People change bro he shouldn't be defined by what he did as a teenager`\Everyone's on March Madness duty`\Can we take Lou Will back for the playoffs?`\He probably likes it`\Our young core showed up in OT and brb I am investing on Hibbertcoin `\it's standard for fadeaway shots yet they've called it on swaggy p twice in the last week. it's completely normal motion and the only reason the leg kicked out as much as it did is because the player ran into it`\Dirk has too much pride. There was a cool moment tonight where he tipped the ball in on a rebound at the end of the first half to put us up by two.  Dirk has no quit in him.`\the second play was much less of a play than the first imo. Second one was just good defending.`\They're not going to hit 18 3s but they can play with this energy.`\Who the fuck is Jarell Martin and why is he playing like Wilt against us. `\Lebron is a regular season god`\STRAIGHT GOONIN ON THEM HOES

seriously GG Cavs, one step closer to LAC. `\D'lo emulating Kobe tonight.`\damn i didn't think it was that many lol anyway good win`\Player development is a major part of coaching. Everyone was very willing to blame Scott earlier in the season for stunting their growth. If a coach can hurt someone's development, then they can also develop talent. Just like Scott Brooks always gets credit for helping develop KD and Westbrook. `\The rotations are there tonight :]`\2:38 right now. Game starts at 3:30.

You can't just make up shit.`\Can someone post the sequence where they took the Pacers 3 points away? I understand it was clearly a shot clock violation, but before that, we almost got an 8 second violation. How did we go from a Ian rebound, pass to PG, then all of a sudden there is 18 on the shot clock?`\The Celtics losing and Pierce getting injured is pretty much my worst case scenario for any NBA regular season game for me..so this isn't going well`\I misread the title and thought the Lakers dismantled the Jazz. I was chanting "Go Kobe!" In my head. I'm so disappointed right now. `\"Harass that!"-JC`\Actually I'm pretty sure he's a 12 footer. `\How is JR making all these uncontested threes. `\They did Conrad dirty on the time-out show..`\Looked like he at least had a good form on that one. `\Why do people who post this think they're contributing anything?`\Hence, why I said his first 10-15 games.

Eh..`\'Kobe' - Kobe`\Good games from Mudiay and Russell. Why can't we just leave it at that? This incessant need to prove to everyone one that their player is better than the other is stupid.

Both teams are happy with their rookie point guards.

Despite the obvious performances, Jokic had another great game. 14/6/3 2 blocks in 28 minutes. Joffrey showing he has post moves, still lacking defensively however.

Garry Harris is mr consistent and I feel he doesn't get enough recognition because of that, he doesn't have huge games and he scores ~15 regularly and plays good D every game.`\Tell em <3

I'm loving the future. I've been telling all my friends that the Lakers will definitely get a ring before the Celtics but they sleepin`\Clippers should have traded for Channing, he's killing it these last 2 games in LA`\Being part of the ride has been awesome!`\Thanks for the input! I'm still fooling around with the formatting; I'll definitely consider converting it into tables`\Yeah, it's pretty weird. Especially since it's LA.`\Jordan Clarkson wanted no part of that Aaron Gordon dunk`\Damn, the Allen jumper is crazy funky`\Idk who it was but when Lebron tried to stop in front of PJ a Grizz ran into his back. `\Is this going to be the first time Lebron gets bounced out of the playoffs early in 6 years?`\Do people usually do that to you instead of answer your question?`\Sup man

Yo that bitch i told you about in tinder is straight up crazy

Still gonna hit tho...fuck it`\Well, disappointing game from the rookies, except Russell. Just hope for more improvements in the next few games and going forward.`\Wow that bounce lol`\The Russian Dream`\Did the announcer just say the cavs were hosting the jazz In Utah?`\Yeah, Texas is just wonderful. `\Randle reminds me so much of Barkley`\Ya whiteside only with 20/17/7 scrub`\74 points on 29/52 shooting for our soon to be big 3 of Russell, Clarkson, and Randle. I'm excited for the future.`\Cleveland, under Lue at least, is a very good big game team. It seems we gameplan really well for top opponents. Beat the Spurs, beat the Thunder, beat the Celtics, our only loss to another top team was that close one to the Raptors, but I'll cut the Cavs some slack for that one. Hard to beat the Raptors when Lowry is dropping 43`\That's all ball`\Miami with the long dick tonight.

God damn`\hahaha KOBEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE`\He got fouled`\if y'all are toggling games, tune into the Big 10 championship. It is getting insane over there. `\MVpeez nuuuuuuuts.`\I haven't seen this many 3s since I sat in the studio audience of Dr. Oz`\Well being down 13 is a blessing with the way both teams are shooting lol`\This is dumb. He doesn't cut his own crust. He is not allowed to hold sharp objects. Daddy Doc cuts it for him.`\And those Detroit boys.`\CP3 got the best handles in the league imo`\Oh god please. `\Take it easy, bud. Just relax`\Bron with the casual 3dub.`\I smell comeback.`\Fuck foul trouble`\It's probably high stress trying to live up to lebrons standards. `\Fallout Boy makes good videogame trailer music`\Isn't it already practically in the bag? You're 4.5 games ahead of the Suns.`\Not with how hot Kyrie is; he's hitting every shot.`\Depends. If we can get Hassan as a FA (fingers crossed), the Lakers look dramatically better. Add in the possibility of someone like Batum and you've got a stew goin, baby. `\lol tht ending`\Officiating is comical at this point, aren't even hiding it`\On pace for a 72-44 game. I can hardly contain my excitement tbh.`\33-33`\ZBo just doin' work`\Delly gettin schoold`\Where's the normal TNT crew? Fuck Thursday ruined. `\Dude, what the fuck is this Grizzlies team? No team has entertained and confused me more.`\LOL Mavs`\Kobe's like "You're sending help Lebron?  Pffffffff..."`\REFBALL `\he's gonna bring us Ingram with his chucking`\He is honestly one of the best players ever at running off of off the ball screens. It's a seriously over looked skill. `\Was wondering myself too, pretty sure I counted 3 steps.`\lmao is a 35% shooter always hot every night?`\How has Jeff Green been Clips?`\I mean Lou Will is averaging 18.9 per 36 this year versus 22.2 last year, that's not a huge fall-off... and honestly both are good numbers.  I think the only real problem is that you have an excellent bench shooter starting.`\whoa the suns won a game`\Props to Kobe for shutting down a flaming hot Hood in the 3rd, it let the rest of the team heat up. :)`\I'll allow it.  You have to be careful sometimes, a lot of people pretend to be Canadian on the internet for the cool factor.`\Meh...couple less rebounds for a true Lebron`\Especially if Giannis is going to play point guard in the future. Monroe is good but he doesn't exactly fit with them nor is he in their core's age range. `\don't put that evil on us percy`\It's this sub's favorite thing to do`\I appreciate your dedication`\Did you not watch the game? Avery Bradley got called for a charge against Kevin Love, which was the right call, 2 minutes later Kyrie Irving drove and Jae Crowder had just as much position as Love did, got called for a blocking foul.  `\That is legit my favorite video ever. It's probably the only time I've ever enjoyed Stephen A say anything before. `\You calling for help!?`\http://i.imgur.com/6ADLV4r.gif`\Yea cause look at all the great defenders at point guard with all those titles. The greatest point guard ever wasn't exactly known for his stellar defense.`\I'm gonna come so hard all of LA will feel it`\Nance with Melo on him, bout to put the Knicks on bonus`\Damn this thread came up late`\Your reddit account shares a birthday with Byron Scott.   I'm sorry. `\For sure.  If we get Simmons or Ingram I definitely see 30+ wins next year, but I know we gonna get obnoxious with the 8th seed talk once again lol.`\I saw you each time cuz I had to type multiple times as well`\There's a lot more to scoring than just post game`\What % of the crowd is Laker fans?`\that was an infuriating thread

https://ns.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/3upmsc/tied_game_lebron_hacks_lopez_in_front_of_two_refs/ `\...same defense `\He b-lined it as soon as he saw him still on the floor. `\Are there actually still Kia-LeBron doubters out there?`\Can't wait to go eat my delicious Jack in the Box Tacos! `\Wtf you're a Warriors and patriots fan? Don't tell me you also follow the Yankees, Manchester United, and Alabama
`\I was getting worried D:
`\Mind blown.`\Omg me too?!`\Simba needs more minutes than JJ`\Always does baby `\career high for D'Lo!!!!`\Maybe I'm giving him too much credit, but sometimes I wonder in these types of games if this wasn't on purpose.  In a game where he's carrying the team on his back, he thinks back to last year's finals and thinks, "I can't win by doing that again."  So he tries to defer to his teammates a little more.  One loss now doesn't truly mean anything, but if he finds a new wrinkle to use in a big playoff series, it might be worth it.  Just a thought.`\thompson pls`\Was even worse when he had the cornrows`\Cavs looked great right from the start tonight. When they are firing you really can see how elite they are.`\Because Gasol, Butler, and Rose never have absolute dogshit games.`\The ones that live in memphis or cleveland?`\Lebron put your dad dick away Jesus


EDIT: Kobe answered back GG`\I can tell that most people here don't watch Cavs games. Kevin Love gets many post-ups and he just doesn't score. Even his post skills got way worse.`\are you kidding? he scored 10 from the post`\Fuck the ~~Clippers~~ Lakers!`\Alright calm down. Let's not get toxic here!`\Just checked the score....Whats going on?`\Yes, I'm soooo angry.`\Here comes a bail out for lebron `\Byron is feeling this game out.`\Im gunnin for that 6 seed! Choo choo!!`\Pure torture.`\Lol and if you won by FTs you wouldn't be happy? Gtfo`\[NBA even admitted the lack of calls.](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/dc-sports-bog/wp/2016/03/26/nba-report-says-refs-missed-14-calls-at-end-of-wizards-2ot-loss-to-minnesota/) 14 missed calls, 9 against the Wiz, 2 against Wall, all in the final 2 min. + 2OT.`\flagrant 2 pls`\Is anyone watching on NBA TV? What is going on with the scoring operator? Keeps awarding the wrong team points.`\top umlaut banter`\oh I didn't know that, I just remembered the Heat cut him. There has to be some PG options out there though`\YAY PLAYER INTROS!!!  But how go you become an announcer if you have such an unorthodox sort of lisp. (Sorry LA folk if that is a uber-legend I just somewhat insulted.  Let me know!  I'll read his wikipedia article!).

It's a shame that this is the game we get on TNT.  Hopefully it goes like the last couple of times.

`\LeBron diming for everyone out here`\Did lebron just say "I'm gonna miss the fuck out of you" to Kobe? `\BTW: Weren't you the guy saying when Payton Manning got hurt early in hte season that he would never play in the NFL again. And I said that he would be back in time for the playoffs`\I won't try to convince you since it seems your mind is made up. I just haven't seen anything about Mudiay that conjures Wall. They don't seem to have much in common to me. Play style is different. By your own admission wall is much faster and has less strength. Who cares?`\Richardson fuck off mate`\"lets go nets" ...ya lets get 20 wins this season!`\I've missed you so much bby`\We've played garbage teams honestly. Those two losses came against the thirteen in a row losing Suns and then the same Suns four games later. `\yeah that was awkward as hell`\From what I saw he was way off to the right and it looked like a lazy contest (on purpose).  Delly wanted to minimize the chances of the shot going in while still playing it safe.  The alternate angle after the shot made it look a lot less stupid that the in-game view looked.`\It's crazy how LBJ can just sign a pair of his own shoes and sell them shits under the name Keyboard Jackson and make a few thousand off them shits`\What's that on dlo's wrist?`\JaMychal has the sharpest knees in the game `\"If only we had LeBron...."`\The starters sucked ass, don't blame the bench `\My favorite is either the UC Santa Cruz Banana Slugs or the Scottsdale Community College Fighting Artichokes.`\Channing motherfucking Frye. How quick is he for a big man?`\Dat Whiteside pass :O`\OT OT OT`\Put Nance or Tarik in for Hibbert, atleast they can hustle around the court. `\Tony Allen is unstoppable.`\I mean alright yeah sure whatever`\Fucking DJ Khaled `\Give me cp3 over any pg not named Curry. This dude has been on another level since Blakes injury`\What's up with Memphis's lineup? Where is everyone?`\Any truth to the Love being traded rumors? `\Extremely boring game `\KP trying too hard right now. `\to be honest it's not like he really had to pay attention to the second half`\Prob his first 3 in three weeks `\Lmao I'm over here thinking the same thing this dude done lost his mind.`\It always seems like we play better with only 2 of our big 3 playing... one of those two 99% of the time being Lebron of course. `\It was actually Kobe giving the 50% LA crowd something to remember from the worst game we've ever seen. `\Barry constantly reminds me of why I hate him`\FIRST TEAM`\Offensive he has been great. So why not use that to your benefit and pair him with Salah or Dwight? I don't get the Lee/Parsons and Lee/Dirk 4/5 combos, it hurts so much rebounding wise.`\if there is one thing that we can agree on after seeing this type of play tonight, it's that this absolutely means nothing when Warriors exist.  What a shitty time for Cleveland to get Lebron back.`\great game for us, big confidence boost.`\Time to put Hibbert out to pasture.`\He's a decent player, just not for this team trying to progress thier young players. He's best suited as a bench spark for a playoff team in need of bench scoring imo`\I haven't had tang since I was a youngster.`\To be fair, I can see exactly where you were coming from. Losing like that is just....ridiculous. `\Russell : " I dedicate this win to all the snitches out there, keep doing you, see I'm not dead yet and we won tonight !! Woohoo!"`\savage`\DAMMIT LEBRON. `\oh man, i hope Walls okay`\[Hey Suns fans get ready, we are coming >:D](http://i.giphy.com/yoJC2NzvLnFafw6hMI.gif)`\WTF `\I know!  How did the Grizz still win?`\Also, when the ball goes in the basket, points are scored.`\Damn can't believe you missed out. `\Fucking beautiful pass from dlo`\deangelo ayyyyy`\What a shitty, forced Game of Thrones reference...`\Huertas`\Revenge Game 2016 GONE SEXUAL`\Jeff green has been an amazing pick up`\Refs missed multiple fouls on both ends these last couple possessions. Outcome seemed fair to me. `\Kyrie 'I am a SG' Irving balled out. `\White man can't jump? Lol come on Dragic`\Amazing shot maker from what I've seen. Dude can flat out score`\clarkson wearing the headband with that haircut is trippin me out. he looks like a taller isaiah thomas`\OH SHIT`\He's a retard. `\It's funny that I got shit for saying the exact same thing about Russell going off against the horrible nets last night. `\we lost already,  can we have lebron vs kobe one v one pls`\Idk...seems like a weak flagrant to me but whatever`\I would never want DeAndre/Dwight/Drummond on my team for the sheer fact that it would be awful to have to watch teams do this 82 times/year.

I also think free throw shooting is pretty important...`\Have my babies dlo`\DLO WOOOOOOOOOOOO !!!!!!!`\HOLY FUCKLEBRON`\Finally Shump hits a 3`\Southie is a bunch of yuppies now. Not missing much`\Definitely a foul. Idk about flagrant though`\I GOT BROADS IN ATLANTA `\THAT MELO SAVE`\Checking in from the Pepsi Center. Let's go Lakers!`\Holy fuck

Julious handles `\What's happening? Why is this game so awesome?`\wow clarkson... stop shooting mate. `\Jesus Randle pass it to D'Angelo`\this is true`\He's 23rd in VORP and 29th in Win Shares on a team that has a 20-43 record.

the Kings have 5 more wins and Boogie has 33% fewer WS, GSW have 35 more Wins and Klay is down right around Boogie.

Call me optimistic if like.

`\Horrible game`\AND ONE`\Death, taxes, and Cleveland never winning anything. `\Except he didn't flop.  He got his body hooked by a pro athlete who probably benches more weight in a month than you have in your entire life.`\league = fucked`\Nah he has stomach problems`\how long you been waiting to say that?`\It's amazing he lived thru the 2010-2014 seasons`\The Nets beat the Heat in 2014 4-0 and we still destroyed them in the playoffs. `\Noooo we want Nance jams`\With Lou out, wonder who's going to fill in drawing all these bogus fouls, and hitting all these ill-advised shots`\After many years of being a Cavs fan, I finally ponied up the money and went to a game. I though that we could beat a depleted Grizzlies team at home. I thought wrong. My first game was this shit-show.`\Deandre 'The Dream' Jordan`\Fair enough. Just curious how that particular fandom came into being.`\Kobe, please stop fucking shooting.

Sincerely,

All Laker fans

P.S. Pass it to D'Angelo`\That was awesome`\Tony Allen put his hand on the ball while LeBron held the ball mid-air, and LeBron landed without shooting or passing.  That's a jump ball.  `\holy shit Lebron come in clutch, I wanna see Skip Bayless cry.`\Carter with a great game all around. That tap out of Irvings drive and these last few free throws cemented it. `\With 7 players out. Jesus `\BAAAZZZZ22222AND111111`\Shitty fans right there`\2 MORE PTS BREAK IT`\The Cavs mascot haunts my dreams. `\>Cleveland rocks `\Sorry, you can't have it.`\I wanted to downvote you but you're right.

If anything the Cavs fanbase needed to see this game for their confidence. The team probably is just dying to get to the playoffs already.`\Only when the cavs are good though`\well yes. that, too lol.

`\A man can dream!`\Lebron with a Lebron`\Do you think Kobe ever reads about himself or watches himself on youtube while waiting for his food?`\Can I just say that rarely in this sub do you see people losing with grace and complimenting their opponent. Thanks for being the good this sub needs. `\I know he did alright in the box score tonight but I cant wait till Bayless is outta here.

Also Jabari is shooting 43 percent from 3 during the all star break.`\5 v 8 ain't fun to play.`\His offensive output the last month or so just isn't worth the deficiencies he has on defense. If/when he gets his shot back he will be fine. Until then I'd like to see Frye get some run`\you've never seen a holding called in the late game?

lmao`\Perhaps you sold that to the Devil so you could beat the Warriors. Or at least that's what I want to think because I'm still crying`\I don't think I've seen anyone on this team dive for a loose ball this season.`\It is easily his best though.
  `\Why do you care what other people watch?`\no one cares bless`\Messy 2nd Qtr so far...`\Oh dude a lot of those are bandwagon fans I'm sure, every team has those.  I apologize on behalf of them. `\Maybe the worst i've ever seen Kyrie play`\Randle reminds me a whole lot of a pug with his squinched face and bugged out eyes. adorable`\That'll just make waking up harder`\Lol people always sleepin on Clarkson`\Crazy puppets, crazy.`\Haha VC god damn`\Not saying it as a positive or a negative, but he's already at 34 minutes played at the end of 3.  Curious how much he'll play him in the 4th...  `\playoff lebron is coming`\If DJ posterizes Dirk and we lose this game I'm good`\Suns > Lakers > Warriors`\It's cool I have been to staples a few times as well if I'm down visiting friends in LA. `\I will not!`\beal and richard jefferson have kept this from getting out of hand`\No`\Watching him on a basketball court gives me a headache. Everything he does is wrong.`\No Mike and Chris too.`\The Memphis Grizzlies roster collectively has nearly as much experience in the D League as in the NBA. Their point differential is not only negative, it is currently 19th (!) on the season.

And yet, they are 40-30, just five games (!!!) behind the Clippers in the L column. I mean, [this guy](http://img.bleacherreport.net/img/images/photos/002/008/810/uspw_6742306_crop_north.jpg?w=630&h=420&q=75) just got a damn triple double! Every expectation anyone could have about this team has been spun around three times and shot into a different dimension. This is secretly the craziest thing happening in a year we might see two 70 win teams. All hail the Grindfather.`\Oh like our lord and savior outback Jesus.`\These national broadcasters don't know the grizz for shit `\As much as Huertas is having a good game I wanna fucking see Russell not goddamn Marcelo Huertas. 2 mins left and he hasn't even gone back in yet ffs`\I think Gortat just got really confused because JR just fell over`\All time I'll say no`\That was a bogus call.`\Byron the tank commander. Decides to try out the same offensive sets we pulled off in summer league a game ago and now we look like an actual basketball team that isn't filled with iso-based offense.`\God damn that was clutch Lance`\:(`\Aaron Craft is one of my least favorite college players of all time. :|`\Randle's a black hole.

We'll see.`\You deserve it brotha `\Luke got a decent gig`\ET lives for turnaround midrange jumpers`\How many crab dribbles in that time`\Wtf was that lol.`\What's Clarkson's excuse then?`\The way this game is going you'd think it's the 4th quarter.`\Who the hell is this Huertas guy, and why is he my new favorite player?`\I can, I see it more and more every game `\What are the basketball gods so pissed at Memphis for?`\Game is getting kinda ugly. Refs gotta take control right now tbh.`\That IS the dream for Thibs though. He gets to watch all the film without the responsibility `\holy shit! I went to HS with Jonathan Gibson. before he transfered his senior year,  that is...saw that he was playing with Boston's Summer League team a couple years back. cool to see that he's killin it in the CBA now.`\I'm just going off of my memory, I'll wait until the streamable gets posted before I start acting like I'm sure of what I saw. `\You have clearly never watched Thompson play and what he brings to the court.  He is so much more than a statline guy.  He was fouled at least 5 times tonight on the offensive glass which is essentially 5 more possessions but doesn't show up in the box score.  Opposing teams have to throw extra bodies at the defensive glass just because he is down there which slows down their transition game.  He is also an amazing pick and roll defender and is improving as a post defender every day.

You keep looking at those box score numbers without knowing the entire story though. `\Hahahaha I love the clippers policy on the last person to the locker room has to dance.

I know Lebron's 3 hasn't been great this year, but he did hit a 3 the play before.  Thoughts on him in-bounding on the last play?  Getting a decent look with 1.8 is tough, but Lebron is tall enough and strong enough that he can get a relatively decent 3 shot with not a lot of room or time.`\Fourth Quarter Porter`\Fuck Russel is confident.`\Curry is definitely having the best season, but as tired a narrative as it is, I'm not counting out playoff LeBron.`\I mean, you have won 7 OT games`\Hadn't beat the heat since 2012.

It's insane to change a rule because 4-5 guys can't make their shots from the line. There's a reason why it's called the charity stripe. `\nice ball movement there`\I want to see Anthony Brown at the SG spot. I feel like he might be a potential mismatch at the SG spot as a plus defender with huge size for the position.

The potential of both he and Russell as a defensive guard tandem is really interesting.`\Shaq a fool, how you gonna ask for 50 lol.`\I know what game I'll be watching `\We can't make any traction `\Good game from Love

`\We look like the pre-ASG Lakers again`\This is getting fun`\Russell under the basket and no one knows how to move to the level of the ball

\#justbadcoachthings`\FIRST TEAM ALL DEFENSE`\Randle is going at Gordon hard for getting drafted over him `\Honestly, it probably helps to go in without any expectations. The Nets haven't yet found their team identity so I imagine that helps keep things pretty neutral. Listening to something like the Jazz is such a nightmare because it's literally complaints and excuses for 48 minutes.`\I don't even think that was a foul by delly tbh`\Kyrie filled up the stat sheet but I was generally unimpressed with his play in the 4th quarter. `\You're right. He'll probably be expected to perform just like he did during last year's playoff run. But, I'd say you're underselling Kyrie because he's going through a bit of a rough stretch. We all know what he's capable of and I'm sure he's aware of that as well. `\for the suns ?`\Damn where Stephenson get those post moves from? `\Let's get rkelly in there and call it a night`\Well I like how this game is looking. GO CAVS`\And the 82 Mill joke is still funny? was it ever funny? Whats the difference here`\So what are you guys eating and drinking for the game?

I got red wine and xxxtra hot cheetos...i stay classy Po Pimpin`\Looking good that quarter`\Yea they announced it late `\They gave the Lakers the basket and a free throw, didn't they?`\So glad Whiteside has been improving his game. Much more than just a shot blocker now. Free throws, mid range j's, assists?!?`\I agree but definitely not the same this year.`\Anyone else notice the cameraman JR hit was shaking pretty badly? I hope he's okay.`\Brace yourselves...



Playoff LeBron is coming.`\He was well behind the play. It was four on five for the majority of the possession.`\put in Len`\Looks like a Mr. Bean grin`\Well, we are really bad.`\**SWIGGITY SWOOGITY IM COMIN FO DAT BOOTY**`\It's kosher though, rabbi. `\We were 14 pts in the lead when he left the game.`\Kyrie- Not a good offensive game

Love- Didnt play`\Pretty sure it was late in the second quarter-I didn't get to see the fourth quarter but in the second and third it seemed pretty inconsistent, and really killed the momentum that the Celtics built up in the first quarter.  I might be a bit biased as a Celtics fan but it was pretty bad imo`\https://i.imgur.com/pdZFiYm.gif`\Why wouldn't he be?`\Are the Warriors and Spurs the only teams that resemble championship teams?`\Lol Ja.`\My tv must be fucked up...the TWC channel is just showing me a dumpster on fire

They were doing well.`\Hey look everyone these guys are saying D'Lo = Curry!!`\* Hope Clarkson's injury isn't severe... I'm not ready for more Huertas
* Russell with another solid game
* Mudiay looked good tonight, I wonder if this was his best game of the year?`\THAT'S A VIDEO NOT A GIF. THERE'S SOUND AND SHIT.`\This is so sloppy lmao`\It's not strictly stats. I've watched plenty of him and Harden has made much tougher passes than he has. `\your team will never win anything.`\YES TANK GODS`\wall on the cavs would be interesting`\that's so nice to hear, I really love his hustle and game (except when he pair with Kelly but it's not his fault)`\Not the best in the league, but I wouldn't say they are hard to listen to at all. `\Kyrie handles the ball so damn well!`\You'd think KG being there would light a fire under Wiggin's ass.  He seems pretty nonchalant about contributing.`\soo basically LeBron is amazing but everyone else is shit?`\Bad life for that one guys hair `\Everyone should be like LMA, and just delete twitter`\Roy Hibbert might suck at basketball but I don't think thats a problem Tucker wants`\God dang Crawford `\Good to see MWP is still up to his old tricks.`\Lol wheres Russell?`\I'm gonna be that C's fan who defends Smart. He's still really young and while *a lot* of his shots are misses, his form has been getting a lot better. I think he'll be a lot better on the other side of the  court next season.`\Ok time to put it Huertas, Sacre, the towel boy, and Andrews `\Jon Barry is a shit announcer, jfc`\I find it hard to believe Kyrie managed to yank Dirk that far, but that should've been a foul if anything...`\When ever we catch terrorists, we should tie them to a chair and make them watch this game

`\that's generous `\Marcelo catch and shoot now watch out`\A few people have...im pretty sure Kobe did but im not 100% on that`\The Panthers are good!`\This Cavs team is weaker than last year's despite the seeding. They'll probably still make the finals, but man they've been so unimpressive.`\Intimidated by our sheer numbers.`\Imagine a raptors Celtics ecf....that would be hilarious given the preseason prediction`\LOL tell me you're kidding. `\Julio on pace for another 3rd quarter double double. Who you sleeping on?`\Jamal had a pretty terrible start to the season from behind the line, that had a lot of people complaining about him. He's been good lately, so we're all happy.`\KOBE WITH THE CAKE BOMB

The Nets stayed competitive for 3 quarters

Then everyone fizzled out

Good night. Can't even salute the fallen tonight...`\That Randle block on Zbo.

Damn son where'd u find this??`\Why do Clarkson and DLo palm the ball so hardcore, damn. Love em both, but they reeeeeaaally push it with the carries sometimes.`\Except LeBron isn't leaving, he'll just have the FO trade whoever he is tired of to get his buddies.

`\Probably set in preseason`\You could see it ripple on the replay from the Cleveland broadcast.`\Because he's fucking good at shooting 3's`\1st thread is always better thread`\>~~Tristan Thompson~~ __Lebron__  is worth every god damn penny to this team.

FTFY
`\that sequence of events lol`\Lakers beat Warriors, Spurs actually lose a game, Cavs get beat by Tony Allen's 26 points? What is happening?! `\Holy shit

[And Exum has an X in his name too](https://imgflip.com/s/meme/Ancient-Aliens.jpg)`\I sense a Cavs 3 to kill momentum`\Uhm...it is league's better than fucking Cleveland`\"Should LeBron work out with Wade more often?"`\Clarkson being in is not a good thing for us.`\He actually hasn't tonight lol`\That's cute. You guys finally got past us in the playoffs. ��`\We need Carr and his beautiful voice to resuscitate him!

`\Triggered`\I know it's asking for a lot but imagining a Blake Griffin or Anthony Davis-esque improvement in the midrange jumper for Randle is hella nice`\Thanks fam`\Clarkson had to make those freethrows and knock Kobe off the scoring podium. `\The first guy did a link post`\Kaun is like bait. He will be gone in the next season.`\OLADIPO`\Idk about you guys but I'm enjoying this game`\Poor Delly getting a bunch of calls against him.`\>keep on winning despite the off-court problems

this is peak lakers`\39!`\How do you know? He's under a lot of pressure from physicians to sit and it's better to be safe than risk his life.`\Will the Thrill!`\Fuck DeAndre `\Woooow that was some garbage. `\No lead is safe with Marcelo out there chomping on it`\I mean, you're talking about the team that cries the most of any team in the league. It's their thing. I don't blame DJ for that. He's a follower. `\At least we know what to do when Love goes cold in the playoffs, Frye!!! This games sick...dont go Kobe :(`\Truth.`\Nastyyy`\Not too bad, 8 points on 3/10 shooting, 3 assists an 2 rebounds. `\I knew celtics had some smart fans`\Jae is brick city right now`\3angelo`\Hahaha Larry Nance making fun of the crossover`\Pretty dumb post since I've been watching the Cavs since before Z joined. He was never on Love's level. Love is a better shooter, far better passer, better rebounder, and can shoot the 3 and stretch the floor. Z was a better defender and that's about it.`\Definitely a worthy backup role player. Does a very good job handling the bench lineups nicely. Might not score a lot, and might not get a lot of assists to stuff up the stat sheets, but he can control the bench properly, unlike Lou. `\C'mon Kyrie`\BANG`\This is not normal`\3-Will`\MVP chants.. what year is it?`\Oh gosh.  Be happy for us Cavs fans!  C'mon!`\what do you think he had before the three point shot?  Post game was his only other offense besides mid range.`\Back to you mate GG`\Offensive rebounding!`\He didn't box out on a few key plays in the 4th though`\Well I wouldn't say they are playing like shit.`\Oladipo isn't some random wtf`\Golden State Lakers`\You're making a lot of assumptions. Stop projecting your own shit on me.
`\Don't toy with my emotions like that`\lol Byron is trying to tank`\To my knowledge no, but he sometimes does NCAA college basketball games and NFL games, both on CBS. Occasionally he'll hop on TNT as well to cover some NBA games`\Lead us, Vince`\Nothing. Just frustrated with this BMC4 dude. Why?`\I like this civilized game thread.`\Bruh if lebron wins another ring it's only cuz Jr saves him with  a bullshit 3. `\He's getting smarter at the rim. Learning to hesitate and sometimes just not take the shot instead of getting packed all the time.`\Go Celtics!`\No he's not shh.`\Damn Bulls fans all in on a tank?`\I think LeBron jumps ship to Miami after this season.`\Holy fuck I'd pay extra taxes to get Hibbert's remaining contract terminated. Seriously I could play better basketball than this huge pile of garbage.`\Randle and Clarkson are no better than Len and Knight (who aren't very good).`\Well, if Kevin Love is there, the 4 gets crowded. Also he probably is saving him there for any special lineups in the playoffs. it has to be more tiring for LeBron`\Ahh look, another great contest by a point guard on a shooting guard. Delly really isn't the fix to that issue.`\Fuckin Dan Crawford has always had it out for us`\LMAO`\Is that Deandre or Dirk on the free throw line? `\T_T7

Didn't even realize there was a game today... And they fucking won... Against the Cavs

Also beautiful work, I can smell that 8th seed upset`\Sad whenever it comes to one of the few games James Jones gets to play and Hubie isn't commenting only for the fact that he calls him Jimmy Jones �� how has no one ever corrected him on that `\This is a surprisingly entertaining game `\Man, Kobe is INTJ as fuck. Does that answer your question?`\The game was over man, who cares.`\YES`\Why does everyone feel the need to shit on Cleveland in order to make themselves feel better? It just make you look petty. `\kobe and d'lo were a combined 3/22... kobe with +/- of -44 wtf`\Surely 'point' guard is exactly correct `\This Kobe guy is pretty good!`\This was LeBron's fault?`\turns out he didn't`\we just make our 3s tonight`\first of all why the heck is the ball not in lebron's hand on each possessions????`\Wow..the Lakers are actually playing their whole bench in such a close game? Is this because they are trying to tank?`\Our starting backcourt is fucking amazing. A combined 49 points on ONLY 32 shots and ONLY 1 free throw. All that in 28 minutes from CP and 26 from JJ.`\Channing frye is prob more clutch than Kevin Love `\:(`\Awww you're so mad. Sorry I ruined your day kid. Typical trash ass laker fan`\man the cavs not winning anything with mozgod and love. Trade for robin lopez and Melo
`\They get any call they want smh`\Lol what do you got against Russell, they both had good games.`\Ahhghh my eyes!!!!

I can't see shit, it's too bright! The future is too bright!!`\Cleveland should let Brooklyn win anyway just so Boston gets a worse pick lol.`\You guys had more free throw attempts...`\This is unbelievably horrible officiating. `\Fuck off. Losing is for losers `\Got to say I did too. Seems like a good backup to D Rus`\Take THAT Curry!`\Then I'm sure many others can, effectively negating the point you've been attempting to make all over this thread. :|`\The Cookie Monster commercial is hilarious`\Tony Allen has *how* many points?`\You got your best players on and everything LOL`\wouldn't want the last game between these two to be any other way. loving this game so far.`\Kobe and Russ working the 2 man game `\it's a shame LEBRON GETS FUCKED BY THE REFS AGAIN. i am SICK AND TIRED OF LEBRON NEVER GETTING CALLS. `\Nice! Randle's doing work`\wth is happening how are we playing well two games in a row. `\༼ つ◕_◕ ༽つ Send them the tacos`\can't guard that JR swish any better`\Gortat not looking good tonight.`\You can't say something like that as a Cleveland fan...especially to a Boston fan.`\[grizzlies bench right now](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/tKJYhwHCz0Q/maxresdefault.jpg)`\Yeah, but they botched the second try. Cavs did play very good defense to be fair.`\Robin and Brook should just get the same haircut, so that if one of them doesn't feel like playing a home game, the other one just shows up.

I feel like that would go like this :

&nbsp;

*Brook Lopez didn't play well tonight but you can't blame him, the whole team is to blame for this loss.*

*RoLo balled his hear out, but it wasn't enough to win the game. I'm excited for our future.*`\>run away eastern conference champs

You guys are 3 games back. `\I'll always have a soft spot for Lance `\Fun fact, that's Kobe's worst +/- ever, eclipsing his previous record of -36 set just three months ago. `\That wasn't on him. That was all on Love.`\john doesn't deserve this shit`\Bro we are 9 games up on the 9th seed with 19 games to go. That would be a monnumental collapse. There is no way we don't make the playoffs. Im hoping we can keep the 5th seed so we get the Clippers first round. `\Yeah, I know this narrative is overused but honestly unless things turn around in the rest of the season and they figure out how to use Love, I don't see how he is on this team next season`\⛵️��`\At the end of the day Lakers, Heat, Spurs top 3 franchises in the NBA.`\So he didn't land on randle's head and get undercut, hows that not obvious? `\Wish Hibbert would dunk more`\Or the gods would take it as an insult and just punish us further`\Yes. Its the best way we can position ourselves going into the off season. 2nd worst record with a burgeoning youth core. Add a few more mid tier free agents while ideally holding on to that top 3 pick that can improve the team as a whole and an off season or two down the line we can probably entice some superstars. `\He should be fine, he was standing up. `\lol what the fuck`\Lance doesn't give a fuck he's so funny to watch `\What did I do to make every Boston fan hate me on this sub? It's a conference game between the 1st and 3rd seed and the two teams have a history. It's supposed to be a rivalry, who cares if some fans talk some shit? `\Actually, the Cavs might not make the finals with the way they're playing. I mean, the people at /r/nba says they can make it, but they don't look as dominant as last year, since there's Team struggles and bad chemistry (especially the Blatt firing and Lebron's miscommunication with Kevin Love and Kyrie Irving).`\He elbowed Harris in the face.`\Last time we got shit on by the Jazz Mike Brown got fired. *crosses fingers*`\I feel we are like looking at Sun's record and as long as we don't pass them we will not tank`\they are trying to work her in and it falls flat every single time. They even give her silence after statements cause they expect her to talk more`\it's weird to me to see Lue in a suit all the time, they should let him just wear a cavs jersey`\It's ok,  I didn't want to draft a blue chip prospect anyway. `\this ought to be the game of the year`\Good news is that the Lakers didn't have the worst margin of defeat this season.  Of course, they still have a few games left to play`\Clippers looking good this game.`\Fuck LeBron `\Honestly LeBron is letting Kobe play.  He's pretty late on closeouts and putting a hand up.  Good for him, though.  Lets Kobe do his thing.`\I guarantee you that Kobe is in absolute pain right now but is blocking it out just for this fuck you game

Hes gonna be sore af tomorrow

Dude is something else

He said his arm was clicking last game...so you know its fucked up`\you mean 180'd`\Well this isn't good`\You poor thing. I can't imagine what it's like being the run away eastern conference champs`\Haha fuck you kyrie `\The Lakers are kinda fun to watch

`\Take us home booker `\Its been that way the past 3 games lol...`\lol this is such a shit game to watch`\FINE INCOMING BIG BALLS NO NO`\And then in the last 2 minutes he makes the 2 FT's and hits a 3+1....`\Why you trying to fuck up our high?`\Only 1 company sells Viagra `\Ballmer and Mickey Mouse posing now`\[Picture of the Cavs during the game](http://m.imgur.com/W42MCKM)`\we know a little about that too but good thing we don't have to go back a few years to find a "big game"`\i was originally gonna focus on the game instead of finishing my homework so i just wanna thank the cavs for encouraging my academic success`\Kelly back in, someone tell Byron we don't have to tank anymore`\GAME WINNER CARMELO COME ON HELP OUR TANK`\lol this half time show
`\JULIES RANDLE TRIPLE DOUBLE`\How many years does he have to last I'm curious`\such a hard fall.`\Why you so salty`\No sheet. But we just spanked OKC last night is who I meant as the other team.

No single missed call makes any other one better than the other.  Celebrate the game.`\Irving 6-22
LeBron 13-16

Was Irving taking too many bad shots or was a really bad closing/night? LeBron taking two shots in the 4th quarter.

4th quarter stats sheet is incredible. Too many 3pts missed from the main guys... and Mcrae+Jefferson+Delly 3-3 from 3pt.`\I don't know why you keep replying and deleting your comments but I will paste here what I've already said.

They're literally the only thing the Nets have going this season. They also are so unbiased to a point that they genuinely get excited for plays the other team makes, which is one thing I love about them. They love the game man lol

Both them and our B+ team announcers commentated the game tonight so they were doing some sort of ping-pong switching in announcing the game which was kinda odd but cool nonetheless `\Sixers and Celtics fans collectively orgasm`\At the end of the game when kobe was hugging everyone. After walking off he ran back to see someone who was on the sideline in a hat.
Anyone know who that was? Just curious. I think it might have been JJ Watt`\I will never make that argument again after last year.

He was 4-14 tonight and 1-5 from three, and you want him to keep shooting? I guarantee the same people criticizing him for passing (which often led to another open look) would have criticized him for shooting while he's cold.

Whole team was off tonight, we're in a funk right now but it's nice that we can still get a win when we play that way. You could tell how much that win meant to this team, the bench was so hype at the end and everyone was playing extremely hard in the last minute, I can be proud of an effort like that.

Pacers are a damn good team. Very nice and respectful fans and while their players are always pesky, they give us a good fight every time. I respect the hell out of them. I said earlier today that I think Cleveland vs Indiana will be the ECF and I am definitely sticking with that prediction. Something about them make me feel like they're built for the playoffs.

When he becomes far better than he is currently`\Is Brook a top 3 center? I'd take Boogie, Drummond, DJ, KAT off the top of my head over him. Duncan and Davis have been centers this season too`\He yells so much during the game on every stupid play, then the silence when they lose is music to my ears`\Well, refs and some sloppy af play. I feel it should've been called, but we shouldn't have had to rely on that, we had other opportunities.`\
Not discrediting your team and effort, but that's a foul in front of the ref. They should have called that`\Get ready for a trip back to 2008 where Kobe could just score at will`\delly didn't have position of the ball. Free space is fair game. `\Today has been amazing GSW lose, LeBron gets beat by the heat, and we beat the Clips. `\Trade the pick`\NaCl `\In 2016 Kobe was double teamed `\Screenshot?`\Doc rivers always sounds like hes out of breath lol`\got damn`\What the hell is the point of a time out with 22 secs left and a 20pt lead`\K.`\You tryna post-up Metta?`\No doubt

damn thats cold`\Alex Stepheson, backup SF. The Clippers have a thing where the last person to the locker room has to perform a dance`\WE HAVE THE MEATS`\Riley loved Lebron. Pat was devastated when he discovered his plan was to go back to Cleveland. Not because of his team - The heat will be fine with Riley and Arison. It's Lebron James destroying his career when it could have skyrocketed that's so disappointing. It's the decision that will haunt Lebron forever. `\I think we're both very different teams from our last game. Whiteside's been a monster recently and has greatly improved his offensive game. He is averaging 18.5 points and 15.5 rebounds per game since the all star break. I think the rebounding battle would be a little tighter, and Whiteside could capitalize on offensive boards. Deng was also averaging like 20 and 10 since the break for at least the first 3 or 4 games, and we look great because of it. I think we'd be better with Bosh, but we're getting into our best basketball, especially since we picked up Johnson to fill that hole we had with outside shooting.

I can't wait to play y'all in a few weeks, I think it should be a really competitive game. I don't know if we can beat y'all in a 7 game series, we'd probably need a lot of luck and poor shooting nights from y'all, but I think with how we've been playing, I think Boston would be a better second round match up than we would be, assuming we make it that far, that was really the point I'm trying to make. Outside of Sullinger, they don't do very well on the glass and I think y'all could exploit that better against them than against us.`\I mean he's a real stretch four. He's like THE stretch four.

Combine that with the fact that you can't hold onto the ball for too long in the post anymore, and well, big men are fucked.

Tyreke seems like a very good comp.

>If we move north of Mudiay, we find some of the common comparisons for him: Russell Westbrook and John Wall. But Mudiay isn't an elite athlete despite the obvious comparisons. He's explosive, but he's not like Westbrook, who will dunk over a 7-footer in traffic. He's incredibly quick, but he's not as fast as Wall.

`\Nah, just resting. `\#39 as a ROOKIE`\Please take a moment to admire the great LeBron for the special talent he is. It never gets old looking at the King's history. So many accomplishments Kobe Bryant and Michael Jordan will never achieve:

1.Only player in NBA history to quit because of Air Conditioner.

2.Quit on his team the year after he promises a championship.

3.Dunked on by a high school kid then confiscates the tape.

4.Bail on the dunk contest 9 times.

5.Only able to win a ring with 2 superstars.

6.Play on same team as his moms boyfriend.

7.Average 1.8 pts in the 4th quarter of NBA finals.

8.Lose not 1, not 2, but 4 times in the Finals.

9.Host a national televised TV show to leave his team.

10.Go 2 for 18 in an NBA playoff game.

11.Get stuffed by a player under 6 feet. (Nate Robinson)

12.Flop every single game in the playoff 5 out of 6 finals games by dropping FG% by 18.
14.0 Rings if not for refs calling early fouls on Durant and Westbrook threw them out of rhythm, made them play soft, and sit for big parts of the game which changed the flow and momentum of the finals.

15. First person to show his dick and lose in a Finals game.

So first you didn't know that he does this type of thing, so it should be a lesson learned that you shouldn't be quick to call someone out for something cause you may not have all the info. But the reasons why you are getting such responses is because of the way you worded your response. It sounded harsh and belittling, which you admittedly wanted to get across. Secondly in a forum like this you should always welcome posts like that and not shun them because even if they are wrong it creates a dialogue of actual conversation as opposed to just posting a picture as a response. And lastly it does have to do with you having a cavs logo and them losing and then the reasons above make it seem as though you are angry and just lashing out at a heat fan. I have told people that they are try hards, it's really annoying but the difference is that in my experience try hards are trying hard but they don't know how. Like they know the lingo but not when to use it so it just comes across as stupid. `\For reference, Bradley/Love play happened 8:02 in the third quarter, Kyrie/Crowder play happened 5:52 third quarter.

The fuck basically?`\I don't expect us to win this game so the first part is definitely possible at least.`\Congrats, Lebron. `\I dont live in the USA they don't seem to work cause of that`\VC stay blessed`\fuego!!!`\Ty Lue: ok stay calm, just think, what would Blatt do. `\Channing Frye can do pretty much everything they have Kevin Love doing in their offense.....at like a third of the cost. `\Gonna be good seeing you guys win jack shit this year too. Stay ringless forver trash ass organization.`\Pretty rough commentary there...`\It feels damn good too.`\Pls beat Towns' game high`\Spo's right: that's a foul`\Leaving it on until we start ignoring defense and bruck a bunch again.`\Wish the Thunder would defend as well as Green did, we seem too scared to try to stop fast breaks`\Tony Allen, Mario Chalmers, and the summer league all stars defeat the Cavs in Cleveland holy fuck that was incredible. All heart, grit, grind`\Please anything but overtime`\Hopefully it's just pain from knocking his knee against the floor during that awkward fall`\That was the greatest game I've ever watched`\Russell doesn't even get to play the 2nd quarter. Byron's rotations are fucking ass`\Hasn't Bogut been injured most of the season?`\If it did happen though, then maybe I could believe the draft wasn't rigged.`\Wait are you actually taking my white priv comment seriously as if I'd know whether the original commenter was black or white?`\If I could up vote more I would`\It's not as majestic as dirk but it's the most majestic on our team so... No`\Glad we're back to our losing ways `\DAE HATE THE HEAT?`\Was that three blocks?! Or just two?`\salt`\10 years from now people will be wondering if Booker and Kobe ever even played against each other, and Booker will talk about this game. `\Brent Barry`\Me gusta`\Tony....you're scaring me.`\#RIP IN PEACE TACOS !!!!!! ;__;`\Thanks `\Inconsistent though. `\The refs taking away the points from the Pacers inadvertently made them lose the game lmao `\otto > hibachi`\Delly ain't chill man`\hey Lue read my post, Lebron is back :D `\Screw you Lue. Only 57 seconds left. `\John is using the power of Hibachi to fuel him`\Sigh. 9 losses by 3 points or less. Literally the difference between second place and being outside of the playoff race. `\Fuck I... fuck...

Man if Cameron Payne had more playing time he would be right there, his Per 36 numbers are pretty similar to both of those guys`\Nets win vs Lebron and new Thugger tonight? So so lit`\This is one of the main things where stats dont tell the story. Watch any game and it proves that stats dont do him justice.`\Wonder if hes gonna catch a fine for that`\Not everyone can be as pretty as you `\Go ahead and woosh me...`\[Post this](http://www.nba.com/games/20160318/PHXLAL/gameinfo.html?ls=eref:google:1b:post) instead. I usually go for the box score to see how certain players are doing. I almost always will look at a Lakers Game if I don't watch it to see how the young 3 cores are doing. `\Really it was 3/3 because one of them was him running backcourt after a nearly stolen ball and a half court lob.  So in intended 3's, he was 100% tonight.`\oh god lebron pulling out the dribble moves he never shows off any more and making shots like that. he's gonna finish huge tonight`\Celtics having trouble rebounding. Celtics can't rebound.  Celtics are getting the glass cleaned on them. Celtics think they can dress eight guys and win.

Get fucked.`\I'm getting nervous how many fouls were getting here.
Can't afford anyone fouling out. Period.`\jose off to a good start ...`\Still hoping Kyrie can throw up a few more assists and we can get our bench going`\Large fries`\# A Concise Game Guide for Tonight

&gt;&gt; `\Man, the Cavs homefloor used to be so hype in regular season games`\I'm really doubting he makes any kind of change this offseason `\My god Len is bad. `\lol temple is such trash smh`\THREESUS HAS RETURNED.

Kyle has been a monster since the end of January and I couldn't be any happier.`\Dangerous DRuss...absoulutely killing it`\You will have to settle with Durant.`\It's sad, but it's almost inevitable.`\CAVS GETTING POOPED ON`\Yeah, what did you think of that front page post about players being annoyed with kyrie's lack of assists?`\Thanks for taking the time to write it out! Much appreciated. Ugh, big bummer about Chalmers.`\Tons hopefully`\Fun battle from both, look forward to watching it again and again in the coming years.`\Its obviously Lebron`\*Frye's the key to all of this*`\let me understand this, Isaiah Tomas is a drive first-ball hog-PG that cant shoot free throws?
`\That's why he decided to get another one after that and then leave the court. `\They have a pretty good lead on us. I think we can maybe beat OKC, if Carlisle can find a way to slow Durant down, but I doubt it. No chance vs Golden State and the Spurs`\We have gotten blown out like this by OKC and the Spurs this season. The difference is we've won a game against the Clippers `\scary lookin with those eyebrows`\Gentlemen, looks like we have a good old fashion western standoff on our hands.

Both of you take 10 paces out and on my call turn and shoot.`\Damn Z-Bo! Please be ok! Hopefully he can walk it off :(`\He's on TV because he talks so much shit, leading to him being shit talked about. Its a shit vortex Randers. `\Cleveland Warriors out here! `\bron's nemesis, jj barea, is in the building. could be a battle.`\I'm enjoying the YES network commentators just talking about the Who Am I? quiz for the past 3 minutes.`\That looked like a charge, am I missing something?`\AND I WILL UPVOTE EVERY TIME FOR ALL OF TIME`\If there's one thing this subreddit needs its more low effort comments

I agree!`\say what you want about lue but this lineup is killing the celtics.`\Lol. I hear silence, so I look over at the janky stream which reads "assholefister69 is now offline"

RIP mister fister`\Its fun to see him against cp3 `\Wrecked with injuries and playing with d league players and yet Grizzlies win Cavs and Clippers but lose to the Suns. `\I hope Dragic got everyone in the Staples Center sick.`\yessssss, cleveland, yesssssss.`\Cavs are a pathetic franchise lmao`\good job Lou Will `\Thanks Grizzlies`\You guys beat the Warriors you can beat anyone! `\STOP LEAVING YOUR MAN OPEN WTF!!!`\Channing Frye is exactly what Blatt wanted from a stretch 4. `\JaM is gonna foul out again tonight if he guards Love the whole night. `\I was under the impression that you could hit the hand if you hit the ball first, not the other way around`\The tank goal is now not to surpass the Fakers, but it to stay ahead of the Nets.

This bodes well.`\How is this a discussion? T the man up.`\I can't even be mad at this, that was good`\So do James, Irving, Love, and Smith. That's the game.`\One of the best I've seen.

Actually, all the comments by Lakers' fans in here are hilarious. Took me a second to realize what you all mean by Kelly being "clutch".`\Not really. He's improved a ton since the beginning of the season. And honestly how is two 10-day contracts going to *hurt* the Lakers? Roy Hibbert has done jack shit in the NBA. `\Even though the Clippers announcers are trash I agree with what they said about Mudiay dude can get anywhere on the court just needs to finish.`\\#NBAMath`\haha stay salty bud`\JUST KILL EM `\And Steve Nash out of retirement.`\lol kobes final game at staples is also against the jazz...`\Ya...dude is still a top 5 SG.`\\*checks in not even 10 seconds later*`\That doesn't make sense lol`\Fuck yeah he did.`\Clippers need Blake to truly compete with the upper echelon teams `\just check new in like 2 minutes`\Lol "frye day" Freds got dad jokes for days `\HOLY BALL MOVEMENT! `\Box out dammit`\I just love my squad

and 2010 never forget

and Steve Nash `\WHAAAAAA??????`\oh Hey Clarkson, its nice of you to show up `\just a lil goofster and a bit of a gaffster`\Anyone notice Kevin Love has no confidence in his shot this season so drives with reckless abandon praying for a bailout call.`\the tank has been initiated boys.`\OTTOMATIC VS KOBE LETS DO THIS`\I don't know how he does it, but Tony knows how step up when we need it.`\This Notre and Michigan game is good `\thanks, man`\Where was this team 60 games ago?`\Dlo is going to be a star. `\oh thank God. I'm couldn't handle the Warriors patriots combination. But why aren't you a lions fan? `\Curry irving`\Dude I missed that Shumpert dunk in the game - thanks for that!`\sick of all this fucking bitching

the refs weren't great in the eyes of our fans. they made a few shitty calls but nothing major, but as every sports fan does, we highlight the annoying shit and ignore everything else.

Other than the first like 12 minutes we played like trash and looking for excuses isn't gonna cut it


edit: and while i'm at it, i'm sick of a lot of cavs fans trying to give us shit for complaining like we're the only fanbase that does it. every team fucking complains. you guys got the higher ground by winning, ease up on everyone else, makes you look almost as bad as the Celtics fans right now`\Pretty please`\Nick Young talking with Clarkson on the bench.

Clarkson is #TeamSwaggyP`\I didn't see last night's game, but the first game you beat us with Offensive Rebounds from two "7 footers" who are high energy guys. It seemed like y'all got every rebound in the first game`\sick bro`\They played *real* defense back then!`\Pls, no`\Soon...`\Yay because we had no other choice. `\I'd say both were in involved in this to some degree.`\Pretty sick ball movement. Wish they always played like this.`\YEAH! Great win Brooklyn awesome job`\Pathetic performance no energy `\Kobe with the super delayed all star game revenge.`\exciting af game for a quarter, then we still tank in the end. not bad, Lakers
`\The opposite of the Rooney rule in the NBA is the Sterling Rule?`\Why is the sidebar TV schedule wrong so often? I was excited to watch this one on ESPN. Wanted to see Magic Giannis.`\If Nick Young doesn't swing on Russell then tonight will be a disappointment `\*lebron fans `\xD`\give me a fucking break man`\[how i feel right now](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/BSfODmJIMAA4wgA.jpg)`\THIS IS NOT THE LANCE I KNOW`\I love how the response to an overreaction after one game is another overreaction after one game. Yeah, the contract will look better in the new cap, but saying it's a bargain? Come on. That's not true at all. It doesn't really matter in the end because the Cavs were over the cap anyway and Gilbert is willing to spend the luxury tax, but let's not change the reality here. Tristan Thompson is not worth the contract he got under the current cap or the new cap, *even if the contract doesn't matter to the Cavs.* `\Context is everything for these stats. Does MKG ever need to carry his team on offense? How much does losing him affect the team? Please don't compare him to established stars. You are ridiculously biased. Ian Mahinmi has a higher RPM than Anthony Davis. What does that tell you?

MKG is a good player. But I'm sorry he's not on Marc Gasol, Blake Griffin, Chris Bosh level yet.`\Lol no but that did make me chuckle`\Like having kyrie with the backups and letting him be Jamal crawford`\Dipo set his career high and it's only the start of the 4th`\lets go big panda`\Julius Randle is a bad bad man
`\Sorry you clicked A`\That ball movement

The Spurs could learn a thing or 2 from us`\I was there for games 1 2 and 5.  What an atmosphere. `\Frye's release is as quick as JR's`\ITS NOT A WIN/WIN IF KOBE HITS A GAME WINNER DUDE WTF`\WHERES THE TECH ON LBJ? YOU CANT HANG ON THE RIM.LIKE THAT

/s`\Real fuckin classy TNT.  Why not wait til we know what happened`\Looks at the score WTF, why are we winning ? Orlando pls ... -___-`\#LOADING...`\i remember this from before the draft. its actually a pretty bad article. in the first point for russell they credit him with originality on a set play that had been run a couple of times that season.

those comparisons are a bit off as well. as far as jumping ability, mudiay is right there with wall. again he doesn't have the straight line speed (although he is definitely much more explosive than tyreke), but again he makes up for that by being larger than both of them. `\They gave Kyrie the deep 3 green light `\Why would DJ even foul LeBron if he was just going to reach around so lightly`\That Love bank shot was beautiful.`\He's gotta perform a Ricky Davis`\feels like walls rookie year

"yeah we're losing a lot but at least wall is playing well!"`\lance is roasting LBJ`\it says the website is offline
`\It's because they did the fusion dance prior `\Jordan 5/7 from the line`\I agree. Klove doesn't make enough open shots or play good enough defense to help the team overall.`\or maybe you got away with a no call....?....`\Didn't they change it to give the refs discretion when the shooter intentionally jumps into a defender already in the air?  Or did I make that up?`\I love Vince Carter & I hate these announcers `\Unless you have a fantasy player on one of these teams, I don't understand how any non Knick/Laker fans are watching this game. `\ #NOSNITCHING `\Huertas is pretty nifty with the ball in his hands, but on defense... Jesus Christ what a disaster`\WE ON AN ULTRALIGHT BEAM!`\Daaaaamn.  And if I recall correctly, they were *barely* over .500.`\First 20pt outing since February 2012, and only his 4th 25+ point game.`\I think we're all go for ingram at #2. But anything's possible. `\honestly, 2010 game 7 was my favorite win of all time.`\All in all a pretty solid game.`\TACOS BOYOYS

WE CAME OUT TO PLAY WTF

HOW DOES HUERTAS WORK? HOW DID KELLY AND BASS NOT GET SHITTED ON?

༼ つ◕_◕ ༽つ Send them the tacos`\This would be a great game usually but of course the league would schedule this the same time as GSW/SA. Would've made more sense for this to be the 5pm game and the other one is 8:30 game`\Lol even the Lakers put up more of a fight than this.`\LMao again Mozgov bodying up K Love`\Rondae is bae `\Tristan is up there too. `\Fuck, it was fun while it lasted, congrats Cavs and the refs`\No way we're younger than the Sixers.`\Had a 20pt game a while ago`\spurs, cavs, warriors, and raptors all lose in 2 days. woooowww`\We definitely brought this loss on ourselves but that logic is just so shitty.`\We needed that win.
Well done, kids.`\lol delly called for giving a piggyback ride`\Here you go. Look at how late LeBron closes out. Kobe is already releasing shot when LeBron puts his hand up. Go pause at multiple iso situations with Kobe.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_wL3k3px09k
`\I agree. I'd give Lou and Kelly away for free tbh. `\R Kelly the unsung hero`\double double for Randle`\I don't understand this, why is delly taking those shots and handling the ball this lineup is so dumb if Irving doesn't have the ball.`\The ball movement all game was awesome to see. I'm liking this ball moving Cavs team. `\Seriously, we have to have the biggest free throw deficit in the league.`\wtf Metta`\Almost went to the game for $8 tonight, didn't have time in my schedule. We're really taking a hard hit, us fans. `\Or 2009

Heck or 2008 `\If we can keep Bass and get Simmon/Ingram and just get a decent big, Lakers can make really good run next year with our big 3 and Nance`\Nope, only a non-fouled miss counts.`\NBA is going the way of a Harlem Globetrotters vs Washington Generals game. They're just short the 4 point circles near the halfcourt line 'cause curry is already providing the circus shots.`\Similar to watching that Cavs 3pt shooting eh?`\He grabbed him  and shoved him out of the way. They missed a bunch of fouls all game, but that was very clearly a foul.`\lol, the generous home scorekeeper`\Sun announcers anger me`\A MARQUEE MATCHUP`\yeah, there's no way those ping pong balls stick the lakers with the fourth pick, right?`\Clippers bench other than Crawford, is straight trash`\Dis  dude do dis to us in our last Home loss.`\Does the Lakers arena announcer have a lisp?`\those are nice seats`\"if dirk is such a great shooter why'd he miss that open 3"

`\chamomile tea `\that hairline`\Take a shot every time Whalen says tough`\Cleveland has done very well in big games under Lue. Beat the Thunder, Spurs, and Bulls (Bulls/Cavs is still a "big" game, rivalry wise)`\HE WENT FOR HIS NUTS THE FUCK

LIKE IS IT HIS NATURAL REACTION WHEN HE IS AROUND MEN????`\Didn't he get injured though?`\both our bad play and this awkward Whalen commentary. `\The Lakers boys in the studio shitting on em LMAO`\R. Kelly making sure that the tank goes on... LOL this is too funny`\Well, a bad show from the team. Randle, you did good tonight. Byron, i hate your stupid rotations and keeping Huertas a lot on the court. AB, i have so much faith in you, and from game to game, i'm losing that. I really need like 20 points from you man.

On to the next game i guess.`\some might say he has a beautiful mind`\D'angelo has played the most minutes tonight out of anyone on the team so far.`\BTW why is Kaun still on the roster? I'm sure there must be someone equally as cheap but more valuable.`\He has never been able to pronounce Redick his entire career for some reason. He also calls Pau Gasol "Paul."`\1st team all defence baby`\So you're going to rely on bad calls to win a series against a team? Sounds foolproof. `\first team all...offense?`\DAMN`\:( Hibbert chasedown block is unacceptable for us`\Chef Channing fried them on the pan today`\Richard Jefferson guarding Vince Carter?

What is this, ball at the old folks home?`\Hahahahaa holy shit...wtf was that Suns?`\Whoops, that was supposed to be a 3. Oh well`\nice dime`\But lost to a utah team without Gordon Hayward.

Hayward > LeBron `\31 Points!`\Sometimes I hate the anti-circlejerk knee-jerk reactions....this however is not one of these times.`\Those guys aren't playing? Nets by 8`\Another one.  Looked like a spear tackle.  `\Forgot I can just switch to the CSN stream, fuck ESPN`\This is some 2k-level shit`\starter back in game, but we keep Kelly in. Out of all bench we let Kelly in`\Gotta agree. He's doing the other stuff. Hope he gets a triple double soon.`\OH BABY`\Why couldn't they just let Whiteside dunk the ball LOL.`\6-8-12 for Randle. Triple-double alert.`\This is awesome.`\RIGHT as Teague whiffs `\I really wanted this game to be close `\I guess you didn't watch the end of the our Memphis loss`\there's that magical 120...w`\This is incredible`\Why the Bayless hate? Just curious.`\oooo the bron 3`\Hey to be fair Orlando City's stadium is in the middle of Paramore and I haven't heard of many incidents there`\probably exhausted. 2nd game of a back to back`\RJ with the stone hands tonight`\he does more than just rebound man`\Randle blew by Kyrie ��`\damn Kobe that fade J is so good `\This is my favorite `\RJ Hunter and James Young were supposed to be able to shoot, but they haven't shown it.`\Did LeBron just step over Russell?`\Birdman is out also.`\Kyrie hooked him.  `\Is it just me or is this the longest halftime of all time?`\Derozan tying that freethrow record tho`\[Lol](https://streamable.com/n4og)`\Damnnnnn Chris back at it again!`\They're letting Rondo hack Marcelo like that?`\Marcelo's death squad just ran out of time. Suns starters bout ready to choke that one up`\Kobe must know that I dropped him from my fantasy team because I couldn't rely on him playing every night :( `\3LO`\I'm not the one making the decisions, the Great Bongo from Congo is.`\Turner can just shoot over Delly too easily.  `\cmon kyrie we know you can dunk`\I hope they lose every game now after firing Blatt. Blatt was the man and lol at Tyron fucking Lue thinking he can coach`\im sorry can we not talk shit here?  this is sports.  fuck the clips`\where's the post game thread? I need to shit post`\AH WHAT A FUCKING GAME.`\No, but a win tonight would make for some nice ESPN headlines and TV segments should they meet in the playoffs.`\It's how Warriors fans must feel, just shoot a random 3 and it goes in, beautiful :')`\It's like watching your ex-wife's new relationship fall apart!`\For a second I thought they weren't going to call that bow.`\McCallum dgaf`\I love these "no one is safe" nets.

You just causally asked him? lol`\They're not exclusive. You can do both. `\I;m not sure Nene respects anyone. I imagine him not even knowing most of these guy's names.`\Someone has to think they are.`\The haters can't even handle a joke`\lmao huerrrtas`\Have faith in the grind my friend `\That's a shot Russell probably should have made.`\Boban is the best front court player on the spurs`\His tattoo's are his tattoo's you don't have to like them, they are emojii's of course they look bad. He got pulled over while having copious amounts of weed and mdma in his car however he wasn't driving and because of his status I'm sure he appealed his case at a lower circuit drug court `\man 81 points on 60% shooting god damn`\Wiggins goes 9/10 when trying to clap his hands.`\His play in Cleveland has had some bonehead moves, but he's a so much improved than in NY. It's not so much the stats as it his the body of work.`\Brookyn,

we go hard`\I guess DJ has been working on some new moves damn`\go away`\Still don't see the fuss over TT.

The fuck has happened to the cavs since the all star`\Fawk I got so scared.

It is the overposting, doesn't matter who it is about. `\ALL HAIL THE LELBRON GIF OF DESTINY`\everyone saw your shame gogi

EVERYONE`\Has DLo played at all in the 2nd quarter? WTF Byron?`\I hate Lebron. `\ABC has some of the worst "Comedy" shows. `\Damn dipo.`\Cavs got fucking dicked on. What are they going to lose 40 if Bosh comes back?`\"I'm abouta put the paws on you"

That arm flail was identical`\Lol pulled the chair from him`\LeScorelessinthefourthquarter

Doesn't matter how hot you are if you decide not to care down the stretch. You can shoot 100% from the field and still be the reason your team lost if you just refuse to shoot when everyone but you is cold.

13-14 Finals all over again.`\*yawn*.... no one's disputing that, wise guy`\When someone's rebuttal is "lol no he's not", they're not worth arguing with.`\Bass got to jump to intercept if he's choosing to front. I think he could've got it if he did`\Youre welcome guys. First laker game ive been able to watch in a while and DLo going in.`\Actually, he seems happier according to people that ran into him. He has also lost weight. Kate Upton is probably happy to have him at home.`\ah sorry man :( the best I can tell you is whats in that thread`\10-10? Damn`\LANCE!!!!!!`\yeah he should have let go `\What... the fuck... did I just watch?

And why is my life more complete now?`\Not too many dudes in the league that can guard Hassan when he's on.  Unfortunately both of the best teams in the West do have those guys.`\He has a player option`\Wtf is this`\Why would that matter? That was my point.

The guy said LeBron was the reason you didn't get swept. You disagreed.

I don't disagree with that. Without LeBron Cleveland are a very different team.`\Udonis!`\I give it two weeks before Alan Anderson is starting for Otto.`\Thats like a 10-1 odds `\KOBEEEEEEE`\Our guys are getting tired; we aren't moving as much and now it's showing with our poor passing.


Good thing DLO will come back in soon and hopefully will help Huertas get the ball moving.`\I stopped watching. I couldn't take it any more.`\He is still stuck being a trash brother while JR has evolved to decent`\Please...I've been with the Pistons and the Lakers in their darkest times. Pistons haven't been to the playoffs in 7 years and Lakers have been out of the post-season for 3+ years`\Didn't like Jerryd Bayless get fined? `\playoff lelbron`\LAKERS BEST TEAM IN LEAGUE

WATCH OUT NEXT YEAR

First we beat the warriors

NOW WE GONNA SMACK THE CAVS

HUERTAS GOAT




LETS GO LAKERS


BYRON SCOTT COTY next year
`\towns lol`\so bad they held rose to 3/11 and 8 points this year and then beat you`\Jeff green and clips bench mob stink on defense. Also prince luc Richard mbamoute (lol sp I know) looks straight out of the early 90s with those worthy glasses !`\Ya, averaging 5-6 assists per game means he's so not a team player.

Ever think maybe that was what was designed and he was told to run?

Edit: Kyrie is 7-12 for 16 points in 17 minutes.  He was 7-9 before the run the mavs went on.`\Rick Carlisle is a crazy genius. Masterfully coached down the stretch. Unbelievable game management.`\Gg cavs. Weird pace game. Not all that concerned, honestly.

Although y'all just played the entire fourth quarter without Kevin Love, it feels like.`\I think Lance has finally found the right team for him. His game and the grizzlies culture are a perfect match`\Very little chance`\wtf clarkson omg`\Mudiay has been really good tonight`\Shit, ouch. :/`\I think a lot of people wondering the same thing `\Grizzlies looking good tonight. Love the energy`\ilu`\He never said the cavs are worse than the grizz. OKC has lost to their fair share of shit teams too.`\If we're gunna win, Booker should at the least show out to make it entertaining while we wallow about our diminishing lotto odds`\http://m.imgur.com/Y0Ck6?r`\That shit was sick. I really hope someone got a picture of that. `\I've never been so happy for a Lakers win`\Mbenga, Powell, Farmar, Vujacic, Brown, Odom, Walton, and Sun Yue.

Not one is having a decent NBA career atm. They were great role players though I've gotta say.`\Lol blake gettin shit on. Reminds me how excited I am for first take every weekday`\at least he knows how to do it right and he's fun to watch no matter what he's doing lol. little white kids on the other hand...`\It's the Cavs dude - did you expect us to hold/extend on a 20 point lead in the first quarter? This game was designed to be close from the beginning, and the Cavs just did their part. Now we play close ball for the entirety of the second half. `\hmmm never heard this before`\They got superstar bojan bogdanovich`\Let that be a lesson to you that no team beats the Los Angeles Lakers by 50 points!`\What a time to be alive`\lol yall were already attracting them with all that Kobe money opening up and being in LA`\I saw that shit too lol. `\what about her?`\Russell next Derrick rose before the knee? `\Frye has such a weird body type.`\Stfu TT`\Yeah it's telling we go 'big' with Gorgui yet still get killed on the glass`\Lakers over Warriors last night
Pacers over Spurs
Grizzlies over Cavs

???`\Jazz don't win without him.`\"Once you're engaged can you still fool around with the other girls?"

I love our commentators `\Kinda like the heat of the moment "not 2..not 3..not 4.." but people are still shitting on him for that.`\The Nets are double teaming Russell the way teams double Curry.`\Which he does, frankly, an alarming amount.`\And what should he do with the pizza?`\MANdle`\Clarkson giveth Clarkson taketh Clarkson giveth again`\i laughed at this`\El Heat coming for that ass.`\I know we're losing, but nothing about the way the Cavs are playing right now is even remotely intimidating.`\[This is what I imagine Wiggins' hands look like](http://i.imgur.com/HyvMJoh.jpg)

(don't worry, it's Crisco.)`\So...? If signing TT for more or less doesn't change any variables of the team's cap situation, I'm just glad we have an owner that's willing to pay all the taxes to keep a contending team. Many other teams can't really say that.`\Melo is in the 45th in PER. Might need to be more selective...`\damn, i was hoping we would be the only ones that gave them that historic loss.

i guess that makes us eskimo buddies?`\I've never been happier

Splash Bros 3PT shooting: 1-18

D'lo & JC: 7-12`\he's 0-4 for today. overrated shooter`\Melo had a quite good run past few games against the Bulls but he looks so bad tonight. Do Knicks fans want to keep him for next season?`\yall get way too reactionary. Just chill and watch. Cleveland isn't going to shoot 16.9% from 3 forever.`\Damn, that pass`\**WWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW**ine and Go**LLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLL**d.`\Thats why I mentioned Clarksons years in the league which I believe is more important to your development than your age. Clarkson played 4 years in college, which is 3 years that Knight was learning from NBA coaches/players/minutes.

I have nothing against the Suns players, I'm just not worried about the Lakers future.`\I don't like to hate on young players, but Randle needs to get it together. He's like PF Shabazz Muhammad.  `\mods`\I hope it's close at the end of the game just to see who on Cleveland is going to be he one to take over. Probably Kyrie tonight since he's been so good`\Right, losing to the 8 seed in the first round with the MVP on your team isn't a choke.`\GAMETIME BABY FLAIR UP HOXBROS

CAW CAW`\what the fuck? metta wasn't even looking at that ref `\Oh man we aren't the only team forced to play Ryan Hollins this year`\You act like big men in the NBA have to "grip that tight" to palm a ball. `\Plenty of nba players aren't that strong. Kyrie doesn't look that strong, I'm sure a lot of people can bench more than him.`\Beal just exploded`\oh yeah, he's hot`\This game is a lot closer than I thought it'd be.`\Par for the course`\Weird half. Starters played well, bench was shit, where's elf`\He was just dunking on eveerybody`\It's LeBrons seat for his back I think`\Didn't want to pull a Mozgov`\LeBron yelling at coach! Cut away!!`\hate to break it to you but if our young guys keep balling out we might not keep the pick`\I don't think I'd call JR Smith a "good" defender. He gives a lot of effort though`\Cavs love playing against LA teams ;(`\Looks like we came to play`\TONY WHAT THE FUCK`\aww baeff`\100 key and peele`\fosho thx`\holy shit`\did lebron just dance again? lol`\Cavs vs. ?????

Why you downvoting? The whole starting 5 is out...`\Why is Wiggins scared to shoot right now?`\So?`\Dang...  Nets look great right now.`\Fuck The Bulls`\Refs you suck at Staples Center for the Clips???? So proud of our fanbase right now man.`\bad ankle sprain this is going to keep him out the rest of the year.`\Secretly McDonough is celebrating. He told Watson to keep Knightmare in so that the Lakers can keep their pick and make the trade look less worse`\Damnit..`\Not when he's on my opponents team then I get pissed `\This is how we unravel. A missed call followed by a transition bucket followed by a tech`\That was nearly a perfect game by the Cavs, it seemed like they hit 25 threes or so, and if they missed, TT got dem offensive rebounds.
And Jr Smith hit like 5 360 no scope threes damn, great game by Cleveland`\So return to Browns/Indians status`\Holy fuck Cole Aldrich is still in the league `\He's literally the reason we lose to Spurs and warriors every game.`\R. Kelly coming up big in the clutch!`\The last two teams to win the title without an MVP (either past or eventual) are the Pistons and the Pistons. So I'd say a guy who is at least getting MVP votes.`\It was our Tank Commanders birthday. As a gift to Byron we presented him one of the greatest tank games in NBA history.
`\WHAT THE FUCK TONY ALLEN`\Until they win a championship, yes.`\TT played great but Lebron just came out and fucking crushed it tonight man, didn't seem like anyone else had the same type of urgency as him tonight. I gotta say he's easily the best defender on the team, he pressures so hard and makes plays happen on the defensive end, the rest of the team is really bad at D. `\i said "maybe" brotha`\The crowd here is chantin "WE WANT KOBE " lol`\Marcelo a tough motherfucker`\I think Shaq's natural register might be the brown note...`\**PLAYOFF BOUND**`\then you'd know that evan turner in the post is money..`\Gets a little iffy in the 2nd/3rd, still good but not as good`\He said he has bad knees. It's actually kind of sad.`\Only after the prophetic blindman blesses this with his holy upvote are the masses allowed to chime in with their announcements of upvote donation. `\Why are you getting downvoted so hard? Because you don't like the Celtics? Fuck the celtics`\CHYYEAA. Grit. Grind. Win`\Losing some close games which is a really bad sign. There have been some bullshit calls/no calls but we really need to be able to close out games more effectively.

You can't blame it all on one play but it's pretty shitty that there was no foul called when Lance tackled Delly on that jump ball.`\haha alright Calderon`\Doc needs to give Green more playing time.  Paul Pierce shouldn't be in the game if he's struggling.`\#YES. TAKE HIM!

Edit: we'll take a late first rounder for him and no give-backs!`\Doc Rivers would make a great spokesperson for Halls`\Still down`\Something something fuck LeBron.`\Dallas looks pretty good out there. Imagine what they could do with a rim protecting, elite rebounder. I feel like thats what they should have went for in the offseason. `\Only a double double? I expect 20 and 20 at half from him. `\First it was the raising of the roof.

Then it was the weird tweets.

Now the dances.

LeBron is such a dad, omg.`\Just about every other game. `\Good to know, thanks!`\Well, he is a career average 34%-ish 3point shooter. So that slump was gonna end sometime.`\JR Smith is 30 years old?? The hell`\Good lord, all of the Lakers shots rimming out`\Mudiay vs Dlo part 3`\How about don't fuck with the starting rotation with 1 month till playoffs? `\do it against the spurs and warriors scrubs. lol lakers.`\wtf Ryan Kelly is suddenly in the game? wtf is Byron doing?`\Beat the Clippers.... Lose to the Lakers... ConfusedNickYoung.jpg`\Plus with the tank war we can afford to win it too! Phoenix is way behind`\How does 30 for 30 always come up with such good titles? Impressive really`\ayyyyyyy`\IT BABY `\Why does Lebron have to do everything right now? Let's go`\I wonder if Love can sleep at night after scoring 7 points and a rebound as a max player`\what`\Unpopular Wizards fan opinion but Oubre is gonna be soooooo much better than Otto`\Beating LBJ doesn't count unless it's in the play offs... trust me... :(`\We should keep LeBron at the four and have Love come off the bench. LBJ is obviously better at the four`\damn Carmelo`\I must be retarded, how do I use the reddit stream? I normally watch the games on TV.`\That would've been far worse.`\they are intentionally trying to lose... thats why.`\talking about the production as a whole as well...most other local announcing teams are like a high school production team in comparison`\What a set of games tonight. All 3 games finishing at 9:30 have gone down to the wire`\Cheers`\wtf Randle? Literally got out of the way for Kyrie's layup`\Because it clearly wasn't a burn lol`\I will take it as long as we get to play Spurs, take it to game 7 and win by either a Joe Johnson 3 or Josh Richardson 3 at the very end with time running out.`\Brad would destroy Kyrie, especially with Shump guarding Wall`\I could turn Cleveland's economy around in a month if you let me open some salt mines.`\Mavs: Would you like this W?

Mavs fans: Hell yes!!!

Mavs: Fuck that`\Cavs are lucky we're resting our star Alan Anderson! `\lol Suns are so trash`\dammit, clips. if you're not going to help our playoff seeding i'm going to watch the big short instead. come on!`\He was playing the ball...but that looked fucked up lol`\Nah man he'll get more minutes if he makes those 3's `\Yes after having one of the hardest schedules and still have the same record as a team with a cupcake schedule its nice to finally get some easy games.`\Man hibbert is shit`\Fun lobs at the end of the fourth with DJ! `\Lakers could steal this one `\I expect that's a fact that magic fans aren't too happy about`\Grizzlies - Clippers is going to be an amazing 1st round series.`\ESPN announcers suck dick, going back to csn`\Kyrie should be getting the props IMO. LeBron balled out and singlehandedly kept them in the game. `\I knew I should have gotten drunk tonight. `\holy fuck JR is on fire`\Oh Jeff Green. Always there... when you don't need him`\russell is gonna fuck up the tank again, isnt he`\Fucking legends man. God dammit. `\Ohh what the fuck guys`\The jazz are a streaky team, and any way we can get momentum, especially on a home stand, is good news`\Who says swampbutt lmao`\wall or cp3 for best pick and roll player?`\No its cause they just didnt call it`\Man, lately I feel like we could play against anyone`\Only if you hate knowledge of the game `\Look how much better they are without irving.....`\I wonder how Tyler Johnson will fit into this rotation once he's healthy. He was beast early in the year.`\Celtics fans can complain about the refs all they want, but it's hard to take a lead when your opponent is shooting 60+% in the qtr

Edit: What did I say that was untrue?`\C'mon Grizzlies, beat the Clippers! `\That one year contract is looking genius.`\That was a technical win in every sense of the word.

The Cavs were the better team that night`\a lot of people have bought inflated cost lakers tickets to see kobe's last season. I think a lot of them are genuine`\nah can hit all hand there`\It's funny because isn't he having the best Heat 3PT% month ever?`\Please don't miss layups. `\Where's the kids tho?`\Thank you ;)`\Kobe gonna give it to ya`\GET 40`\Lmao.. Bron's really trying to force the isolation on Mbah a Moute.

He has to recognize he doesn't have the handle for it..`\I don't know if my audio is dead, but it sounds like they're playing in front of 5 people. I swear the average american makes more noise at the theater than at a sports game.`\And still won by 33? That's amazing!`\lol`\Yes.  Anyone who had a good game last year in the finals not named LeBron was a fluke.  The team played like shit other than Delly in two games and LeBron was the only reason we didn't get swept.`\Clarkson is garbage`\Find someone who can do both lol`\Tony Allen was the only Grizz player who showed up`\Ice in his veins :D `\RJ is so washed lol`\shut up ESPN`\Lol he tried`\32 points in 24 minutes hahahaha`\Think about what you just wrote, 3rd overall in the league behind he two teams having some of the greatest seasons ever. The Easts depth is actually a lot better than the west this year. The West has two teams in the playoffs sub .500`\God damn kyrie `\HASSIST!`\Im guessing thats a Celtics commentator? Never listened. `\[Zach Randolph can ball seems appropriate](https://youtu.be/SqY-QqiFl0g)`\Yeaaah, Kyrie isn't cutting anyone up tonight lmao.

Huertas & Randle crowding him.`\Huh?`\You forgot to put the final score in the title.`\wtf call was that?`\Cavs win

Media: WHY DID LOVE ONLY PLAY 23 MINUTES? DYSFUNCTION IN THE LOCKER ROOM. BLOW THE TEAM UP. `\Even though it's Kobe's last game in Utah, it's not the Laker's last game in Utah.`\I really hope we don't throw the max at Barnes this offseason.`\I got a KIA Sol as a rental this week. Its pretty spacious. Not enough power. No hampsters in the back seat so I was disappointed `\Yes please`\I wasn't impressed by csnbayarea's pre and postgame analyst panels, maybe I was expecting too much considering that there really isn't too much to fill time with, but I was expecting a lot because of how well the warriors have been playing`\Ssshhhhhuuuuunnnnnnnnnnnn`\Holy fuck that pass!`\I like a line up of Kyrie/Jr - Shump - delly/Lebron/Love/Frye`\Nah man...in the 90s, Mavs players used to come to my school to work out before and after team flights.  They're strong dudes.  Their muscle distribution is misleading because of their height.

And if you know anything about Mavs players in the 90s, I'm not talking about top shelf basketball talent.  `\God damnit`\Get that /s outta here you're saying true shit`\guess our 3rd quarter collapse has arrived early`\Did Lee not score the same as him?`\omg every time Breen makes a joke Hubie laughs like it's the funniest thing he's ever heard i love it`\Man what an incredible game. As a heat fan I can't complain about a single thing tonight. Everyone str8 up balled out tonight.
The highlight of the night was seeing Goran fail a dunk attempt.
Gg cavs fans. See u again hopefully.`\Hands up in sports, especially football, almost always means they know they just pulled some shit and hope no one saw.  `\what does lebron keep laughing at`\God damn this comment is beyond savage.`\Lol of course him and Kobe are gonna play the end

They gotta face up 1 more time`\Don't be ridiculous`\Or jj`\wow Moz!`\Klay IMO.. `\Yeah odd timing I'll be switching back and forth. `\celtic fans and players silent`\MY BODY IS READY`\Only been here for like a week why would he care yet. He's just happy to get some PT since he didnt get any in LA `\Oh me oh my ! BINGOOOOOOOOOOOO`\Regardless of how the game is being called, lots of fouls kills the Celtics ability to run, which is probably their best aspect as a team.`\And the rebounds could be reasonably expected to re-increase to his previous levels -- 6 rebounds was down from last year where he was a pretty consistent double-double threat for a while.

That said, it is worth acknowledging the small 7 game sample size on those numbers.`\You weren't watching the Knicks right now?`\DLOOO TACOS!`\We believe, also `\Keep winning!`\Brook Lopez's miss from point blank against the Warriors at Oracle...

Dude is almost 40 but he looks like a good basketball player still.`\Yeah it is frustrating, but the season is almost over deal with it`\Ty Suns, hope Nance is alright.`\Does Shaq look a shade darker than normal tonight or is it just me? `\I'm actually happy for David Blatt he is just living life stress free while collecting those cavs checks.`\Metta suddenly remembered that the Lakers needed to tank`\Good god what the Nets are doing is NOT basketball`\Love is having a great game `\This is gold haha`\Lead us to victory Goonfather.`\So which Cavs starter is going down this time? `\"Poor LeBron"

Lmao what?`\It's obvious you don't know what you're talking about lmao`\Lets go Lakers beat the Cavs and make more rumor lol`\Everytime Vince carter makes a 3 he runs away like sonic the hedgehog `\if it was blocked why was there a 24 second violation?`\Yes, Russell has been better post all star break. I'm not denying that. Through the year it has still been pretty even`\Wizards:  Not guarding the baseline against the Cavs since 2006`\Witt played Temp for 20 fucking minutes.

I'm sure 2010 had your favorite Celtics wins in earlier games so Ron Artest could rip my heart out in Staples in Game 7.`\Any flair bets tonight?`\In case anyone was wondering.

Leuer lit him up all night and he pretty much waved at Booker on every drive. I think he'll be a good player down the line but if he's not stretching the floor,  defending the rim or trying to stop guys on the PnR,  it's going to be hard to find a good frontcourt partner for him that covers his deficiencies. `\SAY SECAUCUS`\I'm not the biggest Kobe fan, but man the NBA is going to feel strange without him.`\I hope this turns into a Lebron-Cp3 duel`\We'll see.`\No worries xD`\Game time boys`\Hahaha Jokic faked out JaKarr good with that pass.`\Lol Hastings hates being asked to rate players yet Marlowe does it every game!`\It wasn't that long ago that y'all used to be a joke of a team, maybe try getting off your high horse there.`\This lineup out right now is odd, LeBron at center?`\But the defense will last forever haaaa`\U DA real mvp`\By that logic, we're the best team in the league!`\Beating the Warriors and the Cavs in this season would be the championship.

#LET'S GO LAKERS`\I never thought I would find myself cheering for the lakers.`\just a bad team concept. We have the potential to be good on defense. But holy fuck our rotations are ass.

PHRASING!`\Made of fucking cristal`\WHY DO YOU HAVE DOWN VOTES???  THE HELL.  I also miss him.  Sigh.

I must emphasize I miss the way he was in the last couple of weeks with us.  Not any other time.  `\good work phoenix, you killed 2 birds with one stone with this win`\Hope you get it too. Dallas needs a huge slap back into reality.`\Neat`\I like shitting on the Cavs. `\20 20 20 for Lakers trio`\I'm coming dangerously close to having to explain a joke here`\we're fucked`\Not easy to beat the Cavs when the game's outcome has been dictated before tipoff either.`\No, I'm sorry but blaming the refs is an excuse horseshit teams use when they play like horseshit. `\I completely expected this loss.  The Cavs play down to their competition all the damn time.`\PIMP PIMP`\Well our shots aren't falling. Hopefully that changes.`\Wow nice`\LeBron makes moaning sound, automatic foul. yessss`\I love Kevin, but he hasn't been playing well tonight. `\Yeah, but you can't just keep saying 'he'll find his shot soon'. I think it always seems in losses that Lebron is the only one that is doing something. Don't know if this is saying something about the rest of the teams work ethic or their skill.

No excuse for this loss really. `\JAEEEEEEEEE CROWDERRRRRRR`\Both his girls getting it tonight, sweet Lou is on one.`\Len and Archie MUST play the whole 4th for us to lose.`\Worst loss in Lakers history is pretty historic, you could do a special Kobe x Russell combined lowlights `\Someone better streamable that Alley-oop!`\Weirdest kiss cam I have ever watched.`\Conversely to that, I think for his last game a video of lowlights from his whole career as a true sign of respect in the "roast" style would be pretty cool.

He isn't quick, but he's smart and he's taller than most people he guards, so he uses that to his advantage. He's still not that great though.`\Fire Rambis?`\I fucking hate this attitude exhibited by Mavs fans over the last two weeks. Yes, we've played inconsistently, but stop saying "fuck ____."

Why the fuck would he do some weird shit like that?

So many questions`\No one really thinks so. Roy was a not-so-risky pickup that we kind of hoped would've had his resurrecting season this year, but it didn't exactly work out that way. Unless if he wants to act as a backup role player, i don't think he will be worthy of starter minutes anymore. The dude is just so slow for a fast-paced league, and doesn't rebound very well. But he's a great locker room guy to have.`\It's like they're professional basketball players. Or something. `\To be fair wasn't his hamstring injured?`\Welcome to the 2015 season. How are you?`\Yeah I guess I can't argue with you he did hook him a bit, but Dirk sold it so much it kinda ruined it.  In the end we pretty much agree though.

aside from PP and his regular aggression, doc doesn't really use the SF position much. wes, jeff and paul had a combined 8 FGA before paul's first points of the game.

could the issue with the SF position just be that Doc sucks at getting that person involved?

If Lebron was genuinely unhappy with him and if, as has been alleged, Blatt was too soft to try and reign in GM Lebron then I can understand pulling the trigger, even if it still leaves a bad taste in my mouth. I think the chaos is a perfect storm created by multiple factors- Lebron's erratic behaviour this season, Kyrie and Shump coming back from injuries and struggling to get back to where they were, Mozgov toiling with injuries and being made to look a fool on pick n roll defence, Kyrie and Love's below average defence even when healthy, and I often wonder if Lebron's talent is also a curse- I genuinely wonder if players 'forget' how to play when they don't have him on the floor zipping them insane bullet passes and drawing all the attention from defenders. So yeah, the coaching thing can't have helped, but I don't think this game goes any different really in the universe where Blatt is still coach. `\He too, couldn't hit water if he fell out of a boat`\This idiot just private messaged me the N word because he was wrong.

the wiz adapted ok on defense at halftime but the offense was bad throughout. temple/otto together is just a mess, especially with dudley now coming off the bench. the team was clueless about what to do against the cavs' switches

on the cavs' side, they were fantastic. lebron needs to play with 3 perimeter players, point blank. kevin love is skilled, kevin love is talented, and his defense isn't fatal against 27 or 28 teams. he and lebron together will never not be suboptimal`\What a save!`\Sounds familiar. `\I think Delly might be the best shooter on this cavs team.`\Put in our bench to get some rest for starters, well shit.  `\Reading your comments is nauseating.`\JR Smith for the last shot?`\It was so embarrassing.

And even if I did, you're holding such a grudge to remember my posts from months ago? That's kind of weird dude.

Cavs/Celtics is a rivalry, trash talking is supposed to happen. Sorry, here's what you want, I suppose:

Good game CeltBros! Your team is super scary! I hope you beat us in the playoffs, LeBron is just not classy enough to beat the Warriors!`\Why the hell do you always get downvoted whenever I see you on /r/NBA?

Please tell me, how is wiggins NOT way more one dinensional than kyrie.  Again, dude cant rebound, cant assist, cant defend, and is not an efficient scorer.

`\That sounds like it will be incredible now, but that is a horrible combination for the shits. `\Lmao you must be dumb as fuck to keep sticking to your weak ass argument.

We also beat the Lakers without him IIRC`\Why would lemonade count`\#ironically `\why does barry's commentary sound so bias.`\It just seems you're salty about David Lee's praise as it will direct influence Zaza's mins, who I am assuming is your favorite player.. How about Lee's TS% right now? Carlisle has stated in a recent interview that he will get more mins so he will get even better than he is now.`\It's literally that tho. He tripped or something, alone with the ball and he's left leg collapsed.`\atleast y'all dont suck`\I can't decide whether to watch this game or the GSW/Blazers game...

http://www.nba.com/tntovertime/?ls=iref:nbahpt6a`\There you go Tarik`\Dipshit color commentary guy, forget hos name`\After that win over warriors, we all pretty much think that. The best thing about this new lineup is that D'Lo's confidence is growing, Clarkson is taking the sole spot of 2, constantly rotating around, and better ball movement that basically starts with Huertas. You can see why we do better without Lou just by looking at the last few wins.

The thing is, after another game or two, he's gonna be back. As in, back to the backup role, and he'll take a lot of shots again. And we'll be back to ultimate tank mode unless Huertas stays in as the primary back up guard.`\which is a good sign for his longevity `\Are you a comedian? If not, you should be`\Oh Z-Bo how I have missed you!`\Seriously. He won't ever become an All-Star if he doesn't fix the stupid shit he does`\This Lebreon Jamis guy looks like he could be good in the future `\Pistons 3-2 over cavs first round, confirmed.`\doesn't appear to be working`\jesus he's on Fryer`\Huertas was a vet that really never had any trade potential to begin with. He is a 32 year old rookie on a one year deal that has never played in the NBA before. They were overplaying Bass, Hibbert, and Lou Will because they all had contracts that made them decent trade pieces. Huertas at $500k/year isn't going to entice a contender that is over the cap and wants to alleviate some salary.

Now you're seeing the young players play more often, and as they get better, you'll see them play in lineups with the DEEP bench players like MWP, Huertas, Young, Kelly, and Sacre because it forces the young guys to be more self-reliant and makes the team worse overall. It's a low-key attempt to continue to tank while developing the young core. It just hasn't been working out for the tank because the core is playing so well.`\Shooting the fucking lights out`\This was so fun to watch`\LOL

LOL`\it's been one game lol, let's not extrapolate that much `\Okay Lakers, you won. You're the worst team in the Western Conference.`\It's all about getting one more point for the land
`\Point Hibbert.`\Play Russell 48 minutes. 40pts incoming.`\fuck yeah....chair dude!`\Somehow Love seemed much more athletic when he was fat.  `\Fair point lol`\I thought itnwas for another ISP. Wasn't expecting playstation`\/r/nbastreams

I need you to *feel* it.`\Oh yeah he was definitely milking it`\If the score was reversed it would be Armageddon in there.`\Since there are no highlights it must not happen right? Lmao`\Stevens need to bring Amir back in. He's playing right into the hand of the Cavs with this small line up.

Says a lot about this team.`\Mirza reaching hardddd he stirred the pot a little`\Booker with another game high plus/minus,  nice. `\Let Kobe shoot!`\Yup. DeMarcus was standing right under the hoop as we just scored. He turned to run back on D and Kevin Love was running by him to get the ball to take it out. They almost got tangled up, and Cousins very slightly pushed him, kind of a "hey man move" kind of push and Love completely over exaggerated it and fell to the ground and they called a foul then announced they were gonna review to see if it was a flagrant. They showed the replay on the arena and everyone was booing pretty damn loud. After nearly 5 minutes of them watching film, they announce "the call has been over turned and there is no foul at all!" And Boogie was smiling like he was thinking "no shit!" and the boos were pouring down on the refs. They were fucking horrible`\D league is so underutilized lot of players that can help a team if teams used their D leagues wisely. Spurs and Heat use it the best.`\Whether he was going for the throat doesn't matter for a flagrant 1. Just the contact alone in a dangerous area is enough.`\Lol that's not a foul.`\Oh definitely, it sucks we were robbed of that matchup last year because of injuries. `\wonder what his on/off rebounding numbers are with him`\why russell, he turns it over and then is lazy getting back`\Not gonna lie, part of me kinda wants to see this happen.`\Yes.`\FTs were 17-2 in favor of Cavs that QTR. There were at least 5 or 6 calls that were wrong and in the Cavs favor,`\That just happened, right?`\Real question...are the Wizards on the way up...or have they hit a plateau with this group? They don't seem like a team that really matters for the future of the east.`\Lol Harris' chin fouled Russell's elbow`\What did he say? lol`\Next topic on ESPN: Lebron sits to start the second quarter, what does this mean for his future with the Cavs?`\U D!`\Lol what was that LeBron?`\Lol oh yeah? Both NY teams coming up with improbable wins`\https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNLdG4r4QL4`\I really hope we can draft Hield and then trade Monroe + pieces for a decent rim protector in the offseason.

What a classic tank battle. This is Sherman v. Panzer all over again. `\Yay tarick's in!`\Felt like I haven't watched a Magic game at all this month because i've been super busy plus stupid Bright House decides to make random channels be all pix-elated and staticy so I can't watch on my TV when I do want to watch games.

It's tremendous defensively (when focused) and on offense it's a monster.`\>YOU CAN'T HANDLE THE FIRST TEAM ALL DEFENSE!`\The Memphis bench still looks pretty sparse :(`\Now LeBron has to stay `\Yeah true, it just sucks, we got burned bad in that time they were out.

If he misses 81 shots in his last game I'll make lowlights for ya `\He should have passed it back to Horford who was wide open.`\nar its probably worse than this haha`\we used to have trash offense too but things got weird`\lmao seems like it. `\MACHIN3`\ok it's a 21 point game, let's get Kyrie out of there`\Something like 75% 3pt shooting since the all star break!

He knows he's underperforming. It's gotta feel shitty when the back-up is hitting threes better than you.

I bet he gets that ball and thinks about the shot. He needs more confidence in his shot. Catch and shoot, click click boom. `\they are getting their shots`\I'm really seeing how local car commercials can get watching the Cavs stream. TBH I don't think I've ever seen a car commercial with snow.`\Let Bjelica run point forward.   We've been wanting to see it.  Misused/injuries killed his season.`\Not easy to beat the Cavs when they shoot 50% for the game and around 60% in the 2nd half. Cleveland outscored the Celtics 103-68 after Boston's solid start, the Celtics were awful defensively and the Cavs beat them on the boards. Well deserved win and nice to beat a Celtics team that I do not care for, to say the least.

Shumpert with 12 pts 15 rebs today, really good game from him. Kevin Love had a rough game but everyone else played really well. `\JR gonna JR....and Bron gonna Bron.`\GODDAMNIT THE CAPS JUST LOST AND I SWITCH THE CHANNEL TO SEE JOHN WALL ON THE FLOOR CLUTCHING HIS ANKLE.

Bitches are weird...i almost envy your ability to settle down

`\Ha I told my girl he's famous for being the Lakers Douche`\Where's that idiot that was talking crap about the lakers not being competative?

On some level, I understand it, but it's still not something that should happen.`\It's pretty simple. When, and only when, you're the court, the points that are scored go onto your plus-minus total. Obviously you get + points when your team scores, and - points when the other team scores So with Kobe, it meant that the entire time he was on the court, his team was outscored by 44 points.`\Have a fucking game Roy Hibbert`\Honestly, I'm kinda surprised he hit that. The jump shots he's actually been hitting this season are the ones where he doesn't have time to think about it`\Yes it was very clear, he still had his elbow bent at 90 degrees when the red lights went on the backboard.`\Yeah we get LA refugees in droves.  Must not be able to afford those $2k studio apartments in the ghetto.`\Hard to criticize PG too much because he was great, but there was a weird play late in the game when JR Smith fell to the ground after a free throw miss. Pacers got the rebound and were immediately out on a fast break but instead of running with them, PG stopped and helped JR get up. Pacers missed then the Cavs quickly got it back down to JR who hit a wide open 3.

PG....WTF was that!!?`\Fucking Kobe`\8-5-12 for Randle. For people saying he has tunnel vision, he leads the lakers tonight (and tied for Huertas) in assists and rebounds. Seems like he's improving, and he might get a triple double (if not, double double) depending on whether he plays the 4th quarter and passes well.`\The season starts now! `\Jesus this is a brutal game for Jeff Green`\Do clippers fans hate Jeff Green yet`\WHITESIDE GOT AN ASSIST`\WHY THE FUCK ARE THEY STILL TALKING ABOUT THIS

WHAT THE FUCK`\He seems pretty smart so no `\Beat both `\Jeffrey Demarco Teague!`\I know Lebron is under a lot of pressure, but his teammates can't be inspired when he's that visibly upset and frustrated at them. `\No`\You left out Community. It was in the same two hour block.`\Jr Smith's shot is straight up ART, it's so smooth and good looking I mean cmon..`\Can we get Russell more touches?

Most of them are defensive rebounds (which is fine) but thats why you guys paid TT all that money, for the rebounds. Kevin shoot be able to specialize at scoring, and he is piss poor at it right now.

He is not good on defense, he is weak at offense. Not a good combination.`\yup, his shoulder is acting up again. `\He hogged it until the last second.......stays true to Byron's words of wisdom.`\Exactly, that's why he qualified his statement by saying "if they can do this normally."`\http://i.imgur.com/ADnKbZl.png?1`\I feel bad for LBJ, dude played his heart out tonight.

Wait, why does my flair look all faded? `\there wouldnt be any controversy, TT couldnt play for anyone else. the problem is they sacrificed a small amount of flexibility in case they need to re-tool in the future, which it looks like they might need to do with the warriors being so dominant AND having cap space. the cavs kinda pulled the trigger in y1, which almost worked if love and irving didnt get hurt, but this year they regressed and other teams got better, so its not the same. `\mudiay's got something to prove tonite `\Half our team is injured outta nowhere`\http://giphy.com/gifs/boards-kobe-bryant-AYY3CIyxWnfiw`\Sw4ggy`\Rip tacos`\lombardi's then rice to riches for dessert `\THE AMOUNT OF GRIZZ FLAIR HERE PLEASES MEEEEEEEEE`\THESE TEAMS SUCK `\Do Lakers fans still love The Machine?

Better than putting fucking Huertrash in there.`\He looked great tonight. I, do have a question. I am still trying to figure out a couple of 3-pointers at the final two possessions. He shot 1-4 from 3 for the game and is shooting a career-worst 26% from 3 for the season. Yet, he will still dribble down the court and just launch a 3 from the top of the key, resulting in a quick turn of possession. Wouldn't it be a good idea to start deferring to your teammates on 3 point shots more often, if he knows he isn't shooting like he used to?`\If we could draw fouls as much as we fouled we'd a contender.`\I kind of like seeing VC just post up JR.

Absolutely- Cavs fans have been having similar disagreements about Kyrie since he's come back that he's a weak link out there because of his defense. When we play quality opponents and our bench isn't shooting lights out there's just nowhere else to look for consistent offensive production.

We contenders now`\Do the Cavs not want the 1st seed or something?`\I missed the fourth quarter. Did Lebron quit? He barely took a shot. `\Amen. I don't know what the network did to Doug Collins but at times he's total cringe material now. `\LOL. "what. the. fuck."`\TIL averaging 15/9 in the NBA means you're awful`\Is there disjoint between cavs. Lebron leaving the cavs to party with Wade middle of the season. Lebron is going to leave Cleveland again.`\He shouldn't have lost all of that weight then`\Pretty sure Doc's esophagus is 100% scar tissue at this point.`\Offensive phenom Tony Allen `\I'm just here for the drama`\Keep telling yourself that`\So far his contract has been more justified than not. He has been pretty consistent and solid all year. People are too reactionary. `\i bet the plan was for him and anderson to each only play one game of this b2b`\ESPN marketted him as the second coming of christ before he even play a single NBA game, so most of the overrating is from them.


and oh, ESPN was the one who ranked him 3rd best player of all time, seriously? the guy just stand in there during defense.

`\last matchup between delly and Kobe...  it's been fun watching their duels over the past years....

now it's time for Kobe to pass the torch to future great maturity Dellavadova `\Do a high pitched scream so we can hear you.

Loljkdontdothat`\There's a reason we have an L in our logo`\Incredible.`\Amare had 12pt on 54% shooting in 24min.. David Lee with 11pt 67% shooting on 4 less minutes. Stop being so salty about your favorite player zaza's minutes decreasing and give D Lee credit. When he gets more minutes when this season progress he'll easily pass Amare on offense seeing as he's at his level now already.`\So Chalmers didn't get fouled? `\He helped up JR instead of joining the numbers on a fast break.

Edit: JR, curse your sudden but inevitable betrayal!`\yeah...wouldn't want to say his name though....because /r/nba will think we're saying dlo = <that player>`\HOLY FUCKIN SHIT`\Last I heard he was on blood thinners again so he can't play, but I've heard that it isn't as bad as last year. It is starting to feel like he will probably have to retire, I haven't seen anything about him recently and it is worrying me.`\Oh and shitting on CLE is?`\Effort?`\sure fuckin feels like it. Helps when both teams are shooting sub 40`\he does most times`\THIS GAME IS HYPE AF`\Hack-a-Thabo incoming?`\I'm fine with lou being out. JC just got an injury and we played hurtas too much.`\Give it to Marcelo goddamn Lou`\Nice.  Seems like it would be fun to catch multiple teams whenever you wanted.`\Let's dispel once and for all with this fiction that Byron Scott doesn't know what he's doing. He knows exactly what he's doing.`\He's not. You know what I said.`\Delly and his awkward lobs... haha. `\I just watched Tony Allen make a 3.


Woah..`\People are seriously sending you fuck you pms? What the fuck`\It's not when he got in place, it's that he moved obliquely into Kyrie's path.  It's a very borderline call but it's not as straightforward as people are making it out to be.

Probably was a charge though.`\Are the cavs commentators known to he bad? First time listening but jesus, crowder had great position`\Porzingis is gonna be so scary good.....`\He always shoots and makes one early, then bricks the rest.`\that's an ambitious pass, otto`\I am so sick of hibbert. buy him out and give tarik all his minutes.`\LeBron with his black shirt while everyone else is wearing a red shirt on the bench.

Fit in, not out! :P`\Lmao Lakers complaining about the band wagon`\Clipper bench partied last night `\Yeah, the coach being Jewish is a completely relevant point in your analysis. Good job`\# A Concise Game Guide for Tonight

>> `\Yeah.... that turnstile then dunk against Jordan was cool though`\2 straight fouls on lebron not called. Then a foul on Delly not called. What are these refs smoking?`\why do the suns post len up so much???`\well looks like we dnt have a chance at this one.  cant win when dj is makin every free throw and everyone is drilling contested 3's and the refs are completely one sided.  im salty so i guess ill find solace in this by watching the clips shit the bed pathetically once again in the postseason.  like clockwork.`\Their backup PF. He didn't get much playing time last season because Joerger kept playing Jon Leuer over him for some reason`\anybody else sweating a parlay like a chump rn? cman heat`\Imagine if the Lakers win this game....`\Mmmmmmm double double...animal style

Randle gonna make me fat`\Randle would get killed at C`\is this original pasta`\If only he could hit this threes. That would make him such a good player.`\Been a while since this has been updated`\Frye needs it, he gets a little confused in our offense. Glad to see him being able to get some decent minutes tonight.`\Dad dicked`\"It's always been more like a big brother, little brother kind of thing between LeBron and Kobe, they weren't really that big of adversaries." `\Lol Kobe has been doing the same move for like 6 possessions `\Bad night for Elk & Elk`\Warriors lost worse to Dallas without steph (or was it draymond). `\How did JR play? You know he's been visiting some old haunts in NY for this visit, right?

edit: 8 points on 3-10	2-8...`\Thank you for the optimism friend :) ^^^Seeyouintheplayoffsbitch`\Len or Randle? Who do you pick?`\Huertas is cuter than Delly. Turns out this is an unpopular opinion.`\we signed him for two years right? `\Well they are still missing Blake...`\Check Harden's assist numbers bud`\thank god they don't have that guy matt weiner or whatever his name is on tonight for Ernie... that guy is so strange to me`\Active hands by Julio. STEAL`\I'm not claiming he'll be a star.. Simply that his shooting will improve. `\I found Ortegel kind of annoying. Unpopular opinion. `\There was even a play where he pushed Shump while setting a screen and they called Shump for a foul. `\I'm not even mad... Where was this team all year, and where was *Huertas*`\Damn I always forget that`\Why are they analyzing Lebron tweets...jeez`\And getting most of the minutes, yeah. Good scorer, but he just needs to have limited minutes. `\Kyrie is 23.  Both have only played for trash teams before last year.`\Holy shit Tarik IMMEDIATELY produced when he came in. Got a good stop on Jokic then a nice pass out to JC for a 3 `\nice shot dude`\The Warriors lost to the lakers too -_-`\Damn, i thought the game started at 630...wtf

Go Nugs!`\I wished this wasn't a tank year for the Lakers`\oh yea i don't think their games are similar, i was just commenting on saying wall is a significantly better athlete. he's significantly faster, but that's about it. `\He has joined 2 teams, (Heat then back to CLE), and the teams after he joined made big changes on his arrival. How are you trying to draw similarities on 2 completely different teams and offenses after the changes are made is what I am getting at.

Why did you delete your first comment anyway?`\see ya tonight romeo `\THAT PASS :O My stream couldn't follow it`\Funny thing is this is how huertas was playing in preseason.

Smart and quick decisions with the ball. `\lmao Vince with the matrix move`\Wat`\I hate Delly with a passion`\THIS IS AMAZING!!!`\Good start so far... hope we can keep it up `\Forgot shumpert existed `\Is K Love a DNP--Resting from getting dick punched in on the court constantly or something?`\My bro had one, he's said it was pretty good. I'd eat it.`\Ikr, I'm ready for that to be over. Dwight does it every game though lol`\Kobe is currently composing a love letter to the Cavs defense for taking ten years off his life`\You must be talking about Boban. `\Wallace just fleeced Doc Rivers on that trade!`\It's like he intentionally wants to make it close. `\Bucks are going to be gooooooood.`\If you're actually from Toronto, you're probably not familiar with the term.  It's southern.

Houston is humid as shit, hence the swampbutt comment.  `\The Cavs aint winning shit with that pathetic ass defense

Shoutout to everyone on our team for ballin out tonight`\lol we this ain't gonna be a close game if the lakers keep leaving their man open. `\He's fine. It hurts trust me, but he'll be ok.`\Shit, well at least I didn't get my hopes up this time, I knew we were gonna lose anyways :/`\> to prevent insecurities from setting in.

It doesn't seem to be working very well.`\yes`\Why does it even matter? People that provide content like this make /r/nba the best basketball forum on the internet. Props /u/Number333, like always.`\[best part of the game](https://streamable.com/s5vm)

`\I accept I hate LeBron for no reason at all `\Ian Eagle, hmm, familiar name.. Did he used to do NBA's Daily Zap or Top 10 or something?`\Foul too many white guys on the floor.`\oh that's horrendous.`\They're gonna waive off the bucket because of that!?`\Truly lol. Trying our hardest to lose right now.

I'm okay with it tbh. Can't win this game after beating Brooklyn last game

I'm still trying to figure out what Denver's excuse is LOL`\That was a real floaty floater`\He is out tonight.`\Celtics not understanding you cant just maul people because they are in the paint.

EDIT:ooh baby yall mad up in here`\dont `\I think he should have played more with Randle for more entertaining pick and roll dunks.`\and that's AFTER we get the championship this year`\Totally different though. Wade won three NBA championships w/ the Heat and has never played for another team. He was also a perennial MVP candidate and had one of the greatest statistical seasons of all time.


Brook has only played for the Nets, but his biggest success was a second round trip to the playoffs. He's never been an MVP candidate. J-Kidd, on the other hand, brought the Nets to the NBA Finals 2x. He was, like Wade, a perennial MVP candidate as well. Yes he started and finished his career outside of NJ, but that doesn't disqualify him as the greatest Net of all time. If Brook, who I love by the way don't get me wrong, doesn't have that MVP quality season or lead the Nets to at least a ECF he just can't be the greatest Net of all time. The most loyal? Without a doubt. Will he be fondly remembered by every Nets fan? Of course. The greatest? He's got some work to do. `\We like him a lot, Randy doesn't. Like, he's not very good yet, but he's better then some of the guys that have made the rotation during the year. The stretch he played for us as a starter and a role player he was ok and gave 200% every single play.`\��`\It's been a beautiful game of us making that extra pass and our guards just being on fire right now.`\Let me elbow you in the throat and see how you feel`\Back when the Suns actually had a home crowd.`\LeBron and Kobe matching up is so much fun`\i never left`\DJ KHALED`\Man part of me is really digging Rozier. He has been solid for all of the last few games he's played. His style fits well. `\[Julius tonight](https://youtu.be/h4UqMyldS7Q?t=1m20s)`\Cavs looked like shit through a lot of this game. Seems like they weren't even running plays most of the time.`\lowlights incoming?`\http://youtu.be/SqY-QqiFl0g ZACH RANDOLPH CAN BALL`\Flair up my man`\Holy shit Delly is just getting pooped on by everybody tonight`\It's a different make-up so it makes sense. I won't lie, I miss some of the hype behind the Heatles but this current roster got like the perfect mix of veterans and rising talent.`\close??? open til 3 am here :D`\oh my god that crossover`\I agree it's not helping but that reaction seems to be deserved. There may come a point when you run out of pep talks and angles to view it positively and you're just left thinking "fucking *come on* guys"`\But Cavs can, and Smart gets a tech for pointing out the inconsistency. `\Don't take it too literally`\Lance's emotions are either going to win them or lose them this game`\He's like your Alex Len.`\i love this shit`\Hopefully Frye has earned himself some playing time. He's been getting very little as of late for some reason.`\There we go...`\Who cares? D'angelo worked through the benching, earned his playing time tonight and made the most of it. I'm just hoping we get to see more in the future.`\JR vs JJ shoot off is exactly what I never knew I wanted `\[Yo LeBron]
(http://nbatitlechase.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Dwyane-Wade-Smiles-At-Lebron-Struggle-Face.jpg)`\This Boston bunch isn't built for the playoff wars that will come. Nice scrappy bunch... but, I think reality will hit hard soon. Isiah Thomas as your go to guy in half court playoff basketball....yikes.`\[Kobe's post and toast featuring Clarkson's dance](https://streamable.com/kyr5)`\This is one of the best 12 minute performances i've seen from Chris Paul right now`\every so often`\I'll never not get goose bumps when seeing those Wade/LeBron alley-oops.`\It's a rivalry. `\How did we give up that lead :/`\Was at the game. Dirk got the befit of the doubt way too many times tonight. `\I am the /u/MadManAmbrose of Basketball.`\Looks like he rolled it hard`\Marcelinho~`\I'm quitting on the team if they ever trade Nance Jr.`\This is why I hope they don't play Detroit in round 1`\It's not a Cavs game if Mozgov doesn't end up on the floor because he fumbled a pass`\I think Lebron envisions this going forward. Play 30 mins per night... let Kyrie do some heavy lifting against teams like this and run 40 per night. Kyrie is young and entering prime...`\DAE 2/2/2`\I know Randle made that and all but his tunnel vision seriously bugs the hell out of me`\Nah we're good`\The fact that a 39 year old is playing meaningful solid basketball at 15 MINUTES PER GAME is absurd. God bless VC`\Boston plays at that up and down tempo because they don't have any half court scorers aside from Sullinger. Its a smart coaching move. That will be exposed in playoff time, when tempo grinds to a halt and everything becomes halfcourt. OK Jae Crowder...go get me a bucket!`\lets not forget the awful cavs announcers

That's even worse than talking shit on your own teams thread lol `\occasionally`\rusell is still on the bench`\Holy shit this shitty stream stops every 30 seconds and has to be refreshed but yet I am still watching, most frustrating thing ever goddamn `\Grinding out wins in the East isn't always fun.  I think Kyrie and Love would rather play at west coast pace...`\The Hornets are 7-2 since the MKG re-injury.`\Getting torched by Allen, a guy where a viable defensive strategy is leaving him by himself and letting him do whatever, is pretty bad.`\Kobe aint fuckin around tonight`\Hopefully Clarkson wakes up`\You guys have a bad loss every 4/5 games. `\It's like noone really wants the W.`\The ONLY reason Cleveland snaked this one was shitty officiating. That no call was the game-changer. Fuck all of that.`\Bulls will finish better than 8th`\Laker v Lebron games were always hyped up. Especially during 2008-2011.`\Im not trying to over exaggerate, but i think Huertas is gonna get a quadruple double`\I don't know if it saved his career.  Maybe it saved his career with the Lakers.   You know the Spurs would have snagged if him if the Lakers released.  `\what a game`\busy week and i havent gotten my basketball fix, until tonight that is. lets go cavs!`\ROZAYYYYY`\Lebron: 13/16

Also Nets fans: When was the last time you heard a hearty "Brooklyn" chant, whether organic or started by the in-arena DJ?`\I watch for the young guys (and kobe) and pretend everyone else doesn't exist`\Lauvergne's hair is so beautifully shiny, I'd enjoy shampooing it with Johnson's baby shampoo.

Curry is the most popular athlete since Jordan and there's a reason for that. It's easier for casual fans to watch transition dunks and 3 points than post play. The NBA at the end of the day is a business and if this style of basketball attracts more casual fans them they're going to keep the rules the way they are. `\Lol Cam `\FINALLY A TIME TO BE HAPPY AS A LAKERS FAN.`\TA you beast`\I wish we looked like pre All Star break. We're actually not half bad. `\What a perfect outcome.`\The Clips are bound to cool off from a near 60% shooting clip but we're not going to close the gap if we keep shooting ourselves in the foor with sloppy TOs.`\Really says a lot about the 76ers. `\I know there's the whole thing about overrating the attractiveness of white NBA players.

He sits at the very end of the bench, he's never in the team photos or videos...

HOPEFULLY WE WIN`\He's literally the only guy on our team that hasn't played like hot garbage lol`\The Suns will win, I guarantee it. `\Cavs just playin angry tonight`\MWP loves to bake! who knew! loving these insights`\That's one word for them...`\To the Mavs fan it looked like a foul, to a Cavs fan it looked like acting. Kyrie touched Dirk's arm in getting around him but no way he caused Dirk's head to jerk towards the complete other direction. `\They will if these refs have anything to say about it `\13-16 30 points 6 rebounds 5 assists he is in his head yuh`\Nah,  but I wanted to share `\Can we make the playoffs?`\Yeah that's why I admire dame so much. He just takes control off that team. I feel like people rib him because he isn't a good assist man but there are no potent offensive weapons on the Blazers besides him and CJ. Dude has to do it all himself it seems`\We did beat them. But they also beat us the other 6 of the last 7 times we've played. There's no doubt we're in a better place than we were last year and can make it through a round or two but it'd take a serious show of optimism for me to say we're winning a series against the Cavs`\Damn the Lakers aren't even trying on defense`\At least it wouldn't be worse than having the second worst record and ending up with the fifth pick in Durant's draft.`\From what I've seen of him in interviews and what not he seems like a pretty cool dude.`\gg`\Wow did Mitchell really sit Towns for the rest of the quarter? Comon now! `\Sad game tonight, last time these two guys player together`\The Lakers were outscored by 44 when Kobe was on the floor. Shelvin Mack was +49, meaning the Jazz outscored LA by 49 with Mack on the floor.`\Fun game `\May he rested in pieces`\Thanks fam`\He's averaging less 3PA here than his last season in Minne. Just saying.`\WTF REDDIT COME ON FFS`\CAVS FANS TOLD ME JOE JOHNSON DOESN'T CARE ABOUT WINNING `\kobe and dlo combine for 100?`\It's not that Celtics fans can't handle it, you're just bad at it. `\Let this be a lesson on being lazy and careless for 48 minutes. Congrats to Memphis they put us through the grindhouse. `\Goodbye Ben Simmons my sweet prince`\FWIW, history doesn't affect current odds`\My lighter is about to burn some nugs  to commemorate this league changing rivalry

\#HistoryBeginsToday`\Would you rather Utah or Dallas grab the 8 seed? `\dunno theres been too many victims of cp3 nut lust`\clutcha`\GG Cavs.

Gotta win tomorrow boys.`\Yeah.  Looks awful`\Are these guys going to talk about the game are they going to analyze a tweet for 150 mins`\ http://imgur.com/ZDjjGXr`\Thank you R. Kelly`\Ron...`\BBBBBBBBBBBBBBBB`\Exactly. NBA sucks. `\Still better than the Super Bowl half time show.`\Tf is this rumor about LeBron and Miami?`\Immediately after this, Tony got hit in the wrist so hard that blood was drawn, and yet there wasn't a foul

lmfao`\IM SO HAPPY!! HOPEFULLY WE WIN`\Love on fire... and Kyrie and JR proceed to take all the shots.`\Tell that to Jimmer`\That tank war was real.
Can't wait to see what the young players can do next season!`\He's consistently one of our best players. Great signing. Does all the little things, plays good defense, can get us some buckets too.`\Thank god we're only going up, while Cleveland is only going down`\Who the devil is this Teletonic guy?  We're making him look like Chris Mullin out there.`\big win griz bros`\I know this might be an unpopular opinion with you. But I hate the warriors.
`\Clippers already shipped in the game after half time.  It would make it easier for him to get going.  IIRC Kyrie went 1-8 by halftime or even worse.  That shit won't work in the playoffs.`\MWP knows about passing to kobe`\CURRY FOR D'LO, STRAIGHT UP. WHO SAYS NO???`\I hate the truth you're serving.`\I don't watch the game but by looking at the box score Maybe this is the BEST Defensive game for both team for this season.


4Q - 6 min left - 72 knicks to 71 lakers
`\Holy moly that Huertas/Black alley`\Who needs KLove when you got Frye?`\Clarkson gets hot and is immediately subbed out `\O I was think Julio Jones `\Love looks like a white James Harden today`\so two shitty teams duking it out...yay`\Knicks playing like shit doesn't depend on Kyrie. `\Kyrie not gonna take this`\fuuuucking refs are you kidding me `\Good basketball knowledge you've got going there.`\He has to be extra careful because he has 5 fouls.`\THANK YOU MEMPHIS. THANK YOU VINCE.

`\Last year, the Jeff Teague-Chris Paul matchup would have been pretty even, but now CP3 is completely dominating Teague in pretty much every facet`\Not doing much of that tonight either haha`\Thank you Kobe for putting on a fucking show tonight.`\You really want to be building factories as soon as possible if you want to be a successful Presidente.`\how to fuck is r kelly still in nba???`\TACO TUESDAY IN LA!!!!`\You haven't seen the Pelicans' lineup sans Anthony Davis?`\VC FOR 3!!!!`\*You* lost to us twice.

Ha! Got him!

Edit: I got him so hard he deleted his comments.`\rookies take time to adjust to the nba lol`\damn Salah nearly killed someone on the sideline with that spike`\Lol these refs are retarded`\RUSSELL`\thank you for firing Malone though

really I mean this from the bottom of my heart`\cavs got me feeling like: http://i.imgur.com/A1FaK9Z.jpg`\Vet call. Kobe fucking scared the refs into it lmaooo smh`\OH AND I WILL DOWNVOTE MYSELF SO I CAN UPVOTE IT`\Phoenix owns their pick right? `\Yeah...like you guys are going to win 6 out of your last 8.`\ROY HIBBERT, DANNY GREEN, AND LANCE ALL SHOW UP FOR HEAT GAMES `\Kilpatrick is decent. Reed is garbage.`\Lou being injured meant the young guards got a lot more time, and Huertas has greatly improved over the beginning of the season. A lot more ball movement and creative plays instead of iso's`\I didn't think saying "The LeBron effect" was being a prick, I just thought people could take a joke, which wasn't even directed at a team or fanbase.

I don't really get downvoted that much ever, but in the past day it's been bad because you can't make a joke around Boston fans`\Pretty much. A great win tho. We might not get the draft pick, but at least we have a great core of young players full of great potential.`\ESPN is happy to provide hot takes both on Love and Griffin lol`\Who else you gonna draft? Dunn would just increase our shooting woes.`\Rozier throwing up more bricks...`\Clarkson just playing like absolute shit tonigth`\No. He has shit fucking rotations`\Please use this song for it with some uncle drew sound bites.

"Don't reach, young blood" *clank*

*Another miss* "That's my uncle!"`\Nasty-side!`\Nance playing good D on Melo`\HELL YES MEMPHIS`\Suns have 2 of their best players injured and they're still better than the Lakers. `\[me right now](http://i.imgur.com/9T1kgIr.gif) `\the worst part about garbage time is that i have to watch this disgusting excuse for a human being tyler zeller struggle at every facet of the game.  theres no one ive ever resented more than this human embodiment of a trash can`\JC needs to get his shit together`\Holy shit Jordan`\Grizz pls win`\Thank you ATL. `\We will be the NBA's first ever joint championship`\dude's gonna be a beast fosho regardless of this bad season`\This is such a great gif. Wowee.`\Easy. They're playing way above expectations as it is.`\2spoopy4me`\Clean charge.`\True. I've just never understood complaining about a teams' announcers. They're for that teams fans.`\thanks fam `\No he said Julius Randle did`\uh wtf`\yes`\Mirza Teletovic is a dead eyed KILLER.`\i never thought about him becoming a true impact player in the future (though he has almost singlehandedly won playoff games already), but he does have plenty room for improvement.  he just has a knack for getting shit on--people were calling his rookie year the worst ever when it was nowhere near that bad.  i dont think he deserves all the minutes he gets right now tho, but he just lit us up so i have no room to talk`\DON JULIO "BIG BALLS" RANDLE`\There he is!`\How horrendous was he ������������`\oh my god louis`\Wow you guys must be unbeaten against us on the season, you're clearly much better`\4 commentators is amazing especially with Eagle and Fratello

This could be the greatest (commentated) game ever`\Bass pick and POP!?`\For sure man, he is a monster. But he really needs to keep his emotions in check, he could've got a tech after that shove on Love. I think that was sort of a wake-up call for him cause he seemed to chill out a bit after that. `\Hopefully the home stretch this season will be like last year, where the exact same thing started happening. The Celtics series was a coming out party, until of course his arm came out of its socket.`\I'm convinced that Love just can't play back to backs`\Guys pls.`\So I guess 3rd quarter is ref-ball time `\There's nothing like the taste of Boston tears as they cry about refs. `\Normally I'd prefer if that was a non-call. `\Back to back threesssss J and Joe!!!!`\I mean that was a lot of contact with his arm on love's hip`\"Professional" basketball`\down 2 at the half

leading by 21 in the 4th

fun`\if Russell videoed everything dumb Whiteside says...`\We need the Kyrie Irving stopper Norris Cole.`\Now Huertas, I can get into.`\I feel like the Lakers will blow this because I'm rooting for them and it's throwing things off`\why is that sad? jazz are a young team and they are fighting each game to make the playoffs. who knows if the wolves will make it next year?`\Huertas has been responsible for so much more that 5 buckets`\tony allen murdering cavs singlehandedly`\probably because they've been getting paid more for all the extra work they're doing this season`\Love did a solid for his bro Thompson at least and got him a nice contract too.`\So, uh, are Broussard and Lue related? Dudes could pass as brothers`\I ain't even mad`\I mean he did almost single handedly carry the Cavs in the finals last year.

Edit: I'm not saying he *will*. I just wouldn't call the idea *ridiculous* with playoff LeBron in a somewhat weak Eastern conference. `\Our fans at the arena are dead right now like this thread`\Every other game isn't really deserving of that kind of money.  No one making his salary should ever put up 2/2/2. This good game doesn't change that.  `\The Cavs best and most versatile lineup I think is basically what they ran in the finals last year but with Irving instead of Delly. Irving can be an average or above defender when he wants to, and Shump is a good defender and JR is quite an underrated defender these days. Lebron at the 4 gives them the flexibility and TT is a good rim protector who can also switch on to smalls and roll to the rim.`\duckchat is awful right now, jesus`\ooooh that move`\#THANK YOU NEW YORK CITY, BOTH TEAMS DID GOOD TONIGHT!!!!!!!

Also Lomabrdi's in NY has the best pizza in the world!`\"Fuck Tidal."-Kris Humphries.`\Hope we can finally jettison our vets this off-season. We're not a five seed next year, despite the delusions of some fans. `\no thanks to your young "core" which is all that really matters in these games`\Good win but wow, KLove can be so frustrating to watch sometimes. `\I saw him hit a couple of threes so that's a plus`\not this year we won't even make the playoffs. But enjoy being ringless for another year.`\love it though. how weird would it be without it. `\Forgetting Sarah Marshall or Wizards Basketball?`\It's a careless elbow to the head and neck area.  That's a flagrant every time.`\that's adorable, til`\I weirdly miss those days...no expectations`\GG fam`\Love is in some deeper shit than a "cold streak". `\I'm definitely not ready for this rivalry to come to an end tonight.`\Whiteside can block anything lol.`\Lebron "Dikembe Mutombo" James`\Debates require some sort of proof and a book that has been rewritten a dozen times doesnt count. We can look back at LBJ games as proof, JC has none.`\This was a moral loss for the Suns.`\I assume you mean Boozer couldn't handle the length of the Lakers front court with Pau and Bynum, because you make it seem like Boozer didn't succeed because of Kobe who was guarded by AK47 I presume`\what are you some sort of pirate? `\This team gets carried offensively by Robin Lopez a pretty pathetic amount of the time`\I swear to god Miles Plumlee is immune to getting dunked on.

Just when I though its about time for him to get yammed on because of how much he contests dunks, LeBron missed.`\Lakers kids all make really great passes `\Once he tones down the cockiness some, (which will come with age, at least I *think/hope* it will), dude will be unstoppable. Crazy talented.`\Good for Doug making that three pointer`\This game is amazing, I don't care who wins.`\Play Nick Young please I can't take anymore of Metta`\lakers really need to get a defensive player in the offseason.`\Questions for Magic fans.  With Fournier is a free agent this offseason, do you want him back?  Do you feel he has the ability to a quality NBA starter? I know close to nothing about him but I imagine the Nets are looking to bolster our backcourt this offseason. `\you can hear them happy with Lebron near airballing an iso 3 then Jrich hitting back to back 3's`\I actually really like the wolves and think they have a ton of potential moving forward. Should be a fun game. `\Lebron is about to go nuts. Just wait.`\Cleveland: Would you like this W?

Dallas: No thank you.`\He'd be great in the Turner role. `\Draymond Curry PNR still more dangerous.`\Julio coast to coast. S/o to Roy too, good post D`\Got to see more Bass pick and pops`\Parsons should've attempted to thread the needle to Dirk, better than that shit show of a posession.`\If you get paid millions of dollars to play a game, an elbow to the neck shouldn't hurt. /s`\I am conditioned to get overly excited whenever Tony hits any shot.  This is weird.`\Why are you linking some dude's face?`\for fuck sake I need beal to score 3 points, JUST 3, to win my fantasy playoffs matchup.

0/3 you're killin me bro`\DeAndre Jordan would be more funny`\Heurtas actually having a decent game`\LeBron is travelling big time today`\HAH.  Epic side eye from Ryan towards Jarell.  At least that is how I am choosing to interpret it.  Probably mad because Jarell's better.`\you spelled ref wrong.`\Bullshit that was a normal motion

I do that shit all the time when i need extra hmmph behind my shot `\Laker fans so entitled that even when they're losing, they feel like they have to win at it`\Sorry I was asleep fuck these late games `\Hell of a first game, congrats buddy.

That said, go Clippers.`\Offense needs to get going if we want to have a chance of winning.`\LOOL did anyone see that cavs ad? holy fuck lmao`\Eventually you'd think our luck would turn around and these soul-crushing losses would stop, but again and again and again we have our hearts broken. We just have this way of snatching defeat from the jaws of victory in the most spectacular way possible. `\Im not sure that's true. I would argue they would be right where they currently are, and that is playing each other in the first round for the right to lose to the Warriors in 4, 5 or 6 games.


Sure they would have a better shot with BG or Gasol, and would be more talented. But would it really change much in the scheme of things?`\#Those filthy casuals`\"Mo is playing Plinko with the rim!"

`\Principle 9

Show Appreciation `\*What*`\Larry Nance such a beast lol`\Are you not entertained?`\Shump 5x5 watch?`\well our motto is "We don't need to play defense if we score more points"

But do u remember when we had a top 10 defense at the beginning of the year? `\VC slapped the shit out of him. `\FUCK

COME ON, HATEFUL EIGHT`\I'm afraid we're fucked regardless but I want to win it all more than anything (anything trivial I suppose, like I'd end hunger first I guess).`\For some reason I thought he was already retired.`\I'm being realistic. All TT has to do is body him up. They both have about the same amount of post skills.`\In a season where coaches get fired left and right, he has to make lineups out of nothing. I'd looked stressed too in his shoes. Major props to him this season`\To steal Ben Simmons from u bb`\Kobe "Kobe 'Black Mamba' Bryant" Bryant`\http://i.imgur.com/iJDMOH8.jpg`\the tracks have come off the tank`\TONY ALLEEEEEEN IS FUCKING GOING CRAZY AS SHIT RIGHT NOW`\I know Lance isn't worth his 9M option but I still think we definitely try to keep him one way or another. `\Yeah those great Nets, also called the Lebron stoppers am I right `\just as long as they find a reliable wing shooter so they don't get knocked out in the elite eight by WVU`\beat them so bad you took away ten of their wins?`\Sounds like I didn't miss much by not seeing the first half. `\Huertas, JC and Russell can all handle the ball, as can Randle and if we end up with Simmons, so can he

We're pretty good there. Gotta keep Huertas though`\Bruised shin.`\travel on`\I think the game I watched Heat/Warriors your guy's announcers killed it. `\That's a few nouns away from a Spartacus line`\No worries, we have something special cooked up for this year's rematch: the SVG-inspired "Form a Fucking Wall" offense. The other four players all set one giant super-screen, and Steph shoots from behind it. He'll never miss.`\Bscott showing you suns scrubs how to tank properly `\Blasphemous

There is only one Peoples Champ`\Seems like a strange stat to focus on, considering he had 28/7 on good shooting %`\i agree, in 6 years they will become a competitive basketball team`\Season high in assists, a LeBron triple double, and clinching the central division. What a night.`\LeBron at the 4 may also be a solid idea it turns out.`\of course pierce gets injured right when he starts balling out`\Youre going out of your way to watch it right now tho`\Needs some stickum.`\So...  Knicks fans...  We really suck, man.`\U gotta make a scapegoat to hate when you're a bandwagon`\yes`\No kidding. I love JAM!`\i mean like what else did he say

or was that it`\Those lobs could be to TT one day ... young Cav.

Jk maybe tho `\Ingram's a good shooter from all over the court and probably won't require the ball in his hands to be effective. If I remember correctly, he also has great length/size for his position

Simmons is the best NCAAA player this year, but he excels as the primary ball-handler. He's also got no jump-shot so the speak. There's also some question about whether he's a SF or PF in the NBA as well I think.`\##Expected Starters

Monty McCutchen

Nick Buchert

Lauren Holtkamp`\do people actually believe this shit?`\Subjective "worth" =/= only determinant of contract.`\It's getting to the point where we shouldn't consider trading him anymore. Brook has been with us for 8 seasons, no matter the trade talk or the shitty seasons, he has wanted to stay with the Nets. Granted, it was most likely his best choice financially, but it should be rewarded. `\This is true. `\Also Jerry Sloan's birthday`\It's irritating how much the cavs commenator laughs.`\Jeff Green shut down Thad.  Every time he wasn't on him Thad to it to the rim.`\Hibbert ruins any offensive sets and he is to slow on D Byron basically gave up when he sub'd him in .`\The Clippers are being deep fried tonight`\He has elite parts to his defence if nothing else. Kevin doesn't have any of that.`\KABOOM`\old people smh.... /s`\You have JR Smith on your team. `\The middle-ground would be a regular foul, and it seems that folks would probably accept that. `\Ugh Sullinger, that was ugly.  `\Play on the ball my man, you only need 1 replay to see it`\kyle korver?`\Lakers pls I live in L.A give me hope `\Shaq? `\Argh, why am I being downvoted for offering a genuine opinion?

I just think one of your big 3's needs to play a semblance of defense. But, is my comparison off by calling him Kevin Martin 2.0? (Not because he's light-skinned)`\Lol these refs. PJ tries to take the charge as Lebron gets mauled. Refs call it out of bounds. `\Jesus how do you let LeBron have that much time I mean he's been bad at 3s this season but come on`\5 years and the max. `\Hope Pierce comes back, crowd is quiet `\D'Lo gnna get hot just watch`\I feel you my elderly neighbor. I drank a cup of coffee right before the game to keep me awake.`\but Embiid looking Thick and Big doesnt attract you?`\ Lol the ass hurt is real

Edit: "ass shirt" are you  high autocorrect?
`\Playoff Cavs right here`\This has showed me how important Chalmers was to our team. He made the team actually run plays. Now they are just doing iso after iso. But honestly what can you do? Half the team is new, and no one knows how to run the point. Similar thing happened with the Cavs when Chalmers needed a breather. `\Dlo is such a complete player Offensively. `\http://imgur.com/MUD3yNx`\Only time ill be rooting for the clippers.`\Ill like to see us put Frye at the 5 when Whiteside is out there. Makes him useless on the defensive end and he isn't good enough to abuse Frye on the defensive end. `\Dave Joerger looks rough--major raccoon eyes.  `\I really don't get how he's still in the NBA`\they're garbage, switch to celts stream and listen to the white mamba`\I like listening to comedian's podcast during things like games cause you don't really have to pay attention. Im currently listening to Bill Burr. I really like Joey Diaz's too`\HE'S ON FIRE`\Matt Barnes, perhaps?`\As a previous USC grad living in vegas, I'll take your word for it,`\Hahaha "That's just a young official that has a Kobe poster in his house" -Hastings.`\For real never seen a rookie get hated on that bad before.`\Holy shit tony. What the fuck?`\Doesn't matter got bounds.`\Was your beer Natty light?`\You're prime is 3 years in. Kevin love and kyrie are both in it. `\This game has 0 historical significance because it is likely not the last time that LeBron and Huertas face off.`\Feed Kobe the ball youngins. It's his night.`\yeah bruised knee, out for precautionary reasons`\Isn't about time we steal Orlando's big man?`\Shump has been a beast on the boards`\Lmao Nick Young isn't on the bench. Probably at home packing his bags for cheating on Iggy`\http://i.imgur.com/1F4QL1x.gif`\mozgov would have dropped that one JR`\Kobe's giving everything into this game, I love it.
`\Dude...you should feel embarrassed for posting that`\Clarkson really harassing the grizzlies with his defense at the end. `\Lebron dug deep for that shoulder slumping and teammate glaring performance. Kyrie was getting sasha pavlovic level stare downs.`\The problem is he always stands at the corner threes. I wish he just set up camp in the post. `\LeCurry to the front page.`\wow seriously?  No foul there?`\I can't wait until Kelly comes back so I don't have to watch Zeller anymore `\Russell got nailed with the ticky tack calls early smh`\Deangelo is the real deal, faaak`\Anyone else see LeBron try to flop there?`\HA!`\Imagine the shitstorm here if they were faking all the drama all year round, and had secretly been practicing their ass off and getting really close as a team, adn then just fuck their way through the playoffs like a hot knife through butter.`\Boston is killer in the second night of back2backs`\Is this the team that's supposed to beat the Warriors in June?`\METTA WORLD PEACE.`\Holy shit put the starters in`\Reminding you all to grind forth`\Imo, this kind of stuff makes him more likable.

It's just people who hate him find ways to hate him more.`\Dlo just oozes swag...`\/u/SaltyVLC always has a great selection`\Managed to cop these for $55!`\Appreciate it bro.`\Not always...`\Well at least the bench cares��`\They didn't play like they wanted to be playing though. They don't deserve to be out there in this one.`\Delly managed to foul him without touching him`\I honestly had no idea MWP still played `\Shiiit hope thats not a concussion.`\I feel like Tyson Chandler being out the second half really helped us to win the game.`\Orlando cannot guard the perimeter this quarter. Extra passing the Magic to death`\No one knows who or why there was a tech being shot`\It's funny how people say playoffs LeBron is going to lead the cavs to the finals as if these problems are magically going to disappear `\REFBALL!`\Fuck reddit

Good job Phx`\We're matching Fournier no matter what. I hope we get Parsons as well. Fournier off the bench playing the 2/point would be ideal `\I've never seen so much controversy for a properly timed game thread before lol`\RJ looked rejuvenated lately`\we got this`\They're not, really.  On pace for 60 wins still.  Many years have occured without a 60-win team.

People just see the Spurs and Warriors and expect the Cavs to also be on this historically-good level, and they aren't.
`\DAE tank`\God, I love me some Schroder.`\Thanks for explaining that. Didn't know.`\Disney please buy TNT so Ernie and the gang can take over.`\It seems like the Cavs are always home lol`\It's OK. It's just how you worded it came off as really off putting, and he does this shit for free so it's like, why hate?`\good shit otto`\You got this Lakers`\It's crazy that everyone is like "sweet great game from Lebron THIS IS PLAYOFF LEBRON" and he pretty much only matched his career averages. The dude is a monster `\well at least Memphis has Jordan to carry them `\We are probably going to lose, but this new play from the Lakers is both exciting and scary. We are showing flashes of the future and our potential, but I am scared that we will be good enough to overtake Phoenix. `\Kyrie cooking rivers right now `\JR 6/9 from the field. Pipe has been laid`\Chalmers trying to get fancy. `\I made the comparison last game. Randle is your Len. `\Happy we won by 4 so Paul George's shot clock violation wouldn't be an excuse`\spamming that spin move`\Livid? Don't exaggerate. They never even explicitly said that it was a bad call, let alone were they *livid.*`\It almost happened in 2009.`\Archie with 0 minutes.

Watson really wants to win.`\Gonna be real nice when D-Lo develops that post up game a little more.`\Is that Carlos boozer or a cholo hype man for the Lakers? `\Jamal is fools gold. For every game hell shoot you into the game hell shoot you out of the same amount `\No dont say that... The warriors will blow you out and sweep you , the spurs will prolly sweep you too but it'll be a series of heart breaking games with losses by 5 or less`\Luigi Chambles is my lord and savior.`\Clippers need a ball handler for the second unit`\I'm proud of TT for actually going straight back up with a rebound instead of trying to dribble`\LELBRON SEASON APPROACHIN `\yess cmon grizz`\Payton's making shots...feels like Rubio against us in the first game of the season w/ a defensive passing PG who can't shoot well making Js against us`\No thanks to Parsons, but I think a big reason we cleared so much space had to do with re-signing Fournier. Dude should be a part of our future core.`\Rotation was so good`\I mean, if we had to rank all of the coaches, he'd be in the bottom five, no doubt in my mind,`\there were runs both ways, Clippers managed to get it to 12 points with 4 minutes to go in the 3rd. Not impossible to get a win from that, if they could have kept a run going.`\YEAH BABY`\I'm glad someone pointed it out that doesn't have a cavs flair because we would be destroyed for saying that. That being said we turned the ball over a million times and kind of deserved this.`\Bright spot`\And the clips face us next. ouch`\lebron w/o his headband looks weird`\Thrill too based btw

I kind of wanted to pick him up this year if he hadn't gotten injured. He would fill a role for the Blazers for sure, plus be great for practices.`\Do we want the 7th seed though?`\Jeff Ayres unleashing the Aryan Nation in garbage time`\Unreal.`\Well yeah I agree with you but it's not as if it's rare, they are in the top ten teams in the league in 3 point percentage and very close to the top 3`\LOL Nance `\Yes`\I can't wait til Kevin Love is traded this summer. He looks so washed up and awful `\now that you mention that game its funny to hear all of you guys complain about calls when the only reason you won is because of a terrible call lol.`\This is why the injury was especially individually unfortunate -- it restricted the sample size on his 3 ball (Though technically he hit 43% on the year), and it also kept people from seeing what we were doing with him on offense which was incredibly cool.  At point we ran him as the effective Center in a 4-out set, and then ran him as the roll man in the PnR to take advantage of his speed and leaping ability and mitigate the impact of his shooting.

Edit:

Also, the things he's especially good at on defense are things that necessitate the new era ball movement countering switch-heavy systems, and for the opposing team to want to space the floor, so as to emphasize his excellent recovery-as-help skills and nose for tracking down rebounds that ricochet into space.

Basically, I think that despite being unable to shoot, he's still well-equipped for the current age.  Much better than, say, Gerald Henderson.`\This 1st quarter has been pure Celtics porn. `\its a prank bro`\You seriously can't deny playoff lebron is another man can you?`\8 players active, only one of which was a starter. I don't know what happened but I like it.`\Ahhh DLo shoulda shot it as soon as Brandon got it out to you `\See above. NBA ain't dumb.`\I don't understand Byron's relationship with Lakers rookies.`\Fuck it, blow it up and build around Huertas.`\Tank You Metta `\ref should be happy MWP didn't kill him there.

and WTF Bryon Scott what is that grin?`\Mudiay is averaging 11.1, 3.2, 5.8.

Russell is averaging 12.4, 3.6, 3.4

It really isn't that big of a difference. A big part of the efficiency difference is Malone doesn't pull Mudiay when he is struggling he makes him play through it unlike what happened with Russell throughout the year.  `\You can blame it all on me`\You probably watched at most 6-7 Cleveland games last year.

And based on your postings here, I doubt you even understand what good defense is.

Last year, Kyrie was horrible in defending the pick-n-roll, but outside of that, he was solid. That made him below average, but considerably better than he has been in any other season.

Saying that Kyrie wasn't good in game 1 last year is ridiculous and shows that you didn't even watch it.`\Yeah I'll msg you it `\[Here's a list of some other recent all-time great players at age 31.](http://www.basketball-reference.com/play-index/pcm_finder.cgi?request=1&sum=0&y1=2016&p1=jamesle01&y2=2010&p2=bryanko01&y3=2004&p3=onealsh01&y4=2008&p4=duncati01&y5=2008&p5=garneke01&y6=2010&p6=nowitdi01)

Compare the numbers of those player with their prime numbers. I think that LeBron James is having the best 31-year-old season out of any of those guys. `\Well shit `\I can imagine how frustrating it must be being a suns fan watching knight shoot every time`\he would honestly be a great player for blazers quick shooting offense. unfortunate to see beno getting waived by the het.`\refs quick with that whistle in the 4th. `\I didn't elaborate on the finals because i figured it's a foregone conclusion west wins`\At least there's no more games in LA`\Is it just me or is the second "p" on the Clippers jersey out misaligned? It looks higher than all the other letters`\The result doesn't do justice `\Agreed`\I'm puking with glee!`\uh, Dellavedova?`\OH I mean just the bench mob`\Maybe they didnt show that part of the replay at the game but from what I saw it looked like he did nothing. And that shoulder check to LeBron when he got dropped was LeBron into him and getting dropped `\Our bench didn't party`\lol @ bucks announcers talking about Giannis like he's already the same caliber of player as LeBron`\Mozgov stepped on Love pretty hard.  `\They were probably trying to hide the evidence. `\yall are now in the position where you draft for the BPA who fills a need

Right?`\I want to tell Kobe I'm getting tired of his ass motherfucker. `\Damn that hit to the face looks like it hurt`\In ratio of most fans to haters absolutely. Kobe and bron have both had massive amounts of fans that hate him. No NBA player has been this liked while having so few that dislike him since Jordan. `\Yeah, Turner at the rim is good. I don't think it's unusual for him to be making those.`\Two of them are Not white. `\Should be a lesson to whoever is behind these lineups. Give Mozgov some fucking minutes.`\Keep expectations at rock bottom and you never have to answer for anything`\Um, something is wrong with the blocked category.`\wow this is a very ugly game`\definitely deserved to lose with 25 turnovers lmao.`\You're bullying Kevin love right now. You've become what you hate. `\Heat-Cavs in the ECF and Spurs-Warriors in the WCF. Please, Heat, get the 3 seed, I need this in my life.`\Anticlimactic end to the half there but this game is quite entertaining.`\Mudiay is an order of magnitude worse athlete than Wall. Mudiay is a very good athlete. Wall put up among the best all time measures at the pre-draft workouts.

If everything else about them were the same, Mudiay would still be behind Wall in that. But then, Wall also went #1 overall for other reasons including his superior handle and court vision.

Mudiay's a good player, but he doesn't look much like Wall at all.`\I Love the Lakers!`\If you're a true Celtics fan, the choice is the latter, fuck the Lakers. `\Jesus, make a fucking bucket!`\love needs to learn how to take care of the ball when posting up feels like it is way to easy to take the rock from him.`\Is one player.  Their actual rotation mostly consists of players 25 or younger, with Ish Smith as the oldest at 27.`\nah he had some pretty good offensive seasons in Indiana`\> *shrug* yolo

We could have been the team to break it.`\It's not all that bad honestly. Marcelo can facilitate with the best of them, Young and Brown provide the outside shooting, Tarik down low.

They're playing tougher on both ends. LBJ is the only reason the cavs are not down by 20+.`\Kobe is playing. I am 4 beers deep already a half hour before the game. I got pics with the 1987 trophy. And I got my future son Kobe a legit Kobe jersey fron Staples the last time I will see him play. Already a great day. Let's get a W.`\#BUDDY2BUCKS`\GSW Lost
Spurs Lost
Cavs Lost

Dang`\Marcelo "Steve" Huertas `\the problem was that a mediocre big man could do well in the nba, now in order for a big man to relevant he needs to be very good`\Webber is a dog defensively, and he has a good stroke. Not the strongest shooter, but an amazing facilitator and he has a better shooting stroke than what Jordan Adams showed last summer during Summer League. He'd be a good backup point guard to have.


Having Webber, McCallum, and Adams as our young guard talent to develop would be amazing. If we keep Lance, then we can have a Perimeter Rotation of Conley-Allen-Lance-Webber-Adams-McCallum. That would be a killer mix between Veteran leadership and young shooting talent that can play D. Plus, beyond Next Year, we don't know how TA will look with another season under his belt, so having these guys as prospects that we develop who are ready to step in when it's time for TA to hang them up would be phenomenal for us.


Ideally, I'd like next season's Roster to look like this -

PG: Conley, McCallum, Webber

SG: TA, Adams, (Lance/McCallum)

C: Marc, BWright, [Insert good backup center/prospect]`\People are still going to find a way to complain about Russell not playing in the 4th `\And we really can't afford to mess around since Philly's basically quit the season now (we're almost as many games ahead of them as they have wins). We can't afford to finish better than 2nd. `\Robin Lopez out here looking like an All-NBA center`\exciting af game for a quarter, then we still tank in the end. not bad, Lakers`\That wasn't a hack LeBron got away with, that was a mauling. `\Kings fans; can we talk about Boogie?

I *love* that kid, and think he was snubbed for 2 years re not making the All-star game.

What is your team doing to assist him with his temperament?

Is there a possibility that the Kings could bring in an ex player; a Bibby, Christie, C Webb, Shareef, et al, to help him?

He picked up his 15th tech of the year, and towards the end of the game on his 5th foul I swear Zack Zarba stopped dead in his tracks waiting for an outburst from Boogie to give him his second T.

I think that, and I hate to say this, but his attitude hurts your team because his attitude precedes him, and refs are going to clamp down on him due to his perceived hot headedness, and this may prevent your team from getting crucial calls.

I really really want the Kings to be better than this.

Note: Data from basketball-reference, March 9th. Data from ranges 0-3,3-10,10-16,16-<3pt,3p are plotted to the midpoint of the range. For example, FG% for 0-3 is plotted at 1.5 feet, 3-10 at 6.5, 10-16 at 13, 16-<3pt at 19.875. 3pt% is plotted at 23.75 however. The curves in between ARE NOT to be used to extrapolate data accurately, it merely shows the *trend* between separate points, as the area under the curves divided by a unit length will not provide the FG% for the range as an average value.`\X rays negative for d'angelo.

But Ryan Kelly scored on you`\huertgod`\good company for RCR - last time a team had 3 players with 23+ points all under the age of 23: OKC Durant/Westbrook/Harden`\I love how the response to the overreaction in that thread is to overreact in this thread. Never change, /r/nba. Even though the Cavs don't give a shit about how bad TT's contract is, it doesn't change the reality that it's a bad contract. From a strictly ability to salary ratio point of view, he's massively overpaid in the current cap and still overpaid in the future cap. Again, the Cavs don't care, but the people acting like it's a good contract now are being ridiculous. `\This doesn't mean anything and no one will will notice but I was the first person to predict Memphis would win in last night's game thread when Cleveland and Memphis fans alike had all but written Memphis off. :)`\Yeh sure if they aren't in their prime I guess durant and steph aren't either.

He's a role player. The best players accept their role when playing with a true superstar. D.Wade and Bosh averaged 16.1 ppg/5apg and 13.4/7rpg  over the playoffs in the year the Heat beat the Spurs. You look at those numbers without a name and you think role players. You put them on their own teams as #1 options and those guys are superstars, but there isn't room in a modern NBA team for 3 superstars.

Acknowledging this and understanding that Klove is a defensive liability both when defending ball handlers on switches and roll men on PNR's, and also understanding that nearly every NBA offense devolves into ISO and PNR plays in the 4th quarter, it makes complete and utter sense for Klove not to be playing when his offense will not outweigh his defense which happens at the end of games.

Blatt understood this and last year Klove sat the bench at the end of games. We went small ball with TT/LBJ as our front court. After re-signing K-love, I believe there was pressure from the FO to get Blatt to make sure Love was fitting in. Love hasn't been sitting on the bench at the end of games this year and this has been the first time IIRC, he has sat since Lue took over.

NOT A GOOD SIGN WHEN YOU LITERALLY HAVE NO POINT GUARDS LEFT ON THE ROSTER BARRY.

It was 64-61 Boston when Chalmers went down...`\Yes`\Because what is the alternative? The bench offensive sets that game mostly involved passing around the perimeter and either taking a long jumper or giving the ball to Jamal in hopes of bailing them out. They couldn't get any penetration.`\irving kills us everytime`\God damn I love Delly`\Wtf was that Melo`\Guard the damn three point line, get JC going and we got this shit.`\Yeah, that's it!

Still having trouble figuring out the last one (though you can see she's got her hands ready to pull off the straps on the pink dress), but she makes a small mistake when she puts on the blue dress after the green one and you can see her pull it down over the green one. I imagine they just found unique ways to disguise really really fast clothing changes, but damn that's crazy. `\How the fuck

I hope the lack of applause was just an audio thing too...cuz thatd suck`\oladipo is an all star`\When I watch Lebron dunk like that, I feel like I could go and do the same.  I cannot.`\Only cavs fans would go on another teams subreddit and mass downvote everyone lol`\Bass just running out there getting easy buckets`\It takes time to build that chemistry.  Looking good now and set up nicely for next year especially with your draft pick.`\Ariza and Gasol are still around `\He was pissed because he was calling for timeout, not for a foul.

`\OH MY GOD BEAL IS STILL IN IM SO FUCKING DONE `\Well at least they didn't lose one they deserved to win, I guess`\no, I understand the hate for tommy. personally I love him but I'm a homer just like he is. but it's annoying when every single game thread has the same exact comment about our announcers sucking. what's really annoying is people saying the announcers suck when we're on the road.. Tommy doesn't even commentate road games. unless you hate gorman, which makes no sense cause he's awesome`\Celtics never complain ever, Lord President Stevens would never allow that.`\we have talent, but no identity or cohesion.

And it's a stretch to say Love had a good game, 2-9 from the field is bad. Even if he had a double double. `\Kobe no equals machine's legacy, machine is sexy`\I understand wanting to keep your pick but this thread has WAY too much wanting the team you root for to lose.`\We're 6th this year in FT %, strange night.`\He wasn't trashing him at all`\Holy shit Marcus is getting called for breathing the wrong way `\Don't let them beat us by 20.`\Lots of teams already do that`\Said the same thing.`\THAT ADJUSTMENT WITH THE LEFT HAND. HOW. `\This is a great OT.`\Yup. Just wait for Lebron to shoot 41.7% from the field and 22.7% from three.`\Well, I leave for like 10ish minutes and we play amazing.`\That's a good point, I always figured dribbling skills was something you're already great at coming into the league or not so much with little room for improvement.`\I had to search too far to find this comment. You guys are slipping.`\I did, but at least the Bulls are decent. He played like that against a not good Nets team`\Motherfucking Zack Randolph`\I just don't get how someone can stop watching during the down seasons.  I've been to ring night and this night has been better already.`\This is his last season; he came back because he wants to help coach. He may end up being our development coach which would be awesome. `\Kinda reminds me of a longer Gerald Wallace`\we steph now!`\Ryan Kelly is a stretch-4 who shoots 15% from 3. `\Dude come on it's the last Kobe/LeBron matchup, wouldn't be one of these without Lakers fans shitposting`\Doc picking his nose and scratching at his armpit while he says "our bench has been good since December"

At this point you can't catch the Sixers, and none of the Wolves, Suns, or Nets can really catch you.`\Still a w for the entertainment`\Shooting. And the length. Ben Simmons is a rebounding and passing machine, kind of like James without the shooting touch. Ingram is more like durant in that he can spot up and shoot over defenders. Ingram is a better pick for the lakers because he can pick his spots, while Ben Simmons might take away the ball handling times between Clarkson and Russell.

You can compare Simmons with Randle, since they have a similar game, but Simmons has a great passing vision and the touch while Randle is more of a bully in the paint.`\This is what happens when we don't have Lou jacking up 15 shots per game to get fouls and go to the free throw line. Also, because of Lou, Huertas was deep in the bench with limited playing time. The only time he got to show off was for the Shaqtin' O Fool.

EDIT: Glad to see Huertas doing well. If we have this team (except without Lou, Ryan Kelly and possibly Hibbert) and the draft pick (Simmons or Ingram), then we will do well next season.`\hey fuck you too, but thx bb`\Please stay healthy Kyrie PLEASE basketball deserves a healthy rematch.`\You get a steal, you get a steal, everybody gets a steal!`\And the big 3 had a good game (on paper).`\Miami making that climb for 3rd seed, damnnnn.

Kyrie tugged him backwards.`\Looks like he brought a spoon when he needed a bucket loader. `\Lol people said the same last year and yet the Cavs went 12-2 in the East...`\"And you lost to us twice. That makes you worse then the Grizz by your logic."`\Try being a Sixers fan maybe you'll appreciate your team more.`\I think it might've been a certain someone you hated`\I thought the whole Kobe/LeBron storyline felt really forced going into the game but I'm enjoying being proved wrong `\bron pls`\Either a PG or a C with our early 2nd round pick would be a good move.`\salt salt salt salt salt`\Then you are blind and naive.`\This is the most airballs I've seen in a half`\Really he just plays a hard fast style. Constantly driving the ball trying to get some inside scoring which is his bread and butter. He has a decent shot but I'm sure he trusts in his finishing ability more than the jumper. If he doesn't have the open lane he kicks it out or tries to hit gortat close to the basket when driving and it'll get picked off because everyone's positioning is off. He's at his best when he can run a fast paced style up and down the floor thanks to his agility `\Honestly, LeBron is not a very good ball handler he isn't comfortable going off the dribble unless he has a decent angle to the rim. That's why he sometimes dribbles the ball so long around the perimeter because he is waiting for an open lane. `\phrasing`\Gonna be 3 this Thursday `\Pass the ball Kyrie`\Third quarter curse is back boys`\No, they're known to be biased towards the Cavs. Not sure why everyone complains all the time. They're Cleveland home announcers and want they're team to do well...`\Where's the gif?`\Thanks wiz fans! WE IN THE FINALS NOW`\Lou = deep cover Peja `\You're my dude.  I was at the game today and for some reason that makes your hype twice as satisfying as usual :)`\That doesn't seem right to me. The Cavs are monsters on the board. TT/Love/LeBron/Shumpert are all probably above-average rebounders for their positions.

I think the key to beating the Cavs is PG play and a 4 that can force Love into a lot of actions on defense. `\Come on Russ `\We're not salty, this dude just tries to shit on russell in every thread about him and it's gotten old.`\.....jesus christ `\Well he's got 5 fouls and the 4th quarter hasn't started, so that's not that hard to believe.  `\da cxavs`\Lakers beat the Warriors. Brooklyn beats the Cavs. What is the world coming to`\Y'all play hard but still take L's. If we meet you're getting swept again. ISO ball just dropped 120 on your asses, just wait til Lebron is actually trying.`\Wow Mirza trying inside job this one`\Clarkson can't iso. Ugh`\WHAT A GAME`\Hopefully that is the start of a good streak for him. Love starting to play well would be such a huge boost to this team. `\I was there (Lakers & Clippers fan, as I've explained a billion times on this sub) and it was amazing. Easily in the top 5 most fun nights of my life.`\He has been amazing for us. With Gallo out, he's exactly the scorer we need.`\Feel like I'm watching a Celtics game with these green jerseys. `\Refs just going to let them beat the crap outta each other`\Fire T.Lue`\What the HELL`\Love ESPN's reporting here. Basically "no one we spoke to thinks it's a big deal, but we're going to debate it on national tv instead of calling the game, as if it were a big deal."`\still too early?

Gotta get there first.`\Channing frye looks like a different guy today`\Celtics are great, wow`\We have 27 points right now...`\christ`\His game has always been like this, but now the left box post-up babyhooks aren't falling.

It's the same shit for every single player across the nba. `\Celtics are a fun team but this is why people don't take them seriously in the east. They got sweeped by the cavs last year and I don't see them winning a series against either cavs or Raps this year`\Need that referee help too?

Hopefully after a few times hanging out with her I’ll ask her to be my girlfriend. Assuming she says yes, I’d save up to buy a house and ask her to move in with me. I’m going to plan a special dinner with her and then look right into those beautiful irises, and say those magical four words: “Will you marry me?” She’ll say “Yes” with tears swelling in her eyes. All of this, just to let D’Angelo fuck my bitch.

We're not contenders this year but you guys are yet you will never win a series against GS or SA, Lebron will get older and eventually your team will fall back into mediocrity where it belongs.`\Man, I used to think Kobes farewell tour was really cheesy, but watching this game, something clicked in me. Im really gonna miss Kobe and its gonna feel so weird without him.`\i've seen this mentioned on enough magic threads that i'm afraid to`\This no tank basketball is pretty fun! `\God our D with this lineup is awful, no excuse to ever give up this many points to this team `\Question Do La residents get both Lakers and Clippers games on TV? `\Does anyone have a stream?`\http://imgur.com/Apw3f4O`\Yeah that's good to see.

Note: Data from basketball-reference, March 16th. Data from ranges 0-3,3-10,10-16,16-&lt;3pt,3p are plotted to the midpoint of the range. For example, FG% for 0-3 is plotted at 1.5 feet, 3-10 at 6.5, 10-16 at 13, 16-&lt;3pt at 19.875. 3pt% is plotted at 23.75 however. The curves in between ARE NOT to be used to extrapolate data accurately, it merely shows the *trend* between separate points, as the area under the curves divided by a unit length will not provide the FG% for the range as an average value.`\We already knew that though`\48 point loss ties the worst loss in Lakers franchise history`\hey Kobe you sure you want retire?`\His body is tore up`\I jumbled up bright spot and upside lol `\Even though I'm not a fan, Crawford has been good for the Clippers this year. Austin sucks.`\YOU ARE THE FUTURE RUSSELL`\Best backcourt in the league ;)`\maybe after this game people will stop saying the clippers should trade blake`\TA looks so refreshed right now after being out for a bit. `\I wonder what the 6 arms guy does for a living`\:)`\why blame on Spo, they want shoot at last second in clock and we all know it's gonna be wade`\this shit is fire `\Nance looks like a generated player from 2k`\Dirty deeds, done dirt...well not cheap. But absolutely worth it for the Cavs. `\oladipo > steph curry`\Heat win and Kyrie still scores 30+ ?

Who says no`\Mudiay is just awful`\Even when Kelly tries hard to win, he fucks it up somehow. `\Austin Rivers is "Create a Player"`\LeBron with the "I don't wanna mess up my FG%" pass at the end of the first half`\I LOVE LANCE`\please bench  Len`\Can't blame you, the 4 hours of sleep I got last night because of the game isn't treating me too well so far today lol`\Kobe will probably go off on us again. Instead of a double overtime like against the Wolves, Wiz lose by 31. Wall goes 3-19 and hits 10 turnovers. Beal gets hurt as a result of playing too many minutes. Otto has another Shaqtin' play that is destined to earn him another MVP. Oubre doesn't play and gets hit in the nose by the ball on the bench, leaving him ugly forever.

Just some thoughts.`\TANK-OFF 2016 WHO CAN TANK THE HARDEST!

They're all versus current playoff teams including @Cleveland and GSW twice.   They also face Portland twice in that stretch which could end up having big seeding implications.  `\Man, let this game end`\Not in the west`\20 pts 15 reb 130yrds 2 tds and 2RBIs`\There's a dude here that follows the lakers, Dodgers, packers, Ucla basketball, and USC football.

It's kinda like supporting the Lakers to beat the Nets this year. Fuck the Lakers but not at the cost of the Celtics`\Ryno is also injured. Fuck everything! How are we not getting blown out?!`\LOL Of course D Will would score that.`\Fadeaway means you're falling away from the basket.  JR hit this falling to the side 3PTer that shouldn't fall but for some reason JR can never miss on.  `\Zbo is love, Zbo is life`\Calm down Lakers fans, there is no way  the Suns will lose. `\Grit and fucking grind `\Yeah, I always saw Kobe as being a way different person. This season showed me how grounded and intelligent he really is, or can be at times. `\My tv must be fucked up...the TWC channel is just showing me a dumpster on fire`\but we curbstomped them in SA and won in Brooklyn`\that was fucking good. but hell I didn't think Randle was the go to there`\Yeah, but he's not a 7'3 PG...`\Lebron is so much cooler than the rest of the guys on the floor not named Kobe`\Dude. Dude, no. On r/NFL your a fellow Patriot but over here.. Not the Lakers. Anyone but them.

Also, we talking current LeBron? Current then I'm taking Curry. `\technically yes`\We've descended back to pre-All Star Break incompetency. This is tough to watch.`\Morris is playing really well tonight.`\I am quite nervous about Huertas guarding Kyrie

Edit: nm Delly is in`\We'll probably never know`\Dat boy sick doe`\More importantly, we need a gif of Thompson's reaction to the Shumpert dunk`\Definitely was a travel`\Wiz I still love/hate you. So fuck you, but I'm excited to watch you or whatever.
`\I LOVE YOU KIEFF`\Damn, you guys really have some recency bias. Amare on offense in Dallas was an absolute BEAST last year.`\That gif of squidward saying "future" is basically how I feel about the Lakers.`\fuck everything about that entire game. this team needs to get it together

just no effort`\DLO went off!! goddamn, that was nice`\This team really shows up for the big games. Can't wait for the playoffs. Hopefully we can get the 5th seed, otherwise we will see a really close series, but a first round exit again`\Anyone know why Kobe didn't start the second half? Is he done for the night become of his shoulder?`\nah we're good.`\And 1 ? `\That was a damn flop he had position on the box out and he just jumped and fell.`\was it ever on?`\You should be terrified as well. Your GM has a terrible record of drafting busts and hes going to have a top 5 pick to screw up this year. Winslow and Josh Richardson both better than any pick the celtics made last year and the year before.`\Laker up son`\Yeah I need to know what he's responding to there..`\We won the last 3/5 and in this game DLO, Clarkson, and Randle had at least 20 pts.

Only dead inside.`\da rooks playing like da rooks :(`\Stop showing Cam and stop talking about Cam's hat. No one gives a fuck.`\Well he was restraining himself better when we were in the playoff hunt. But, he knows there's no chance of playoffs now so it seems like he stopped trying to avoid getting T's.`\I think its hilarious when analysts try and speculate what's going on in the head of athletes off the court. `\Who replaced Tony Allen with an offensive android?`\Fuck me I love this game`\D'lo was unanimous if i recall correctly`\Mozgov and smith you filthy casual`\Just have fun. The season doesn't matter really as long and the warriors are around. We have had the weirdest season ever and its a blast. `\it was around this time last night that portland let the 76ers back in the game`\Kelly the GOAT of tanking`\Pretty bad. Would love to see them deal him somewhere although I guess his contract won't be AWFUL.`\Nance block was good on the replay`\>mudiay is also bigger and stronger than wall was coming into the league

Seems like even more of a reason to not compare the two players. they aren't really that similar.

>athleticism isn't all about straight line speed

No one said it doesn't? When I say athlete, I mean holistically. John Wall is amongst the most gifted athletes ever at PG. If NBA PG's were normally distributed, Wall would still be 3 SD's away from the mean. Mudiays a nice athlete but there are MANY comparable players who have similar athletic scores as he does. This was the book on him coming out of the draft. I think I even saw specifically in an article that Mudiay is a good athlete, but not on the level as elite uber athletes like Wall and Westbrook. But that's ok, let's just let Mudiay be his own person. `\Kobe`\It was, other than the scary part`\He wasn't expecting the pass, come on young fellas, the alley oops are yours.`\Yeah man I guess this guy didnt see Zootopia `\kobe is not messing around tonight`\Oladipo needs to make another leap in his game.  A 41% shooting guard just isn't going to cut it.`\0 to 100 and then back to 0 for the lakers `\Our young core (include Nance) combined for 82! `\Get some more draft picks`\Thats what they brought him here to do clown`\His turn to rest now that Mo is back.`\Ball says Flagrant. Conversation is over`\SPIN MOVE. AND ANOTHER ONE.`\o shit Nance`\I think that's mainly due to Love being the odd man out on the roster. Lebron needs to play the 4 for the Cavs to be most effective, so Love playing poorly at the PF is worse than Kyrie playing poorly at PG. Kevin Love needs to be playing better than just okay or sometimes impressive, he needs to justify displacing Lebron at his (new) natural position. I agree though, that Love is getting some whipping boy treatment - just like Pau in LA for the last few years before he left.`\Fucking insane pass`\GG Mozgov`\His twitter indicates yes`\*...on opposite day!*`\This been an awesome performance from  Vince, Allen, Chalmers and make EM DANCE LANCE!`\If Lakers win are they only ones this season to beat both 1st seeds? `\"It was me, James. The author of all your pain." - Mario 'Blofeld' Chalmers`\dunking in traffic like VC and Kobe requires a lot of athleticism. those 2 are among the best athletes ever for that position. dangelo will be a different type of player`\PLYOMETRICS THO

Lol i just want him to he the best...im digging it so far `\Its DESIIGNER!`\He just throws out irrelevant stats and doesn't really contribute. I want someone who can actually analyze what's happening, not just tell me that since Kevin Love averages 10 rebounds a game, he's good at rebouning. `\Thompson is really bad on offense.`\I wonder if Rick even thinks about his line-ups, seriously I've lost faith in his ability to make adjustments`\Theres no ice on his shoulder...theres still a chance

Hes probably gonna face up LBJ for the last 6 minutes `\Holy shit, I didn't recognize Huertas at first.`\Yeah that's some nice D.`\THE FUCK HOLDING HIS FUCKING ARMS ON BOTH SIDES`\Well since their bandwagon fans had moved to another team, their games have become tolerable.`\probably Stephenson on top of Delly in the air is the foul part.`\Maybe because mine was posted first? Not totally sure`\You're trying to tell me the five point swing caused by the refs inability to take the whistle out of his ass and call an over the back wasn't a deciding factor in the game?`\i tune in to see the return of the intimidating kelly/bass frontcourt.`\get JR outta the game before fucks that dude up`\what nba team?`\Great defensive sequence for us there `\classic ron artest foul`\Kyrie Irving : game ender. `\Lol damn ref give him a break he's playing hurt out there `\WHITE MAN CAN JUMP `\Farmar: hey man can u help me get a 10 day?

Kobe: Fuck u traitor`\Haha this thread only just got made? It's almost half time.`\Miami isn't known for being subtle.`\Was watching the Knicks-Bulls game, but looking at box score, 6/22....Jesus`\Chalmers lost them the game smh`\Kobe made the shot and they showed LBJ LMAO`\jordan and tarik both missing shots at the rim is highly unusual, let alone on back to back plays. tough break.`\Exactly, Kevin played pretty well but didn't hit a 3. Plug in Frye and he goes 5/7 from 3. Just makes the offense more explosive.`\JV team? I didn't downvote you, but now that you ask me not to I feel much more inclined to do so.

Stick to Pistons ball. Who gives a shit if you live in LA. I've lived in the Bay for half my life and I don't call the Warriors my "JV team" nor do I say "we" like they're my favorite team.......`\#HIGH ENERGY`\I don't want to come off as a jerk, but that woman on the broadcast isn't doing too well.`\They went out for brunch lol got some mimosas.`\We weren't winning this game no matter what. Cavs are on fire.  `\They look worse without Gasol, but we just haven't seen it show up in the win/loss column cause they've had a cake schedule`\Mostly in /r/laclippers`\Looked pretty clear to me on replay`\Watching Sasha Kaun play basketball is absolutely breathtaking.`\We're all superstars in Brooklyn!`\It's a basketball forum, I watched the end of the game on LP and went to the post game thread to see what people said.

It is seriously one joke, please get over it.`\Marcelo is 32 lol`\Wow, this was a pleasant surprise and we really needed it... Way to recover from the Clippers' great start.`\Tbh that's not saying much in today's game, it drops off after Harden and Derozan`\Kobe should keep nick young and russell in line`\A guard shooting 40% is a lot different than a pf`\How appropriate for the curry commercial to come on`\What a nice and friendly atmosphere we're having in this game thread. `\unfortunately so have OKC. I hope we get the second round the world wants to see, Dubs/Clips and Spurs/Thunder. `\Both teams building a mansion with all these bricks`\TARIK WHAT U DOIN?!`\At least it wasn't a spinning backfist this time, eh?`\Tbf Duncan isnt the Spurs main scoring option`\This is my point dude.  You're angry because you watched a basketball game JUST like me.  But you're team won, and so you came on here wanting a circlejerk and then you got angry at a basketball point I made.  Then you read a comment I made to someone else (not you) on another fanbase (not yours) and you immediately went in at me in a frankly inappropriate way.  You would never act like that in person whereas I would 100% tell someone who rooted for the Rockets to enjoy their swampbutt if I was at a bar because it's playful ribbing.

Calling someone a psychopath who needs therapy because they essentially root for the other team...that's something you would never do outside the context of your keyboard.

How about we agree to ignore one another from here on out though?
See you around never.`\Don't worry Cavs, you get used to it`\RYAN KELLY`\...so did we.`\We play SOOOOOOOOO much better without him. `\well that tends to happen with the lakers, just with how big the fanbase is. I know how that feels, being a broncos\patriots hater`\KOBE! `\Oh I agreed it should have been covered/mentioned, but to repeat the same thing 6 to 7 times is just too much. Talk about the current situation of the game.`\Ha did it once big mistake.`\Wait nvm `\They have...they are still Kobe fans though.`\our announcers get a lot of shit here but I don't remember them trashing opposing players`\did we get Nash after him? if that then I can totally see why we did that`\LMAO LeBron did the robot`\[Strong look at D'Angelo](https://gfycat.com/GrimyDeliciousIsabellineshrike)`\2nd best I've seen CP3 play in the last few years. Kinda lame we missed 17 threes in a row`\Yeah I know but it's still silly.`\Tony Allen finished with a perfect 12/12 from the field for 27 pts and they still lose by 7?

What is happening?`\I haven't watched many of your games this year, what would you attribute to your success since the 2014 season ended? Last season you guys notched 40 wins, and currently your win% has increased 10% comparatively.

I look at your roster and I don't see any true stars. I see IT and Bradley as good players, maybe top 10/15 in their positions(although aren't they both technically PGs? And PG is fucking stacked), I don't see any particularly lights out 3 point shooters, no dominating post presence...

So what's going on?`\haha mamba is in it`\Probably catch teams off guard, thinking they can come in and just push the Nets around`\Monster game from LeBron, but that cavs bench was absolutely awful. Also, Nets fans... at what point do we start considering Brook as the best Net ever?`\TT is not an offensive play maker.. `\[What do the two teams have in common?] (http://i.imgur.com/0Iv9Ay3.png)

He definitely deserved getting benched.`\JAZZ HYPE TRAIN CHOO CHOO`\that's fair`\Byron feelin it out mann...`\Um, no? Chalmers, Vince, Tony Allen, and occasionally Lance all make that team better than the Sixers. Would they have the same amount of wins as they do now? Obviously not, but they would not be worse than the Sixers. They'd probably be somewhere around the Nuggets, imo. `\Do you actually believe that Lebron is a bad player? Why even type that bullshit?

If *that's* our FC next year that would be a good way to stealth tank while still developing our young core considering that has almost no spacing. Simmons won't shoot from outside like 15 ft, Julius tries but is very inefficient, and Nance Jr shoots decent (not including 3s) but on low attempts. Oh and like /u/lx2UPP said Randle at C would kill our already dead defense.

He is still a long way from experiencing the success Kidd or Dr. J did. And not to be too cynical, but I doubt Brook will ever go to the finals as a starter with the Nets.

There's also the fact that, statistically, he trails Buck Williams in pretty much every category. I don't think Brook is really in the top 3 at the moment.`\Randle just created that open look for Kobe. Stay sleep`\Defensive 3 in the key is the illegal defence of today. In the 90s they just had "illegal defence" which basically meant if you werent within touching distance of a guy it was a violation 1 freethrow. Also 2 defenders couldnt be next to the same guy. While you still could double team, it was much harder as you had to sell out and double or just stay, you couldnt half go half stay and bait and defend better. Also after a double team youre team couldnt really zone 3v4 as well as they can now. I presume OP meant that without the double team Al and Brooke would be much more dominant (and big guys in general). He/she will have to elaborate otherwise. `\I was so fucking hyped for that team. Wiggins and Kyrie developing together could have been incredible to see. Fucking Bron`\Gonna be hard without Faried and Gallo. That being said...

Like part of my fandom is talking shit on your players. Fuck you. `\Not worried at all. DLo is a star. Randle is a double double machine already and if averaging a double double is his peak, well, thats a lot better than a majority of #7 picks in years past. Clarkson is a stud and his inconsistency may be a facet of his game, but if he can work through it he will be an all-star. Nance is a pleasant surprise and if he develops into part of the core great, if not then at least we'll get some highlight dunks while he is here.

`\:D`\People go gaga for athletic scoring guards with flashy handles. Plus Kyrie was in Cleveland first, and you can always fall back to the youth argument for him.

For what it's worth, I think Love can carry a team much better than Irving can. Although if you want my frank opinion, you can't win a championship with either of them as your second option unless your first option is a transcendental player. LeBron would certainly qualify, but his window is closing as his jumper fades with his age.`\I'm a witness as well, each time he adds another line`\Cavs by @ 15.

I tune in to watch the wizards from time to time because I live in the area, and the dude always seems so nonchalant with the basketball. He always has at least a couple of boneheaded turnovers every game. He rarely ever has games with only 3 turnovers or less. `\Cool man.

it takes time and patience for several superstar talents to gel and klove can adapt to lbj (unfortunately this is the case since he does lead the team) just like bosh did. in fact bosh told love that it would be hard to play with lebron. `\Why are there so many Celtics fans here?`\1st in the east.

Zaza's prime importance comes against teams with big, beefy, rebounding, physical centers. Now they play one, and he is still an afterthought on the bench as DeAndre has 13 first-half rebounds.

His knees are 50 tho lol`\KOBE WHY DO YOU HATE BEN SIMMONS`\If Len can go back to being a somewhat impactful rim protector/helpside defender I would chose him.

Dirk gets those more often than not, but you can't expect him to get every single call because he's Dirk Nowitzki.

Bottom line - Harris should've made a better pass and/or Dirk should've gotten into better position for the pass.

I'm convinced it's because Kyrie's good games make a decent highlight reel, but Love's big games involve a lot of free throws and pretty boring hook shots.

Edit: Kyrie is averaging 4 more points on 4 more shot attempts... proves how critical we are of Kevin, especially since he averages 10 rebounds on top of his scoring, which is on par with Kyrie. Hell, tonight Kyrie did *significantly* worse than Love, and I see multiple comments about how Love doesn't fit, but I don't see that about Kyrie.`\Oh my god speaking of the Bass/Kelly lineup...`\Lol`\It's hilarious how people talk so much shit about love. But look what happens when we put him in the post. He tears it up.`\>"and one, lemme get one!"

lmao`\Welp.`\That's not how middle ground works.  The flagrant 1 he was called for is the correct call and it doesn't make him dirty at all.`\This sounds like an anger management quote lol `\$200M of awesome right there`\our schedule since gasol went out has been cake, and we still managed to lose to the suns twice.  I'm still worried about playoffs.`\I hear you. But to be fair, it seems like we don't have anybody that can shoot besides Kelly and Avery and we do alright. For now, I'm down to see what he can do. And by "for now", I mean for the next couple of years.`\BENCH WES HE'S KILLING US`\Hes the new Pablo!`\"rebound the ball... pass to Kobe"

Russell: "Hes retired".

Man, has he fallen from putting up 45-19-6 against the Clippers.`\its raining 3s !!`\Can we play a Sunday evening game every week?`\you keep defending him but the fans who pay for tickets and Dan Gilbert are the ones waste their money on paying his contract...`\Frye putting on a fucking clinic.`\Our defense improved a lot one Shumpert checked in (and Redick checked out). TT being in also helps`\I gotta say Delly is low key a damn good player. He destroyed us both games with his lobs and shooting. People treat him like a joke.`\I want to punch Kyrie sometimes.`\its been a while since Harris got a charge call... maybe soon enough`\They showed it on the Cavs replay, wasn't even close to counting`\Still mad about that. `\LeBron with the LeBron tonight. 28-11-8.`\He should go become nipples on a man. Because that's how useless he is.`\He's a fucking dinosaur I swear..`\he's a shooting guard, i have no idea why we're still pretending otherwise. `\Hope he breaks 30`\anybody else's Duckstream lagging like crazy?`\Is Cleveland better without LeBron?`\Its what we do.

Hell, even the asian woman from the finals would be better.`\Are you serious`\I will tell you now, if Kyrie can't get that 3 point stroke going in the playoffs, you will see Toronto or Miami in the Finals.

But when JC has a good drive, DLo doesn't need to cut.  That time he cut off JC and turned that drive into a turnover.  I wouldn't be as annoyed if he wasn't doing it ALL GAME today.`\kings are dissapointing, all that talent and nothing to show for it. they'll have a top 10 draft pick again, but the kings are terrible at drafting players `\Shooter can't even land on the space in front of him!? Man..`\most of the cavs lost are the end of back to back, good thing playoffs dont have back to backs`\Not the Goon Squad tho`\Heat is looking very good. Seems to have our kyrptonite.

We have ridiculous cap space and we may have our pick


This team will continue to get better`\ALL HAIL`\IT trying to be Steph Curry heh`\its not fair whiteside lol`\Damn aliens stole everybody's talent.`\Damn Lou.`\Much feel good when your team is worst than the team your just lost to. The worst thing in life, being only able to live in the past. You're like the high school football player who's now 40 and spends most of his days in the bars reminiscing about the old days. `\Ally Sturm is cute af`\there were a bunch of other no calls that went against the cavs so I wouldn't blame that`\Bogdan "AP stiff arm" Bogdanovich`\The refs let both sides play all game. They definitely could have made a call there but they let a lot of stuff go all night which I don't mind if the calls are consistent which they were. Sucks to lose close game after fighting back so hard but we played hard and came back so I'm not too upset, not to mention with all of the miscues and droughts we had there is no way anyone could blame the outcome of this game on one call. `\Fuck Richard Jeffersoon, that late game foul.`\Man, if someone that didn't understand sarcasm came into this thread, they would think Temple was the GOAT.`\Why am I still watching this shit`\James Deen with the block`\Looks like Towns is going to easily with ROTM`\Huertas sandbagging like hell!`\Who is Alex??`\Nance has a hitch in his dunk`\They're also on five of the worst teams in the NBA. This whole argument is ridiculous. The Clippers and Grizzlies would be nowhere without BG/Gasol. `\Crazy that this will be the final meeting of two of the greatest to ever do it. We're watching history unfold. So much respect. `\[Let me lick your tears! Mmm, so yummy!](https://media3.giphy.com/media/RESBklbFVEaqs/200w.gif)`\I ain't even mad after that D Wade move`\a rockets fan shouldn't say the word flop`\Here comes the love-fest`\Time for Byron to put in our Exodia lineup - Huertas Young MWP Kelly Bass`\that's all ive thought about with these crazy upsets`\I'm 34 and I still get breakouts and I'm a slender,  muscle-less dude `\I thought Irving couldn't pass or assist? /s`\Who said that?

Looking at all your comments, you just seem like a dumbass.`\>wiggle it

What exactly are they wiggling?`\Great ball movement wtf`\Wasn't that a goal tend??`\>Unless if he wants to act as a backup role player

He's probably not going to have a choice. It's going to be really interesting to see his market value this summer. In an offseason where a lot of 20 million+ deals are going to get handed out, I really doubt Roy gets 10, if that. `\It tags the post and highlights it green. When there's a lot of random posts it makes it easier to find.`\Love already sitting? `\What a dumb foul.`\rip Beal`\I think he showed up on the original, shit show thread.`\Yooo this 2nd unit showing a lot of fight`\Ehhh watching the Mavs stream they seemed disappointed but they weren't really going nuts about it. It took the wind out of their sails more than it got them riled up.

As for Austin and Fred, haha yeah they'll always be on the Cavs side unless it is blatant as fuck. And even then...`\Where was the foul on that play`\Funny how the Celtics are just letting Lebron go for a layup, they know just looking at him the wrong way they will get the foul and T`\Not much you can do about that, felt like there was a lid on the basket tonight. Good game Brooklyn. `\NBA`\agreed, these little angsty teens are just mad because they aren't rational enough to have realized from the beginning of the season that this team's ceiling was and always has been the 7th or 8th seed.

I don't like what i'm seeing from this team, but I also never expected anything more of them. it would have been stupid to do so.`\Feed Kobe! `\My heart, man`\always... I honestly think he has the ability to be all defensive 1st team. Guards 2-5. `\Damn this Celtics team is on fire`\I crave a Lebron or Kyrie mess up to finish this game`\maybe, baby`\LOL Huertas steal `\Donyell had much better defense `\Randle.`\The future so bright i need to grab a pair of shades`\Damn... When LeBron is hitting those, shit's over. Even JR firing it up. Shut it down.`\[me too](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/B0lzLpJCQAEwNWf.jpg)`\Kobe and Julius forcing everything as usual.`\Dumbest thing I've ever read`\No shit. Wade was the best player on their 06 team and was their 2nd best player on the 2012 and 2013 teams. Lopez is only the best player on this team because the rest of the Nets are usually trash. Lopez hasn't even had any playoff success like Wade has. This is not a fair comparison in the slightest.`\This dudes head is in the middle of the camera wat.`\Julius "Don 'I Got Big Balls' Julio" Randle baby!`\OH SHIT I remember this photo was taken before Whiteside became well known, and people were commenting here asking who he was.`\Can Boston try a different play than sullinger post up`\Why do Cavs fans hate Crowder? I get the Olynyk hate, don't understand the Crowder hate`\delly just took it to him lol`\Our potential stars sitting on the bench lmao. Fuck you Byron`\nope, they're awful

they would need some Tyson's or PJ's or Mirza's to win.`\LeBron sick of these floppers man`\That's the game plan though. We need to game plan for him in the paint.`\He's just not confident. Even when Lue started talking about upping the pace, he started making forced passes and such, instead of what Lue wanted.`\Having JR Smith on your team must be such an emotional rollercoaster`\LEBRON JUST ENDED LOU AMUNDSON'S ALREADY DEAD CAREER`\Man this Memphis team just plays fucking hard.`\Why have you been calling them thugs up and down this whole thread?`\Right, but you didn't say what Amare did for us in his first 10-15 games, you said last season`\TRIPLE FREAKING DOUBLE FOR ZBO!!!`\Lmao Calderon pulled a Rubio`\I like this kinda party
A Jeff Green party`\A couple of easy layups/dunks missed now

Got to wake up`\Holy fuck Randle is playing smart this game! Not many "SMH" moments outta him today.


But damn we are hot since the ASB; our basketball has been beautiful to see.`\You really just talked about a man's girth and his ass. Hold this L`\I appreciate your sacrifice almighty blind one `\Ricky had three straight possessions where he hit the open man, but we couldn't hit water if we fell out of a boat. `\yeah.  don't`\/u/BlindManBaldwin, we need your blessing on this shit asap. The other thread got removed.`\He was starting in Charlotte for pretty much all season before he got traded.`\JJ GOAT`\Well, that happens to any team, but with the Cavs that's a lot of why Lue wants the team to run a lot more.  Easy layups get the energy up.  `\I'm not justifying the refs. Im saying that losing to this Grizzlies squad for the majority of the game is a loss in itself `\Just wait it gets worse `\what if a player just keeps saying blah blah blah in the ref's face all game? is that a t?`\����`\PRAISE LORD CALDERON`\Wooooow`\time to sign steve nash to a 10 day`\It took an MVP performance from Ryan Kelly for you guys not to choke this one`\Hibbert with the nice d on lopez`\I mean we can shit on Klove though right? TRADE KLOVE!!!!!! /s`\that went as expected, the wizards embarrassed themselves`\hit the gym`\Clarkson brought his A game tonight`\we need to seperate ourselves from the hawks`\Nice win, DJ + Joff bromance lives on.

Also a side note, I am really looking forward to a Mudiay-Russell rivalry in the coming years! See you guys in the WCF in a few years ;)`\I'm fully torqued `\FUCK YEA WE WANTED TO LOSE THANK YOU CALDERON`\Devin Booker the Lou stepback and foul`\Lol arent you the dude that wanted Frye to fuck your butt earlier?`\Man that interview was really good. Kobe looked happy, and I'm sure he's happy to finally walk away from the game, but I can't help but notice some sadness in his eyes.

Ah well. Pls unretire in two year Kob we need u`\Lebron should unfollow the Cavs before every game. `\The Cavs get into stretches where they think they're all the Splash Bros and don't work for better shots. `\All the terrible calls in the third quarter got to them. Every team already knows the refs give LeBron as much as possible at home though so no surprise. They shouldn't have let it affect them. `\Just did 30 years of calculation to verify that this is indeed correct and you know what that shit checks out. Today Tony Allen is a 100% 3 point shooter, 100% win rate, 100% certified badass.

league *fucked*`\Looks like he rolled his ankle...hopefully nothing worse`\Sullinger got a big ol booty`\haha the second I join the stream I get a kobe 3`\He's always (for the Cavs) had suspect hands at best. It's nothing new. He slumped HARD at the beginning of the year but post ASB he has really picked it up and been a force in the paint on defense and done a decent job on offense. `\I was about to say that most of the calls have been in the Mavs favor except Zaza getting slapped in the face, haha`\Get that shit outta here lou`\I just don't understand. He is just so worthless right now. I know he is a good player, but he simply is not working in the cavs schemes right now.`\Don't even think you guys had a moral victory `\The difference in effort between the two is amazing.`\Cavs should just let nets win! comon nets.`\Made a lot of correct passes too, despite just 3 assists. Some bricks and some well contested defensive sets`\Celtics really need to play fast to hang with the Cavs.  Once the game slowed down the Celtics struggled to get as good of shots, the Cavs can pick on matchups more, and the Cavs bigs had a great game on the glass.  A bit disappointing after starting the game on fire, but learn from it and on to Memphis.`\beal is low-key sweet at pnr`\adios amigo`\Brent Barry: "Kobe was never really the face of the league"

What league has he been following?`\hopefully we trade away nick young and Lou Williams this offseason`\Lopez is beasting.`\Who? `\I'd gladly welcome the tie-breaker.`\he's always been garbage tbh. He has never had a shot, his only selling point is his defense `\Threeee-LO`\another giannis jumper aw yeah`\SEND THE CAVS TO SHANGHAI `\MR FOURTH QUARTERRR`\Free throws bringing us back.`\The refs that officiated this game must be moderating the threads here too, amirite?`\No super ultra late game today, so /u/BlindManBaldwin is right on time `\WITH AUTHORITY`\Man Clarkson's in a big shooting slump, can't get any kind of midrange or 3-point game to go on.`\Wanted Celtics to win.`\Why tf are we still trying to cater to Kobe!? God damn`\Frye looks like a guy who has been freed from a 5 year stint in county jail.`\[loop this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vt1Pwfnh5pc)`\Then again, we have one of the least cared about teams in the NBA.`\48 minutes of professional basketball are too much for anyone,can't blame him for the Knicks lack of depth`\Woah Kyrie`\I love Sully against love tonight. Play that matchup often!`\I mean, that's not for good reason. We foul a ton. `\You...`\https://streamable.com/zyzf Tony Allen wins crucial jump ball over LeBron. `\> tyler zeller

ngl he almost looked like kevin love`\Shin contusion. Questionable for tomorrowb`\JR is cursed always loses the 50-50 calls. I guess it's his own fault but it must be so frustrating.`\Lebron wall`\But can they play like this every game?`\Yeah me too, he da man. `\>Hinka dinka derp they have LeBron so fawk them hehe

Ftfy `\He's a hell of a player but his constant complaining puts me off`\Nick Young missing wide open 3's as usual.

Just saying `\Since when did Ric Bucher land a gig at TNT?!?`\thought itd be clarkson`\Since when has that stopped you before`\Better than Russell but not better than Mudiay`\Honestly I'm about done with this team. It's not even fun watching anymore. This lineup is fucking atrocious.`\Farmar with a great first game.

Even knowing these are Kobe's last few games doesn't make it better. It's just awful and I hate that I can't force myself to watch, but the Lakers are that bad.

Sorry am I missing something in your question?`\Fucking Boston won last game agains us only thanks to refs but now they whine like bitches`\We saw this huertas in preseason.`\He's overpaid, no question.

but I cant help but feel sad cuz Kobe wont be here for long :/`\We saw a glimpse of it against the Bucks and it really showed how good the Cavs look when they move the ball well. `\I think Gary Harris is just tired.

Minus the LeBron part. `\dammit, cavs. stop that. be good again.`\At first it looked like he fell like a bag of potatoes.  It was only after the replay it was obvious why. `\[summary](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Cc_iu0IXEAAF4OG.jpg)`\Well the difference is you've been spoiled with success.

Asking for a friend...`\Humble-ish brag`\We will be seeing replays of that move for decades to come!`\right now he needs to learn consistency. He flashes hot and then its gone.

Nah he doesn't but luckily the clips don't have anyone else really and he has his uses. If can get his 3pt% above 35 I think he could be a very decent player, maybe even starting caliber for a playoff maybe contender if he is like the 4th option.

Just kidding, man. But fuck assembling furniture. Beer is essential with that.`\Good one man! This is funny HaHa!`\> Is he worth his contract on any other team? No. Is he worth his contract on a Cavs team that couldn't replace him because of cap limitations? Absolutely yes.

That's not quite how player worth is determined.  If you paid above what other teams were willing to pay, then you paid above market value.  You bid against yourselves on this one.

What do you see in Webber? I know everyone (including myself) is crazy about Lance, but his role in a full, healthy Grizz lineup is a tough puzzle. Is Webber a safe acquisition? `\Judging by what you've seen, do you think JJ would've been a good fit on the Cavs?`\Wow Shump with 16 rebounds off the bench.  `\Roy 16 footer always been money`\Again never seen a lamer thing that a lame ass happy to get smashed in the playoffs  by actual contenders.

Tonight LBJ was balling out, the 3 day rest and the trip to Miami seemed to have helped him.`\We need additions to the vid!`\TANK TANK TANK TANK`\Lebron at the three with Frye at the four and tt at the five is terrifying in theory.

They probably need to move on from Gortat and (definitely) Nene. Morris could be the answer at the 4, but they will probably need more at the 5 and some more legit bench depth.

Absolutely. Besides JJ and CP3 it didn't look like anyone wanted to score and Crawford had an off day after hitting a deep two on his first attempt. DJ had a good game but offensively he couldn't get his hands on the ball. I know he's not a huge post threat, but still. He did have a few offensive boards and bats to keep the possession alive.

Without LeBron we need at least a couple of our role players to show up offensively and we only got Channing Frye tonight. And we still won. Sorry, not  really worried at all.

Sure! Why not! GRIT N GRIND!?! `\LMAO BARNES SHOULDA HALFCOURT SHOT THAT`\Can confirm. I was there at the game. I've never seen so many heartbroken fans when Thad's shot went in

 #tacokiller`\Okay, but if he sucks we win, and if he's great we win. There's 20 games left, what more do you want to see out of Hibbert, Sacre, and Kelly at this point.

This is the area that other tanking teams seem to understand but we don't. We hold our current assets way, way too long. It doesn't have to be a windmill rotation, but it would be cool to see if Upshaw could put up even 7 and 5 in 18 minutes. His motor has improved a lot, he's shooting over 50%, and idk if you watch D-league but it's not exactly tailored for 7 footers. It's mostly selfish guards shooting long 2s and 3s and yet he's still had some great games.

I just really don't see the point of not putting a few guys on 10-day contracts. Is it like some dumb pride thing? `\Delly easily beats Beverley since last playoffs bruh`\I thought you were full of shit but looking at the most recent there isnt' any team with winning anytime soon

LeBron doesn't need your help, refs.`\Nah, his production has been matched by Otto Porter for the most part.

But we went smaller and used guys like Kris Humphries and Jared Dudley at the 4 which really impacted our defense and rebounding and stuff like that. It's been better with Markieff Morris but he's out tonight. Also, Beal missed tons of games (as usual) which really messes up our spacing.`\I wonder what it's gonna take for Kyrie to get down and dirty on defense

From the looks of it, he'd get torched by just about everyone`\Metta is pretty much useless now might as well use Nick but nope.`\You guys literally get to have your cake and eat it to.

Though obviously LeBron isn't "the problem".  He carries us on the regular.`\True, although it definitely got a LOT worse after we fired Blatt`\You forget Cavs and Clippers for worst`\Kyrie's new nickname should be toastpoint. `\What where Wade and Lebron talking about at the end, wish i could read lips.`\So this is what happens when you don't give ellington and trob big minutes`\Yea, especially when everyone but LeBron plays this poorly. Missing fucking everything. It just happens, doesn't mean I'm super optimistic about this postseason though. This team just hasn't clicked the way they should have by now. `\It was the right call, clearly late.

But it just seemed like they took the points away without telling anyone (or Pacers commentators had no idea and they're next to the scorers?)

And did it much much later after the play when I believe there were some other stoppages in between.

But still, we had some boneheaded plays late in the game. Cavs went small and we had to match up Turner against Delly. Result, Delly big 3 to tie. `\Pacers are some chokers.

Execution slipping the past minute`\Damn that's a long time ago haha. Yeah I got into hoops around 03 and loved Dwades game. So I started watching the Heat and really liked everything about the team. Stuck with them when they were shit, just like the raiders. Now both my teams are gonna be great. I honestly never have to explain my fandom around where I live now a days. Everyone knows I never liked LeBron cause Wade was imo the best out of that draft, until ya know, LeBron took over the league. So I only bandwagon'd with Wade. Family was a football family tho so was born into the raiders. `\Please drop 40+ to get a sweet 2k moments card, Dipo. `\Hopefully games like this prove to our organization that we need a way better bench and a better coach. If any of our starters are cold, we're absolutely fucked. Our coach makes adjustments like halfway into the third quarter and even then it may be asking too much.

I hope our FO doesn't see us scraping by a Suns team and get complacent. There is a lot of hope for our future but we definitely need some changes to take it to the next level. `\What the fuck Bron`\It's pretty frustrating that the Wizards are so bad in the half-court.`\now kiss`\"Bully" lol sorry Celtics are physical and play hard, better than isos.

If you watched him in Minnesota, he loved to get that inbound pass and do the fake handoff and pop the 3 at the left wing. Worked every time. His arguably best skill was rebounding, so just sticking him in the corner where he can't grab boards is making him the same player as Channing Frye which he's super overqualified for.

It's that a technical?`\Knee soreness`\Post-allstar break we might have the most efficient back court.`\It's the same as color vs colour both are correct (UK vs US spelling)`\If you dislike them for that reason, Tommy is way worse than Scal. Mike Gorman and Scal are probably near league average when it comes to blatant homer stuff`\Well this got out of hand...`\Shooting? Driving to the basket? He's on of the best dribblers in the league? Finishing at the rim? Do you watch basketball?`\Clarkson... Defense? `\I honestly don't think it has anything to do with our schemes anymore, he is missing wide open shots and seems to be weak af in the post, he can't even back down some 3's anymore. Unless he gets bailed out and gets 10-15 free throws he has a bad game`\Voodoo Kobe`\#DAE MUDIAY A BUST?!

Edit: Just wanted to point out all the shit Mudiay was getting yesterday. D-Lo has a superb game and suddenly Mudiay is trash? The fuck?`\ANGELA`\There he is! Better late than never!`\Because of the flops? I can understand that, but I'm kind of numb to them. Seems like everyone does it and it's a part of the game until the league cracks down more. `\Michigan State wins if anyone cares`\THERE YOU GO`\Ugh`\you're not a fan of him?`\good luck with that bruh

no seriously, good luck. go beat 'em down`\Channing was such a great piece for the Cavs to pick up. Really underrated move, especially since he came for almost free. Unfortunately for them the Warriors landed Andy and he looks like he's fitting in there well.`\Just recently though, the nets have been destroying lebron `\That's one clutch 39-year old man.  `\I thought Love was surely leaving in free agency... oh fuck... I am way behind..`\Pretty sure LAC has hit more long threes than we have 3s in general`\This is a sick joke

I know losing this game helps us a lot in the long run

But why in God's name do we have to play Huertas Nance and Kelly down the stretch when we have future stars on the bench

I wanna fucking die`\The Cavs players declined their 4th quarter option.`\Just because it's Cavs related doesn't mean there are only going to be Cavs fans in the thread... In fact Cavs related posts probably have one of, if not the highest number of comments from other fan bases on a consistent basis. Saying that Steph isn't the best player in the world anywhere around r/nba is downright blasphemy these days.`\Even if Lebron "isn't" the best player in the NBA anymore he's the best player since MJ and is probably top-5 all time. How quickly people forget.`\ooooh oohhh oww owwwwww`\Refs missed like 5 calls there`\you know what salt taste like tho`\They don't call him Marcelo "Bom Jogador de Basquete" Huertas for nothing.`\So Kevin Love is in a shooting slump post ASB. I think he is obviously going to turn it around. People are so reactionary with him "fitting in".`\I wonder how much video editing it takes in those kia ads to make lebron's hair less patchy`\Randle is beast right now`\LeBron misses transition basket? Must have been a foul.  `\Is that whats going on? I just assumed everything coming out of cleveland is a zero.`\Not really`\When Trick-or-Treat Tony Allen gets 26, you just tip your cap. Fun game.`\Kyrie shot it well, but he was awful all night. Terribly sloppy possessions on offense and consistently out of place on defense. `\Rick barry`\So looks like Kris Humphries is actually a thing.`\This was the first game the LA Lakers fanbase cheered and loved RKelly`\Kobe Kobe Kobe!`\To be fair though you probably would have been swept without LeBron.

But you wouldn't have been there either.`\gotta get more minutes for Tarik`\Maybe, just maybe Kevin Love was never that good. And all his Twolve stats were empty numbers. Back before the days of Lob City, there was this wierd season where Chris Kaman averaged 19/9 and was selected to the Allstar team. Kaman isn't an AllStar, in his prime he wasn't good enough to be a starter. But when your on a crappie team it's pretty easy to put up big numbers.`\He looked at his feet and still stepped out of bounds haha`\makes much more sense now haha`\You keep repeating of how the refs are the only reason the Mavs came back, as if they aren't capable of coming back against a team missing their superstar. `\Dont get that foul on Hollins`\I wanted to say this all season long. Toronto Sends their regard `\This was an expected blowout, and you guys shit on that.  Solid, solid victory. Memphis stepped up and you deserved that win.

Well played.

Anyway, the play they had set up was fine. Kyrie had a good look, he just missed. LeBron set it up perfectly as the inbounder.`\Lebron wtf....`\Thanks Wallstar`\100%. `\Lou: "I'm just going to throw an alley oop to nance with 2 guys in front of him"`\Scott's mad they're still in it`\Matthew "Token" Dellevedova `\I keepin it classy with busch light over here`\A bottle of Jack and a healthy point guard.

The tank moves on.`\Hell even Huertas had a decent game in addition to Tarik Black.


Huertas would have gotten 10 assists if the Black/Bass could make their easy shots (Bass missed 2 open jumpers which is absolutely unacceptable).`\Link?`\Do you not remember Kyrie playing great defense in game 1?
`\Predictions?

I also hope we don't have this many turnovers, defensive lapses, and shit 3-point shooting ever again... oh my god was that hard to watch.`\Holy cow Melo. Putting this team on his back`\Ryan kelly, GOAT tank player`\Holy shit Allen`\That's probably true, although I hate that team and even sweeping them was a drag because of how chippy things got. I think we make and win the ECF either way (our run last year gives me confidence against our own conference but I see us falling short again), but match up - wise you are likely correct.

How's Bosh? Because that situation likely decides your fate.`\That game where he "went off" was also the game Golden State started going small (and winning). That 20+ point performance was inefficient, slow basketball and it resulted in a loss followed by benching Mozgov in an attempt to compete.

I'm Taking My Talents to South Beach 2: Electric Boogaloo`\Well that was fun.`\what`\I'm not overly worried about him. He still put up 12/9 while missing open 3s and a couple free throws. I'm hoping his 3 shot will start to fall in the next couple games. He looked to be aggressive and get to the line early in the game. Even though his shots aren't falling he's still finding ways to contribute `\I think its the only way to keep Kyie's confidence up... let him run the show a bit more. Lebon knows he can't just be a plowhorse every single night in his 30's.`\Ah yes, Zaza has been in perfect position for rebounds so far early and this is the perfect game to use him heavily to counter DeAndre...

Jamaal Charles goes down, Chiefs go from 1-4 to 11-5 and make the playoffs. Seahawks are 3-4 when Marshawn Lynch plays, but finish 10-6 and look strong heading into the playoffs. `\"Do Less"

He now has rolled it twice since getting drafted.`\Nah, I could see him sneaking in around #6-7`\Randle with dat handle`\Roy Hibbert on the floor...drink`\Whiteside? Nance slides to the bench.`\Could be homer goggles, maybe not, but Kevin Love stood tall and took the contact, causing him to fall backwards and take the charge. You could see Crowder start to fall back before Kyrie even came into contact with him, which would make that a blocking foul. You can't be shying away from contact like that to sell a call, especially when one of the smaller players in the league is coming at you.`\RJ and K-Mart both proved to be a product of Kidd(on the offensive end). Both were young, well RJ was still young.

Kidd was the only healthy guy at the time, Kittles was fresh off a serious injury, Martin was drafted with a bad leg, Jefferson hurt his wrist which ailed him throughout his career.

You got to slow your roll, bro and realize this is the internet, not your own personal psychiatric diagnosis clinic.

I'm bitching about a call.  That's what the internet is for.  Get a clue and don't get personal with strangers who you don't know.`\So you hear a years-old anecdote and hate him`\That is almost sad. `\Also, uhh the thread is 3 minutes old.`\Why even defend Wes at this stage.`\am i retarded or was bosh a great rebounder for the raps?`\Thank you.`\True. Any team with international scouts knew how good he was. I even think he took a huge discount to play on the Lakers.

He was still very, very raw coming in. Tankmaster Scott likely didn't help much, either.`\suck it Mark.`\Is there really a good use of the word "rape"?  I hate t as a verb synonymous with "owned", "dominated", or "best up".

Think about how sad that is.  People live every day with memories of getting raped, ravaged, and brutalized.  Women are afraid to walk at night because people objectify them as sexual objects.  People kill themselves because they cannot overcome the emotional damage done to them.  Yet here we are.

I do not mean to go on a tangent, but if we all become socially aware about our ways and grow as peopleit would be fantastic.

On a less serious note, I miss the post game-the foot work, the body control.  I love classic centers.`\Who?`\Lebron is settling for a lot of shots where I feel like he would normally drive to the hoop.

Team is soft as doggy doo.`\We can't hit anything tonight man`\okay i can get that you don't like lawler but you don't just make fun of people for having strokes that's pretty shitty (although it wasn't a stroke)`\Alright grizz. Time to stop sucking ass`\This is one of the biggest circlejerks here and the only numbers I see thrown around are his assists numbers compared to other great pg's. Everyone talks about this guy like he's a veteran and he just turned 24. `\There's always Thick as a Brick.

No seriously it would be your Magnum Opus. `\Yeah it would, generally though big men have to face more double teams though because it is easier to double a big and rotate than it is to try to double a guard on the perimiter.

D'Angelo wide open in the corner after getting that steal and he decides to get called for a offensive foul.`\Yeah it was a missed free throw, but it still deflected so Pacers were out running and Ellis missed a layup on the break.

Remember when the Warriors lost to the Lakers a couple weeks back? W's are W's and LeBronless W's mean even more than that. If LeBron were to be injured we would be screwed. If Kawhi were to be injured the Spurs would be screwed. If Curry were to be injured the Warriors would be screwed. I could go on.

Remember the LBJ we got in the Finals last year? He averaged more points, assists, and rebounds than anyone on either the dubs or cavs. If LeBron is healthy the Cavs have a good chance to win the title, bar none. If Kyrie and Love are healthy we stand an even better shot, but we didn't need Love or Kyrie to take the dubs to 6. We don't need to play perfect games against every regular season opponent to demonstrate that, that's just ridiculous. `\The Kevin Love rumours are gonna be going on for the next month`\Love that jumper off the curl for AB`\That celebration by Russell, Randle, and Clarkson at the end brought tears to my eyes ;)`\Tyronn Lue is one ugly motherfucker.

We aren't talking about who won that game or record. We're talking about who is more likely to win a future matchup. Past record doesn't matter.

The Celtics scraping by in a game they didn't deserve to win doesnt somehow make them more likely to win the next game.

Solid player.`\Well he had some back problems over the offseason and was still dealing with that at the beginning of this season so he struggled mightily for a while but he has picked it up post ASB.

He has a long way to go, and depending on the Lakers' 2016 draft, there's a chance he doesn't even get called up next season.

My question is, why does Doc still go to Jamal? I honestly don't understand what the logic is.

If the Cavs face the Heat down the road, they absolutely have to put Mozgov in on Whiteside. He ate Tristan Thompson alive tonight.`\Going to the Hawks game for the half, brb`\Of course Asik had his best game of the season when he don't need wins.

You big motherfucker. `\This was just straight porn for 2 hours. Just... amazingness the entire game. I don't even think I can find a single thing to complain about. Legitimately not a single thing... LeBron did his best, he had a few flashy dunks that were dope, but literally nothing else from no one other than when it was garbage time.

* D-Wade scoring his 20,000th point at home and vs LeBron in a massive dominant blowout? Poetic.
* Dragic going up and trying to slam it down on his dunk attempt was frigging hilarious.
* Josh Richardson deserves legit ROTY nomination. He won't get it, but he's INCREDIBLE right now.
* We had our highest point lead of the season (33 points) and win by  19 points... Cavs are 49-19.
* Whiteside didn't get big stats when the game was still slightly close and it didn't even matter.
* Cleveland/LeBron now drop to 0-4 against the Heat in Miami since LeBron returned.

I have no words. JJ and Dragic were also both awesome I should mention as well. Gerald Green and UD even got some minutes. A crazy end point total(122) and now we've scored 100+ points in 10 straight games. This was so much fun and so relieving after the intense close loss vs Charlotte. Considering they dropped a game vs Denver, this really was massive. Now we get to enjoy a well-earned couple days off and get ready for a 3-game road-trip starting on Tuesday vs New Orleans. Canes also advance to the Sweet 16... today literally can't get any better.`\So fans can't throw them on the court or at anyone.`\If you actually read the fine print in the commercial they warn you of that.

that's nice`\These three were pretty different players.`\True, that was an atrocious no call in a critical time, but the cavs played an atrocious game too. The fact that the grizz were down 7 players, most of them key guys, and it came down to a blown call is pretty pathetic.

And hey, at least the refs decided to be consistent and blow a call in the last minute that they were blowing all game`\So the Mavs are only in the playoffs now by 3 games, and are 4-6 over their last 10.

Kyrie's a better player for sure (well, scorer anyway), but this would be the monster team that they want to be if Kyrie went off for 30 every game against opposing teams 2nd units, while Delly obviously works great as a pass first facilitator alongside Lebron.

Up and down all the time--he's had some great games, some piss poor games, and a lot of meh games. It's the same for most rookies; I'd say only Towns and Okafor have consistently put up good numbers this year. Mudiay, Russel, Porzingis, Myles Turner, Booker, Jokic, etc have had some great stretches but are consistently inconsistent. `\40-foot run up to that jam

They are so damn efficient.

Nance has known his role since day 1 but hes getting confident in his jumper again.

And now Randle is figuring his role out. He's our go to ISO guy when the play they planned breaks down, but otherwise a passer (like ZBo mixed with Draymond).

Everything is progressing exactly how I wanted and predicted it would. `\What a shitshow of a game.`\Your announcers are homers.  Lebron wasnt evem touched on the spin move.  Come on.  `\Not a good percentage on the season but he's been doing better lately and I'm sure the Clippers are aware of that.`\Damn, didn't necessarily expect a W, but a blowout ...
Not to downplay the Cavs, they played well, but some Clippers played straight up terrible!


From both starting teams JR Smith was shooting very well tonight, while Jeff Green was on one of his off nights again. Luc Mbah a Moute was a good defense presence, but he keeps lacking on the offensive end.


The Clippers bench got totally outperformed. Channing Frye shot very well and Tristan Thompson dominated over Aldrich. Meanwhile Austin Rivers wasn't playing very well and Jamal had another off night, but still kept chucking up shots.

This game showed clearly that while the Clippers have been playing very decently without Blake, we need him against tougher opponents for his scoring ability.`\It's longer than the lines at Disney`\he's so confused.`\LeBron with a extra bit of oomph in that foul lmao`\Following Lance Stephenson on Snapchat is shaping up to be one of my best ever decisions`\They ain't ready for tha KANG`\������`\Would it make sense for Porzingis to bulk up?

Still don't like the Harden comp though.`\A major part of the problem is that they don't run any kind of real offense though, and based on reports, that's because it's what Lebron wants.`\...You must have missed the part where I said *twice* that the Cavs don't care about the contract because of the luxury tax they were paying anyway. That still doesn't change the fact that it's a bad contract for his talent and ability. Yeah, he's a good garbage man type player who does the dirty stuff you want, but he's still not as good as what he's being paid for. I'll say it one last time, I know Gilbert and the Cavs don't mind as long as they're contending for a title. So stop patronizing me about how I can't think critically and look at just the box scores just because you're getting all defensive, even though I'm strictly talking about his contract value. The reality is he's overpaid for what he brings. It doesn't matter, but the people acting like he's worth his contract are delusional. `\If Frye made that smh`\What does anyone care about anything.

Things about to go downhill in a hurry sadly. Maybe we can pull a Lakers and kick GSW's butt once.`\Is this even the correct game thread?  Why is it so dead?  I know it's Saturday....oh, everyone is watching the tournament eh?`\I'm loving our threes right now`\Kyrie with 8 assists. Checkmate, /r/nba `\[when your team is trash so all you have are memes to make you smile](http://imgur.com/gCbw5N5)`\Small price to pay for our shitposting ways `\I don't think this teams defense will be fixed before experiencing another training camp.

They did it earlier with Tayshaun and KG earlier though so at least we know 3/5 of the starters have the ability to play solid defense.`\just gave up 2 ORebs to Young in a row...`\This is another era.

PGs now are Westbrook, Rose, Thomas, Jackson, Jennings, Knight, Curry... Passing is not the main thing, they get assists because they attract people. If you are a teammate you will end up alone because somebody needs to double that PG.

If you ask me. I like Paul, Rondo, Rubio, Conley... but it's 2016 and that's it, that's the way it is. I'm a big fan of the old PGs, those players with *vision*

I get what you're saying, but it's the new NBA. I don't like those PGs neither, but they're too good shooting. `\Cobe pls`\Steph "D-LOADING" Curry`\Turbo picks.

High speed turbo picks`\I feel like the cavs should bring love off the bench and start Channing `\Can we make a 3?`\DON JULIO`\so they *weren't* talking about AARP?`\Ain't that the goddamn truth. Lions are my clear 2nd team though. So I get a good mix of the good and the bad every year. `\Best outcome for Cs. `\commenting works again?`\Good game Cavs! Vic almost willed this team to victory`\Cry me a river`\well then`\Kyrie is a worse defender and floor general than every other player you listed (okay, fine, Jennings' defense is worse). Granted a healthy Kyrie is a better scorer than everyone you listed except Westbrook and Curry, but he is not a PG I'd want leading my team. He is a great scoring guard that does absolutely nothing else. He's too one-dimensional. LeBron is the perfect player to complement his weaknesses yet Kyrie still can't learn how to move without the basketball. `\Really awesome that Grizzlies did so well with only 8 active players. You can tell me didn't try our hardest. I know we're waiting to play to our greatest potential come playoffs but it does help to care about each game.`\HOW SWAY??`\Man, Kobe and LeBron giving us a hell of a show tonight.`\LeBron got all this help but Cleveland still never getting a ring `\JR is a classic pest. I love his crazy ass.`\Playoff Cavs are kicking in!`\#GO CLIPPERS `\Love is looking like hot garbage out there tonight.`\I believe it is.

In Kobe Bryant's final visit to Utah, the Jazz handed the Lakers a 123-75 loss. The 48-point margin matches the biggest win in Jazz history and the biggest loss in Lakers history. L.A. was outscored by 44 points in Bryant's 28 minutes, the worst single-game performance of his career. -ESPN`\/r/heat game thread has more comments than this thread`\It's balancing chair guy!`\I got you mate http://streamandme.me/`\ohhh wahhh, life is hard no one likes you.`\CHALMERS!`\Kelly set up that. He knew Bass is coming so he gets block and ball go to Bass....

please let go of Kelly`\Lakers guard defense is sooooo bad

Edit: Downvote if you want but you guys just made Mudiay and DJ Augustine look like offensive stars`\Don't downvote the man, he didn't say anything negative and he isn't even the same person. All he did was answer a question that I asked.`\4.

Oh yeah cavs fan`\Russell swatted that Knight jumper tho`\To no one's surprise, Dirk at the 5 is killing us defensively. `\Damn, gotta give the Grizz their due. They wanted it more with a super depleted team. ZBo was a fucking weapon tonight.

It's typical for this year now. GG`\Damn we are really getting the B-team from TNT. Fucking Ric Bucher?`\come on, you gotta admit the quality of basketball is pretty standard`\Slippin'`\Lakers suck`\This is where the stats don't tell the whole story. lebron came in with 6 minutes left in the 4th, cavs were in the lead. he went 0-2 and let bojan and young score on him, then kept deferring to everyone else instead of taking the shot. it was weird.

great game from him otherwise. `\well theres no curry and iggy and I like watching battle of the tanks`\Plenty of time left.`\Bosh would be an amazing center on a team that fully commits to small ball. `\"Grizilla"

I'm dead`\Cleveland better hope they don't run into us in the playoffs.`\yeah 16 down end of third

im gonna go back to <shudders> work`\Good guy Cleveland, helping us get a better draft pick`\I'm ready to see Russell start and get bench minutes again.`\Possibly the craziest part of this game is how full the arena still is.

The kids ain't played enough to warrant this`\Think his career high so far is 23, could go for 30 if he keeps this up.`\Yes! Go Lakers! Keep it up!`\This was not a great quarter.`\It was close enough`\second unit is fun to watch on the cavs, much less stressful`\nope ur a clown`\Question is can you fill the hole that Rondo left behind? Hes a hard player to replace`\Love is learning how to play on a winning team.  I thought he was right to pass those up... he wasn't feeling it tonight, but still contributed all around.`\I'm not sure but he was giving them wide open looks. Just nothing fell for anyone and Kyrie kept on chucking.`\AYYYYYYY`\oh wtf kind of pass was that?`\Roy hitting cutters off the post ayy`\Not to beat a dead horse but her body language during the pregame stuff was not good.`\GIANNIS PLZ DONT SETTLE FOR 3s`\Nope`\Yes, a double-digit lead!`\Sick baby.

I forgot to save it. `\Come the fuck on grizzlies`\I hope the Magic tank after this loss, they need actual talent.`\It's on the new queue right now `\If the opposing team breaks 100 it was not a good defensive game. `\Ohh lol, reddit came alive as the game ends....`\OP please!!!`\How has he been when he plays?`\Mozgov has to have among the worst hands in the league. I think a lot of it has to do with lack of awareness, especially with LeBron's unpredictable passes.`\Len should become a pro gymnast.`\beat both of them`\man smart loves making noise when he doesn't get a foul, I like the celtics but he just needs to shut it.`\I gotta admit, it's fun watching Shroder be the bench cheerleader. I'd like seeing guys like that. Same with Korver but Shroder is funny to watch.`\wow, and I thought Dwayne Casey's play book was shit`\Damn I wished we could hear what KB and LBJ were saying on court`\wtf? I have an exam tomorrow so I can't watch but wtf man, we were playing so good

hope we can pick it up`\No problem!

He still seems explosive at times but some nights I don't even think he's going to get more than 10 points. He's played like a back up more often than a starter `\This is a great game `\DONT LET ME DOWN LEBRON LIKE YOU LET ME DOWN IN THE 2011 FINALS`\Just watch they gonna shoot a 3 at the end of that shot clock`\Well there's no back to backs in the playoffs right?`\LeBron is tired... ahahahah, again? or am I hearing things?`\im not the hawks announcers and we arent watching a hawks broadcast are we?`\Marcelo Huertas = Discount Steve Nash.`\the fond memories of drafting kittles over kobe`\Eagle deserves it

Clearly I'm talking to a man with no taste, since you have to bring politics into it. `\It seems like Kyrie slips so often `\Exactly. As soon as I'm comfortable with him pulling up, he knocks one down. `\He's a funny, nerdy dude who drops threes, drops hammers and works his ass off on defense.  What's not to love?`\I feel like despite lebron's overall good game, he's never really comfortable playing against the heat. it always seems awkward. I think us, the spurs, and the warriors are the 3 teams that affect him. the warriors/spurs because they're so good, and we're that 2012 celtics kind of team that competes very well specifically against lebron`\Celtics - 11 ft. Cavs - 25 ft. That hurts right now.`\I'm just saying that it's not luck or something, executing late in games when defenses are dialed in is a thing that separates teams at the top from teams in the middle.`\Clarkson is the future`\We can blowout the Thunder yet can't beat half a Grizzlies team led by Tony Allen. I'm doneeeeeeeee`\I thought Lebron couldn't jump anymore? `\No because he's up by 13... `\Commander Scott will take control in the 4th`\That wasn't a mauling LeBron got away with, that was a murder.`\Me included. I was just quoting Dave Chappelle though.

FUCKING FUCK

THIS TEAM IS SO FUCKING ANNOYING`\WHAT`\D'Goat`\Lmfao same thing that happened to Shump just happened to Beal and nothing called what the fuck?`\I like this guy`\Imagine how Sullinger would look in 80s uniform. Bird would have died laughing.`\If the Cavs' turnovers were the age of a human, it would be old enough to rent a car...`\Moz is so soft around the basket. DUNK THE BALL`\I just realized I've been sitting here alone in the dark grinning and smiling for the pass 15 minutes `\I wish we had a JJ Redick :(`\wow refs....tony got fouled on the fast break too`\I mean, I'll gladly take a party in mid-to-late June in Cleveland. `\I love Sully. Still wear his Buckeye jersey all the time. He was balling over Love today but let his emotions run away from him a bit. `\Thanks bud`\What constitutes as a big game? Why isnt this just a bad game for him? A game where the cavs were a huge favorite doesnt exactly scream big game. By that logic every single game the cavs play is a "big game"`\At the worst, I assumed I could just watch some JaMychal/Jarell development. Plus with Lance, I never know what to expect.`\Well of course you aren't going to feel bad about a Mavericks loss. `\Jaymicheal is the future`\Since when can Huertas shoot LOL

Dude's taking the Cavs defense to school right now`\Magic lost to the Suns and Lakers in the same week. `\Such shitty  defensive effort by Monroe to start the game. Bring in the Plumlord!`\To be fair ZBo broke his face tonight and he had to leave. `\This game is awesome. Kobe/Lebron, and DRuss/Irving. I'm so pumped for 4 quarters of this shit`\Ay man if we win we just continue to enjoy the ride. If we lose it helps the tank. :) `\The kids are growing up.......

On the court at least. :')`\THE FUTURE IS NOW. `\He appears around playoff time it seems. Probably collecting details from the season.`\Jeff Green somehow with a +13`\WHAT A FUCKING PASS WTF`\It's fine. Jerebko works hard on defense.`\Welcome back Kevin!  (Where you get all them dimes??)`\offensive foul on farmar?`\Thanks Cleveland bros? Man this is weird `\WOOOOOO! LET'S GO! Young trio came up **BIG TIME**.

 I stand by DLo even though he fucked up. I'm hyped up af rn`\TIL hanging on the rim is a tech `\As of 2 seasons ago, Time Warner bought the right to Dodger broadcasts, and only 1 other cable company (Charter I think) has agreed to the price they are demanding to have the channel. So about 2/3 of LA cannot watch Dodger games since they don't have Time Warner. Its really a shame, since this is Vin Scully's last year, and he is, in most people's minds out here, the best announcer to ever do it.`\Lebron was like "so deep, so deep put her ass ta sleep"`\That was the worst fastbreak I've ever seen`\Seeing Sasha is just a sad reminder of how long it's been... I miss those teams, man.`\thx bro <3`\as in lakers fans win`\To be fair, I think we can treat Huertas like a rookie in that it took him a few while to get used to playing in the NBA. He looked lost/bad early season but he's really translated his game well. We need to keep him for sure.`\WHOOO OH MY GOODNESS LEBRON`\In a race between Jeff Teague and The Flash, how many times does Teague make it to the basket before The Flash does it once?`\Ohh yeah, i forgot`\Kyrie Irving is 23 years old... Steph is 28. you dumb or something?`\What do cavs fans think about bringing love off the bench? The ball movement looked amazing yesterday and you have shumpert to defend whatever guard is gonna give kyrie trouble on defense? `\I was moreso talking about Zeller`\with 3 perimeter players around lebron, absolutely`\This true, but I liked to see KLove nut up and go in like that. Yeah, maybe could have saved a few possessions and got a couple buckets off swinging it out, but he didn't look soft as fuck tonight like he usually does.`\Danny sucks`\Suffocating Cleveland defense? Oh Kyrie is not on the floor`\WHAT IS HAPPENING `\>thugs

Please`\You're right. A better time was the 2nd quarter when he went 0/2 from the line`\Well at least we didn't just completely shut it down and give up when we were down like 14 halfway through the third. Obviously this is a team that shouldn't be having any "moral" victories but there is a silver lining here even if it is damn near invisible. `\Kobe clearly drained Clarkson of his youthful vitality for this game.`\KO5ringsBE`\they will always give props to any player who is doing well also. theyve been all on kyries nuts this evening. pretty cool if you ask me `\late closeout, but okay.  anyone who watches lebron can tell`\I love listening to Austin Carr. They are way too over the top. I can see why people not rooting for the cavs would get annoyed. `\an injured one :(`\Fanduel?`\This is essentially a Lakers home game. Hopefully that inspires them to win. `\Anyone got a streamable of CP's ridiculous assist to DJ?`\Bass working real hard, appreciate that`\He's on fire!!!!`\I need that in my life now! What's his user name? `\Pretty much the only reason still buy tickets to watch this shit show

He's rwally fucking over his home fans with this bullshit where he'd rather play in away games and sit home games`\Injury scares happen. Stings a bit, but then feels fine in a bit`\Better off without Blake eh? Yup. I believe it.`\Grizz: 17 Offensive rebounds
Clips: 2

thank goodness we're 45% at the 3.`\ooh bradley you need to make those.`\Looks like he just tweaked it nothing serious `\Even the officiating report said we should have won essentially lol`\Dia de las Huertas`\Mozgov lane violation on his first free throw`\He's more than doubled his season average points and fg% lol.`\kyri3333333`\Yet we still have a better record`\Oladipo pls stop`\Sit the starters. Shooting 80% threes and shit just not even worth risking an injury this late in the season.`\Please don't win please don't win please don't win`\Nuggets have been good this season. Mudiay, Jokic, Nurkic are solid building blocks. He just needs the summer to work on his jumpshot and he can become a really good PG. Dunno what was wrong with Gary though.`\kyrie on fucking fire`\I dont get this joke`\No, the Raptors looked like shit after the all star break last year. If at this time last year you told me the Raptors could take a single game from the Cavs in the playoffs, I would have laughed.`\Do you expect a shooting guard to pass first?`\[dat LeBron finish](https://i.imgur.com/kAu3LHd.jpg)`\Clarkson is our best player on offense usually, and consistently, this is the rare off night tonight.`\Yea he's a beast when he starts at C...looking more and more like Mozzy won't be back next season. `\That could be a mental thing though. Once he adjusts to the nba I think dlo will drive alot more and use his 6'5 frame and huge wingspan.`\I came into this game wanting the Celtics to win, but the way their playing I'm starting to feel very threatened and now I want them to calm down a bit and stop playing so well.`\Who the hell said that? Thanks for the hasty generalization.`\This just isn't fair. I feel bad for Memphis fans.`\Well it's not like they did anything wrong `\Isn't it kinda the same thing with Peyton Manning.  When you let your star run the show, great things do not happen.  ALl reports just point to James running wild and doing what he wants.`\Cant wait for Barea to be off this team tho, ppl overrate him for 2011 when he's not even a good player, has worse shot election than Westbrook and worse defense. Charlie should've been waived along time ago, he just jacks up shots beyond the 3pt line thinking he's a player in 2K`\And somehow is still averaging 25 a game. He's a machine. `\Wolves inability to use their size advantage is a joke. `\Ball movement is fun`\ECF are pretty far away tho`\Oh good it's Brent Barry thank god`\#THANK YOU R. KELLY`\Yeah but now that I'm hoping for blowouts they're being competitive, even having won a couple in a row. Now, it's better to lose and it absolutely kills me inside to say that. I wish they had at least been competitive throughout the season. Would have been easier to stomach.`\It's his first year. He's gone and never to be seen again after this season.`\David Stern`\That lebron crying face is classic`\The Pacer commentators would just not stfu about the stupid 3 point shot that was rightfully taken away because it was after the shot clock had expired. `\Missed u 2 babe`\Ok, Morris is fucking hot. Feed him til he misses.`\Have faith in the Goon Squad!`\http://i.imgur.com/8ZFXMG9.jpg

At the bar before the quarter break again lol`\Yeah this shit is so over played.  You don't need to have fun to play good basketball.  I don't give a cadillac fuck if they go 3 rounds in the parking lot after a game, as long as they can play good ball for 48 minuets. `\Ayy they got ponchos and sombreros out here`\LMAO`\Austin Rivers dropping buckets on his former team`\Jesus Christ these threes`\Goon squad beats full strength Cavs. `\Anyone notice Lopez travel when he got the ball? I can't be the only one `\I'm about to get dizzy`\You sir are right

S is off`\If by Bucks you mean Antetokounmpo, then yes.

`\Good. Gooooood.`\Hopefully. Kyrie and Love can't seem to play well together. `\Celtics/Cavs thread are always shit shows

Frankly, I enjoy this`\It be pretty cool if the Knicks came back and won. Knicks have nearly doubled their win total from last season and win tonight would a nice win for the Knicks and their fans.`\I just watched a rather long Tony Allen offensive montage.  These are strange days indeed.`\I'm wondering the same this is insane.`\Melo really facilitating out there`\"Deandre cuts the crust off his pb&j" lmao`\Fuck it let vintage Kobe finish it, I already gave up on life. `\This thread is a ghost town. So much has happened. New mascot, Balmer dunks, everyone chucks, and a kid wins a car with a half court shot. Oh and the clips are winning. `\He hasn't shown it in the league yet. I'll take the proven player 100/100 times in this situation. There are plenty of great college passers who don't become great nba passers and DLo hasn't shown enough to say he has elite court vision this year. `\Nene running fast break and passing for Sessions lay-up, Wizards Basketball.`\Shit I wish he'd stop trying now just so he doesn't get injured too.`\Dat return on investment`\But honestly I never understood why everyone thought love would be a huge 3 point game, he was a guy that would kill you in the post on both ends and then hit 1 or 2 threes. I don't understand how that translated to he's  one of the best 3 point shooters in the league and he needs to stay out the paint. `\Love REALLY needs to find his 3 ball soon... he's been slumping hard lately.`\Yuck clippers have another game in less than 24 hours after this one
`\Who is Wall yelling at?`\Because that's how basketball works? No change of possession.`\LAKERS STACKED, LEAGUE FUCKED`\My friends and I were just saying that! I don't think there's many situations where home fans should boo their player, this definitely was not one of them. `\Chillin' up on the roof with Baghead`\DJ Khaled just posted that video he took with Bron on his Snapchat. `\/u/BlindManBaldwin PLS!`\Obama won a Nobel peace prize, doesn't mean he deserved it.`\That was amazing.  First he gives an offensive foul (uncalled) to knock down his defender, then he can't get up high enough to get the basket in undefended, then he gets blocked.  `\Oladipo having himself a game, huh`\Everyone throwing salt at the Cavs right now. Just leave the thread now this is where I'm ending it.`\Dammit, TA. Why you do dis?`\When ever we catch terrorists, we should tie them to a chair and make them watch this game

The first time the two teams played, sure Hassan got 9 rebounds, a solid number, but that number was matched by Tristan Thompson coming off the bench. Meanwhile Kevin Love snagged **14** rebounds. The Cavs ended up outrebounding the Heat by 11 that night.

It gets even worse when you look at RB%: Even when you look at the Cavs loss to the Heat, the Heat pulled down 78 and 10 percent of defensive and offensive rebounds, respectively. The Cavs rebounded 89 and 22 percent of defensive and offensive boards. The loss was primarily due to Lebron's absence leading to an abysmal sub-40% shooting night for the team.

Whiteside and the Heat present plenty of their own issues for the Cavs, but rebounding is one thing that rarely, if ever, troubles this team`\wish i could watch this ass whooping

I've been trying to stay positive about K Love for so long but he's just fucking garbage on this team man- has like once decent performance every 5 games. Kyrie was truly woeful in this game, and the whole second unit just looks confused and lost when Lebron's not on the floor. Scrap that. The whole roster looks confused and lost when Lebron's not on the floor. I don't want to detract from Brooklyn's play tonight, but I feel like Cavs abysmal performance overshadowed that beyond compare.

Really Randle is the only guy consistently rebounding because of that. I still like Nance Jr and Huertas, but really, it's a clusterfuck.`\It's the NBA man, all of these guys a professionals. And it's not like we lack talent, just effort and defense.`\He probably has reddit account. Saw the shit they posted about him.`\How is saying he's not as good as Steph trashing him?`\hyped*`\But what if he played spring training games with the marlins? `\Yeah, the rest of the Cavs need to step it up now as well though`\Oh a player gets praised for playing well! What a travesty!!! Would you rather some rando reporter lob shots at him on completely unsubstantiated claims? And then the whole sub clamor to pile on?`\I didn't get to watch but I'm really surprised because we have the worst PG rotation/backcourt in the league haha`\Is that considered a missed shot and a rebound or an assist?`\To be fair, the Lakers are playing one of the best defenses in the NBA tonight.`\Lakers, how had Lou Will been for you guys? `\Bernie pls
`\We'll just be 2 games back forever`\Lou is the anti tank tho. He makes buckets and draws fouls he has no business making and for that I hate him`\Great win, I think Love and Irving NEEDED this.`\Kings are actually my West team.

I'm an East Coast Lakers fan but enjoy watching the Kings fuck everyone up in the playoffs.`\Shumpert was looking for an adult after Crawford had him on skates.`\OH MY`\What the fuck are all you guys talking about? There's like three cavs fans in this thread dude.

Edit: I apologize that I'm a Cavs fan and that it offended you guys. `\Dear Lord what if we always passed like that...`\R Kelly bricking us straight to the #2 pick`\He has tunnel vision when he has the ball... he's a point guard by name only.`\I'm 29, been watching NBA basketball since I was 9. It just hit me he's been playing for nearly 2 decades and soon he will be gone :(`\obviously you've never seen playoff dellavedova `\Hahah`\Naw. This a 1 v 3 matchup. Important game for both sides, but ur flattering yourself if you think that this game is an end-all-be-all for us.`\Fouling too much and allowing second chance points.  What else is new?`\Pls`\Seems like Huertas has more than just one steal...`\You guys, I think Russell is pretty fucking good. `\the good old Cleveland carpet bombing`\If Memphis was healthy we'd be up by 15 right now.

What a great night all around for our starters.`\eh.. one of their PGs are currently injured.`\Mario Chalmers always shows up for big games`\Kobe is a legend `\McCallum is a slow starter. 1 point in the first half yesterday, and 0 today.`\Kyrie has shown a lot more in his time as a Cav than love has though`\LeBron has started embracing faking screens for himself, and giving the first screener a screen for curling.`\Lol that's Nene's 3rd three attempt in 2 games.`\Steve Nash runner by Marcelo again ayy`\I wanna say Bellineli got fined`\Whos bitch is this?`\I actually am fine keeping Huertas now, he has shown good bench production`\THAT WAS CLEAN AS FUCK WTF

LMAO`\SAUSHA KAUN!`\I think the 25 turnovers had more to do with it`\Kobe turnaround J.`\He's just bad? :/ I'm not sure his can be fixed which means he'll have to become extremely efficient and shoot out whoever he's guarding (he has his streaks but it needs to be consistent). A lot of 50-40-90 guys were defensive liabilities but it didnt matter. `\Newsflash: people who already dislike Lebron find ways to dislike Lebron more.`\The Cave didn't make the playoffs in 2011.....`\As a buckeye fan, this game made me so happy. They grow up so fast. `\THAT THIRD QUARTER MADE ME CRY TEARS OF JOY`\You get a 19-2 run, you get a 19-2 run, everyone gets a 19-2 run!`\Then get your eyes checked lmao. `\It's like no one wants to win this one`\It's borderline at best.

Arguing every call does us no favors.`\27 for Russell, 24 for Clarkson, and 23 for Randle`\WTF is that effort man. At least run back and contest it...`\Sup ninjas

Cheers`\Jamal is so bad as a passer to the roll in the pick and roll. Awful. `\Idk what's up with him in the post. His handles down low are pathetic. `\nah not philly. their tank is not the acceptable form. `\Kyrie and LeBron: 14/21 - 29 points

**This is why Kyrie is so valuable.**`\Ricky made a shot! Suck it haters`\lol`\Cleveland: It's not as bad as you think it is.....but its still really bad`\This thread is dead`\I love Russell, but when he is playing bad he is far from a steadying force. It's easy to say after this great start to the half because he's actually playing well, but when he isn't having an impact it hurts - just look at the first quarter until our bench came in.`\It's complicated`\tyler zeller is the only nba player who cant get pussy`\Mario "GOAT" Chalmers showing LeBron who really carried the Heat to back-to-back championships`\We really tried our hardest to give Dallas the win.`\Which of those guys is better than Bledsoe?

Eyes on the back of his head.`\I don't think I've ever seen that call being made late in the game. Such trash.`\Whiteside will eat Mozgov as well. Moz doesnt move as well as he did last year, his knee surgery really slowed him down.`\We have to listen to Jon Barry. Fuck.`\What the halftime report should be about:

For the Lakers:

* The lakers suck and that they are in the tank progress
* Lou coming back pretty much makes the game less exciting because he's gonna go to the foul line about 15 times more than the whole squad does, and of course he'll be the highest scoring guard off the bench at the end of the game
* We all hate Lou and wish he was never picked up (and he would've thrived on a team like the Knicks and the 76ers, who need more scoring)
* ALL 4 DA TANK

For Knicks:

* Another Disappointing season, another Melo saga.
* KP6 the latvian prince
* The coach needs to be fired
* Calderon and his "leadership" is leading to another tankful season`\Boys becoming men, men becoming bucks.`\Huertas is one sneaky motherfucker`\I really enjoy Ersan`\That's another uncalled LeBron murder holy shit he's racking those up this year`\Jeez I got down voted. But yeah Kyrie would be good because of the return they would get, but I still think it's Love.`\Draymond Green`\LOL`\Look at what happens when Kobe doesn't take 25 shots a game.`\Pretty sure it is. The feed that I get at half-time is just what comes on the jumbotron with the sound coming through the arena system, so you wouldn't hear crowd noise. You can tell because of how the sound comes through clear and not like it's being recorded, like it is in [this one](https://streamable.com/5zvb) `\Woah since when can the Cavs shoot `\I would love for them to win, but its not a do or die as fans want it to be.`\that should be obvious. There is no excuse for either of them to be our first PF off the bench. But Greg being our 3rd option in the frontcourt is something that I can get behind. He sets good screens, plays decent defense, and can rebound fairly well. Not very much offense however`\Man I still love the days of Riley's Knicks.  Everything was grinding and physical and there were rarely any uncontested shots.`\How is Bosh doing btw?`\:)`\Wade totally thought hed get Dlo to jump into him `\can you pass without turning it over? `\Brandon Jennings scored 55 in his rookie season. He is now the backup point guard for the Magic.`\The one that just beat the clippers? Without Ryan Anderson either? `\Untitled 5?`\meh I think OKC would take care of Portland in 5 games`\MVP: Cavs

LVP: Mods for deleting the other, better, cooler thread`\No I'm not bringing politics. I'm bringing another man who won an award and then failed afterwards to keep those values.`\...or it could be that LeBron is really good at getting to the FT line`\Refs won't even review the time for us lmao`\Cavs killed us on the offensive glass and utilizing the corner 3. Perimeter guys tried to help too much on LeBron/Delly drives to the basket and they made the Celtics pay. Theg also played physically on defense and got the Cs off their rhythm. All of these issues are the same issues the Cs have against Cleveland the last 2 years. Shump and JR especially show us against us. Can't believe Phil Jackson basically gave those guys away. Refs weren't ideal tonight but you can't just blame foul trouble: you have to keep your head level, not give up stupid turnovers, and stay disciplined on defense, and the Cs didn't do that. `\Hope it conveys in this shitty draft class `\oooo kobe!`\JABARI PARK3R`\Barea is so short lol he's 6 ft but man does he look dwarfed`\lol if you actually believe that`\YOOOOOOOOOOO`\Check before you post`\I don't know about you guys, but I only feel comfortable drinking Guinness when I'm know for certain that it's exclusively brewed by Red haired Irish people.

Trust the process.`\Game 5 of the 2014 playoffs in TO there was a very loud mocking Brooklyn chant. I do not recall what happened after that though...`\Bad game, he's usually solid when he plays `\KOBE GETTING DOUBLED THIS IS THE GREATEST MOMENT`\PEPAW FIGHT!!!!  But really, how...awesome? interesting? tragic?....would it be if Vince and Kobe started with the fisticuffs?  `\Almost as the same as that game where the trio of Wiggins, Lavine and KAT had 74 points together. Please, please don't return lou. Just stay on the bench and clap for us the rest of the season.`\Tyreke is loads better than MCW though.`\And hardens teammates make everything...`\Budinger was nice today, but that is a bit of an anomaly

I love Jordan Hill off the bench as well`\It would be amazing since this sub has been against the heat when LeBron was there.`\MWP in so Orlando can get some freebies at the line. Great move by Byron Scott.`\He's does that shit all the time`\BREAK KAT'S RECORD`\Lebron is a game changer, I do agree people forget how to play when he is on the court, it is crazy.`\Playing with Bron must be so fucking nice. Just get open and he will find you.`\No they've actually won those before.`\Plz stop with these Hibbert post ups..`\i really hope cp3 makes the conference finals, he's too good to not have got out of the 2nd round.
`\Should I drink or smoke tonight?`\What the fuck is going on lol`\I doubt either gets traded but nothing would surprise me. One thing that I would like to see before the playoffs start is bring one of them off the bench. Maybe Kyrie as a Jamal Crawford-type`\I wish. Plenty of basketball left, no lead is safe against LeBron.`\lol rambis`\GET ZELLER OUT OF THE GAME`\WE FOUND OUR STARTING PG FOR NEXT SEASON

^^and ^^it's ^^Mike ^^Conley`\We got Steve Nash out here!`\What are you talking about?`\i dont want to hear anything about refs after we got ROBBED in last celts game w the BS call against JR. NBA even admitted it was wrong call.`\Guess it takes a lot more coordination to catch the ball in air. He just bobbled an oop earlier`\Lebron is going to kill these guys by the time playoffs come around.`\Tbh the Knicks as a whole have been rather lifeless since Melo rolled his ankle on that fucking ref. `\Lol the Cavs just lost to a starting lineup of PJ Hairston, JaMychal Green, Ryan Hollins, Tony Allen, and Mario Chalmers, with Lance Stephenson and 40 yr old Vince Carter off the bench.`\How's a regular season game against the Grizzlies a big game?`\I take a shower and we're down by 18.... okay.`\lol You do bring up a good point`\I'd love to see the 1st Quarter Celtics play the 2nd Quarter Cavs. Is that too much to hope for from the second half?`\by....?`\Lakers beat the warriors and fucked the whole league up`\We don't have to talk about this`\GOAT KELLY TANK`\fantastic play out of the time out.

fun game!!!!`\wtf is ryan hollins doing, i cant watch this shit`\BRANDON BASS HUSTLIN`\Tariq Blaq in the house`\Delly is pretty damn easy to root against tho.`\I didn't watch him much but I assume so.

Now doesn't matter though`\I rlly hope Dirk's not off tonight`\You know, I was a skeptic before, but I'm really starting to come around now on the merits of the "Rest your best player" strategy.`\Started bad and real injured but since the ASG we look like one of the best teams in the East.

But regardless, the east isn't winning this year`\Love with 23 points, Kyrie is 23 years old, LeBron is number 23.

He's learning to be that 3&D guy who can also attack the rim, hes only 23, he has got plenty of time.`\Not sleeping, but his defense is atrocious. Oladipo outplayed him tonight`\I love K Love, I don't care what anybody says. `\Eh I'll take it, could have been better after that nice run but could have been much worse after being down 20`\Oh boy`\It will be offensive.`\yuuuuuuuuuuup`\Take that beautiful man out of the game SHITMAN `\i wouldn't call jack n the box tacos a mexican treat lol`\Yeah I was just always blinded by my hate for him. `\I'm literally orgasming imagining this. `\If the Lakers lose by 60, that would have matched the former New Orleans Hornets worst loss in a playoff game against the Denver Nuggets years ago.`\Spurs could use him`\Should be flagrant`\You could have posted this thread 8 minutes into the 3rd quarter`\jfc, that randle jam`\Wow`\Have faith in Lance`\mavs allergic to rebounds or something?`\lmao JR Swissssssshh`\That the organization matter, hell yeh I believe this.`\Tarik in, we bout to get the Nugs in the bonus`\You know it`\If I had to choose between sleep and this game, I would choose sleep.`\I am.

Note: Data from basketball-reference, March 25th.
>> `\To be fair they are playing a bunch of guys that aren't used to 30+ minutes a game tonight.`\> Love the rookie getting into his stride

sick hidden burn`\Not the finals teams `\The NBA is fucking awesome God damn it guys basketball is the shit `\Just as bad as the delusional fans that think this team is going somewhere

 there is no excusing the two highest paid players only scoring 11 points between the two of them `\Aiight i gotta see this lol`\ugh hibbert`\Shumpert is such a bad shooter`\Lol hope they had a camera that caught the Lebron dance away from the refs.`\Mavs were down nearly 20 points twice. Somehow are back in it again. `\4th Quarter was reason they lost. Even LeBron had 0pt in 4th quarter (but only played last 5mins).`\Damn..... that looked good. GG Grizz`\It could be, but to be fair, Wes Johnson is the perfect candidate to be a Doc 3 it seems.`\lol`\how did you make it this far in life without crying jordan?`\The inevitable sex scene is gonna be rad thou `\Love it `\Just telling you to make a more relevant joke. I'm trying to help you. GG and goodnight man.`\I know Gil is still persona non grata, but its nice to see him on a Wiz broadcast`\How was this a big game. `\I hope we can keep this game competitive. I'm conflicted about the tank. I don't really care for the Cavs as a team but Dan Gilbert can go screw himself.`\randle finna be an all star namsayin`\Even the song is old school`\Lebron remaining unlikeable as ever. This moment is about Kobe, not you.`\Is that MJ ?

I don't get it`\Show him on the basketball `\When did the Lakers call in circus clowns to play for them?  Oh wait that's Huertas`\Lebron and CP3 looked like they were discussing last night while watching the  FTs.

"Can you believe they charged us for the wrong bottle of wine?"

"IKR"`\Mickey would be a waaayy better mascot than that stupid bird`\No Conley.

~~No Grindfather.~~ GRINDFATHER IS IN

No ZBO.

No Barnes

No Wright. No Wrong.

No Gasol.

The Grindhouse is grinded down to the bits and pieces. Yet even Adam was created from dust.

Mario Chalmers//Lance Stephenson//~~Matt Barnes~~//JaMychal Green//~~Zach Randolph~~ Era begins!`\At the game, just finished first q. Cavs are dominating the offensive glass but everyone on both teams is drilling jumpers. Feels like a higher scoring 110-100 kinda game `\Are these comments not showing up for anyone else?`\YOU'RE UNBEARABLE!!!`\ouch`\I'll finish it for him ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)`\Man, put Kobe back in Byron. Who cares if he has a game in two days. Let him play.`\So many people shitting on a good performance just because it was against a bad team. 39 points is nothing to scoff about, never did I say it meant he was great so stop trying to conjecture. `\If ya'll were in the east i think shit changes dramatically from 09-16.. Would have had some great series with the baby bulls lebrons cavs p.d & a.d , celtics old four + doc , the heatles, `\That was a fun game.`\This is what 5 games in 7 days do to a team`\good thing they're still young as fuck and nowhere near their primes(except jr)`\"You watch *The Starters*, Kevin?"

"..Yes. Yes. Uh-huh."

lmao that man has never watched the show`\Question to Cavs fans: Tristan's statline of 8.1PPG and 9.5RPG worth his contract? Yay or nay? `\Channing has been an absolute beast since he's gotten here`\JR giveth and JR taketh `\Vic doing everything he can to keep us in the game.`\Memories!`\They got swept last year because they played a demonstrably better team. `\23-26? `\GG`\Grizzlies over 100? Tony Allen with 26?

Is this some alternate timeline?`\Is that Nashville hot chicken any good?  ANyone tried it?`\BRB.

wait how do i get ass cancer. Smoke cigs backwards?`\I hate Lebron for many reasons`\She's hot af tho`\Ye and Bogut on the Dubs`\this one's for you Odom ��`\They can't acknowledge it though. He's going to get a nameless gold plaque in the basement of some Buss-owned property like they do in the CIA in movies for undercover agents killed in action. `\Love's RPM is top 20 in the NBA. In no universe ever was Ilgauskas on that level.`\That's why he made sure to get an 11th`\Or, there are a ton of complexities to the game of basketball in late game situations and luck and execution are both components of that equation. `\I love you Vince.  So much.`\Thats what you get for not being an LA Kings fan`\Tucker dunked on Lou Will in transition*`\Danny Green bro.  Not everybody figures it out right away!  I hope he's the case lol.  `\Give me hope as a 31 year old`\i never thought id say this but...wheres roy lol`\Unfortunately, he hung on the rim 5 minutes longer than he needed to.`\Tony Allen and Lance "Make em Dance" Stephenson makes me love this team`\let's go bucks!`\He has to be starting, our bench is like 2 players with all the injuries we have lol.`\How many rings do the Cavs have? `\Thats funny.  His all-nba year last year was better than any year in wall or dames career.  And he did it at 22 years old.   When hes not coming off a serious injury, hes obviously a better, more efficient scorer than lillard.  Obviously not the playmaker wall is, but being a "playmaker" has never really helped the wizards offense be anywhere above average.`\+1 for the edit... `\yeah, he didn't always shoot them like that, and he used to be better`\Anyone willing to take Lou for a bag of peanut M&M's?`\Too much shit-posting inside perhaps. It was pretty funny though.`\I think 1/4 went to the Cavs with Lebron then the leftovers went to Ws. But now your team has at least 1/4 former Heat fans and g-d knows how many extra bandwagoners, but same can be said for Ws and any team that wins a lot. I just think you two got extra fans than normal from the Heat. `\He's in the East, and he literally hand-picked his team. It's gonna be tough for him to beat the historic 44-20 Raptors this season.`\Yeah he's been the consensus #2 since the beginning of the year. The competition , if there even was any , has not progressed or even dropped off except for Hield. He still is raw though. Like KD (not in terms of quality) he is yet to make use of his length and wingspan and use it to be a consistent shooter`\That makes sense. I was at the game so I saw it from the side at basically eye level and it was hard to tell just how far away from him Delly was. `\Earl Watson needs to be fired tomorrow. Actively hurting the Suns for some bullshit temporary warm feelings. `\Holy fuck Lebron`\kobe's smile making me happy`\He does know were gonna lose right?`\will feel good when mickey plays for zeller`\Offense stagnates further having Lou out there. `\We'll be fine. `\Wouldn't be a big enough sample size lol`\That's a pretty mean way of putting it but I don't get the appeal either.`\Guys please bless me with a stream. `\Go back to watching the fucking heat.`\Lol we've missed like 7 open 3s`\I saw 2 episodes so far, it's goods.`\Well, here on the /r/NBA sub we talk things up only and ONLY based on the current game.

Tristan Thompson is a great player with a great stat line who is worth his value in today's NBA considering his value to the team. Here.

Now, let's wait until tomorrow when TT will proceed to gather a solid 2/2/2 in 22 stat line, then we can state a very obvious fact that TT does not have place in today's NBA, and actually, basketball as a whole.`\yup
`\Got his just desserts after those hacks on Lopez last time.`\With no one of any merit playing. Big accomplishment.`\I'm not saying Lue should be the guy over Blatt, I'm still on the fence about it. But LBJ was not our problem tonight, everyone else way, along with how well we let you guys shoot from three. `\Cavs played like butt`\100 key banana? I'm confused `\Nice 'the watcher' instrumental`\Always is.`\that was a 2 by illy`\Hes an extremely efficient scorer.    The number of ways he can score the ball at 24 years and 1 day of age is really special.`\i told cuban no..`\These Suns starters LOL`\WADE!`\GODDAMN NANCE, shame about the shit call.

Definitely has dad's legs.`\Grizzlies are actually running post-up plays for Tony. What is this world`\https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/42b97k/kristaps_porzingis_417_2_turnovers_in_27_minutes/`\Fair enough, each to their own`\Oh :(`\better make espn not so top 10`\I wish he'd stop that shit with as much as it's come back to bite us this season.`\Nah, that doesn't matter. It's usually high then low score, but it should definitely match the order in the sentence, cavs defeat wizards 108 to 83.`\That boy needs therapy.`\Who has a question?  `\Cmon Kobes `\He's at the salon getting a perm `\would you rather listen to him, or his brother Jon Barry ? `\No Tacos for you :D`\Bruin vs Bruin action :D `\well i agree on this one.`\Wes stop taking 3's unless ur **wide** open in the corner and even then try to pass first please, ty`\It's the reverse for Russell for me. lol Anytime I see Russell down and in pain, I assume it's not really serious, and he'll be back in 1-2 game(s)`\Knight is tha truth`\We gotta stop these offensive rebounds..`\JC loves that freethrow jumper...i love using it in pickup too, it goes down more often than not`\Yeah, that's true. Might just be a rough couple years to be a mavs fan`\Booker's hitting the wall hard.. so it's still up in the air for him.`\Matt Barnes disappeared more than Jamal. `\SULLY COAST TO COAST!`\did you start that? i freaking love it`\He's had two all star years.

It was mainly because he was a beast in the 2013 ECF`\Well that de-escalated ^quickly`\Thanks magic`\This jump roping is fucking lit`\Yeah, it's effective, but I feel like it's not the best for team chemistry. Might me just overthinking it because this game is close`\Wade dancing on delly o baby !!!`\How are cavs getting dumpstered by the Grizzlies B team`\Agreed. For the first time in awhile, it looked like they were having fun out there. Big W.`\ic kurt got him some chicken noodle soup`\Yes. He practically does what kevin Love has been doing for much cheaper. Ditching love for better Role Players would be a much better idea`\lol damn `\Dirk fader at 20`\THANK YOU. Someone gets it.`\LeBron should just go bald. Plenty of the GOATS  did it. MJ, Kobe, Ray. Just do it LeBron  `\I don't think they are using him in that way. Strictly defense`\50 losses too late`\Whiteside said he wants to stay and like I said we have Josh Richardson, Winslow, and Tyler Johnson as good prospects plus we can get better free agents than Boston.`\IMO, there'll never be a time when players like DJ or Shaq don't "make the cut". They'll always have value that outweighs their FT shooting.`\I was there and during the warmups you could just see these guys didn't give a single fuck tonight. Julius Randle, whose jersey I was wearing like an asshole, gave the most uninspired performance since [this fucking kid](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aTdu9HFqvM). The only time I saw effort from a player in a Lakers jersey was when Kobe got pissed and guarded Hood after Hood's 8th three/Kobe's airball (which was a knife in the heart of ever Lakers fan in the building). That was the one positive memory I'll take from that shit show. Kobe giving 100% on D and shutting down Utah's hardest player while every other Laker just sat around and waited for the clock to expire. `\The fuck are you doing Mavs. `\suprisingly hype game`\You didn't see him against the Bulls a month or so ago`\This is like the all-American game LOL`\otto and temple you mean?`\Well, not to be an obvious homer, but I see Byron's rotations and it is SO obvious he's not putting units out on the floor to win.

Sometimes he does, like in the Warriors game, just to see what we can do.

But most of the time it's a Huertas and Ryan Kelly shit sandwich. `\loving the Kobe vs. LeBorn matchup`\Kobe vs Lebron never disappoints. I wish Kobe would just sign 1 day contracts in the future just so we can continue seeing these games. `\[D'Angelo Russell, Julius Randle and Jordan Clarkson combine for 74 points.](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-j8L71y41jN4/Tz5ng7PsZDI/AAAAAAAAAR4/eyPSPc_q6HQ/s1600/future-rapper-laughing-2.jpg) `\Please 6ers, I'm rooting for you! (Sorry Orlando, but want the pick)`\MOTHAFUCKIN DLO!`\Exactly what I was thinking`\#LANCE YOU SASSY ASS MUTHA FUCKA`\washington commentators sound salty, let it go lmao`\"Huertas Among the Trees" coming to theaters July 2017`\Huertas a lock for ROTY?`\les go lakers`\knicks and nets have the best local announcers by a mile....maybe lakers are close`\get in line`\I wish Vince Carter was my dad `\Huertas should be a future Dos Equis man.`\Cause they forced a bad shot?`\Keep sweatin', OKC.`\Nujabes has a ring? Wow nice. Do an AMA. `\Yeah shin contusion`\Best backcourt in the NBA so far this week. `\Wouldn't this just make Steph Curry and Lebron that much harder to guard though? `\Lee's defense is terrible actually`\LeBron with 8/4/6 1st quarter...`\2nd half of b2b and they've both played huge minutes lately. I think they'll both play 20ish minutes of 2nd half though.`\ARE YOU KIDDING ME?`\Go away, we need this loss too.`\Thank you Miami! `\to be fair Mavs fans have been complaining about that three guard lineup for a while`\Cleveland is hitting everything from three. Fucking Channing frye`\Cavs don't stand a chance against GS, if they make it to The Finals.`\Cavs have the rare home for 2x games back to back.`\Boston gets lucky with the Brooklyn pick and they become a big threat. Brad Stevens is a perfect coach for a young team with a chip on their shoulder. Plus he's a smart man for marrying a woman from NE Ohio (edit: I just realized every Boston head coach in the 3 major sports is connected to Cleveland).

But when the Cavs move the rock and get everyone involved they are tough to handle. They need to keep realizing how good they've been when they rack up the assists...also nice to see LBJ at the 4 is coming back with the playoffs on the horizon.`\Let's go Lakers`\OH FUCK!`\> Goran fail a dunk attempt

And still make the shot!`\jesus jordan`\It feels so good to watch entertaining Lakers basketball these past few games. `\THE LOGO IS FUCKIN WET`\Honestly that sounds like piped noise.`\Kill me now.`\Brandon Bass is a fucking *PRO.*`\But others lack this ability? `\Legend has it, Channing's wrist is magic.`\We need to put KP in some pick and roll/pops. The offense is way too stagnant.`\ITT: People thinking this game justifies TT's awful contract`\Yes, yes we did. I'm here to get laughed at. `\I.T.S T.H.E N.E.T.S`\Nah, their coach is trash. Lakers have 2 young players literally better than anyone on the Suns. `\CARM3LO`\This may be the funniest thing I've seen all year in the NBA`\JJ jon jj gn`\Wasn't it both?`\LeBron, you son of a bitch, if you don't get this trip dub...`\Why not just actually shoot it Huertas you had it`\Oh god that commercial is gold. `\Is that stat right? Jeff Ayres is 100% FG this season as a Clipper`\I've seen crying jordan I just thought this was some new meme I wasn't aware of, but it just clicked `\#We coming for dat Championship`\No no, I insist, you take Ingram, we'll take that pesky Ben off of your hands.`\Just like we all predicted `\Just because they call it doesn't mean it's not wrong ;) Notice how when ET just did it on the box he went towards the basket? Yeah. `\Thank you. Much appreciated. `\Cavs did that a couple days ago psh. God damn trail blazers`\RIP TACOS`\Its Harry canary, Yao flamingo, and Shaquille o'seal`\KING HIM`\FUCK`\Were all getting Cancer for watching this `\I really loathe Mirza right now. His heat seeking treys are anti-tank missiles doing irreparable damage`\Channing is on Fryer!

I'll leave. `\byron not even trying to disguise the tank anymore`\For real. I've been waiting for them to start clicking a bit better all year. Give it 1, maybe 2 more seasons, we're back on top. Kobe's retirement this year really hurts, I've literally watched the man play since I was 6 years old, but the future is so goddamn bright.`\Definitely not I was just saying those rebounds after some if the comments earlier. Not watching just reading play by play also which can be misleading.`\Career high, good for him`\That's our game plan every game! it was a good game, I completely agree about the refs, no calls seemed to go our way until the last five minutes and then everything did. See you in the finals!`\It can only get better from here... if he ever watches another`\Holy fuck. That is crazy.

Off the left foot, grabbed it with his left hand and could still elevate, adjust and throw it down. Fucking ridiculous.`\Vintage Kobe right there.`\Except, IDK, MWP elbowing Humphries in the throat?`\Mudiay is leading him in every advanced defensive stat`\We're actually gonna win this. fml`\Love didn't start falling before the contact.

`\Gladly <3`\Despite the popular narrative about team chemistry, the cavs had a lot of positive energy and hype in crunch time in this game. When Love hit that 4 point play I got chills seeing the whole team hyped with him. Hopefully it's a trend that continues.`\No hawks, hornets, or heat fans in here celebrating? What's the deal?`\* Randle with 23/11 on 61.7 TS%
* Russell with 27/2/3/3 on 65 TS%
* Clarkson with 24/5/3 on 68.8 TS%
* Nance Jr. with 8/10 in 20 minutes

In the words of Stu Lantz: NOICE.`\Someone in game thread said, *"This was like watching Kobe take over a game."* Yeah I have to agree. He was cold and calculating tonight, and what he did at the end was remarkable for a rookie.
`\I didn't either`\Will the plucky upstarts take out the juggernaut behemoth?

Stay tuned!`\Give me back my Bosh and let us meet LeBron and co in the playoffs.

Will there ever be better days for this team?`\Two sets of rules`\Paul Millsap everyone`\Yeah but now we're going to end up with the fourth or fifth worst record instead of the third.

Worthless player and waste of a pick `\Simmons tweeted a while back like last year that any player who retired with similar career numbers as ZBo has made it to the HoF. I'm not gonna comment on whether or not I think he'll make it. But you are guaranteeing that Randle will have a better career than players who have made the HoF. Off one year of play.

Could be because of the huge amounts of playing time given to Lou, Kelly, MWP and Huertas (I'm actually fine with Huertas, as crazy as that sounds, to have at least 15 minutes per game), but yeah, the starters were pretty disconnected. We couldn't hit threes properly, even Clarkson missed shots he makes.`\Vince was 04-05, non-finals team.

`\That's why the Lakers pay Ryan Kelly the big bucks.`\TT already helping more on Redick than Moz, not a great sign for him =[`\.. still trying to find the /s.

Jk lol

But imo he looks so sloppy dribbling the ball. I cringe when I see him or TA handling the ball`\"I wish I had more hands, so I could give those titties 4 thumbs down"`\You can't even sit here and fucking say that after our last matchup. You guys were **literally** handed that game.`\As a tortured Cleveland fan, I would throw 5 mil at a waterboy if his towel-bringing and water bottle-handing in any improved our chances of winning a title. Thompson is an integral part of the team and replacing him would've been nearly impossible so if Gilbert is willing to pay, the amount of the contract is trivial.  `\2-5-5 for Randle.

I love this team

TONY IS A GOD!`\Well I mean at this point he's being held together with duct tape and gorilla glue he's just trying to enjoy his last season `\Actually didn't Byron Scott advocate for drafting D'angelo? Mitch wanted Okafor`\well since no one can see our comments.. CAVS SUCK ASS ahahaha`\He had more strength. He's not gained enough quickness and agility to make up for it, and he sorta looks like a stupid small forward with a decent hook since.`\the other team has to miss for players to get rebounds`\what the fuck`\[That Mack/Exum/Neto Line-Up](http://i.imgur.com/qrVe95w.png)`\What a pass by Kyrie`\Ian Eagle is the fucking man.

His selfishness is absurd.`\I don't watch much Lakers games but Clarkson and Kobe are holding D'Angelo back. Russell is defereing to Kobe to much for a contested fadaway and once Clarkson gets the ball it's not leaving his hands.

It's incredibly frustrating to watch us dick around for 3 quarters and then get serious in the 4th. One of our biggest criticisms is that we can't destroy anyone, and it pisses me off because I know we could if we just tried.`\Whoo! I'm here at the Staples for my first NBA game!`\  Running fine for me. `\if these refs were halfway competent the grizz are up by 30.

Man, i had such high hopes for Ryan Kelly to be a capable strech 4, a guy that comes off the bench and produces good (kinda like what Draymond Green does, he has/had the skillset), but i think Byron benching him for the whole of last season just made it worse for his development.`\Its a win, no one cares. `\If Shumpert starts who do the cavs have off the bench as far as guards, Delly and Jefferson?`\We are now a three point shooting team that is very inconsistent in 3 point shooting.`\LMAO HE MISSED `\Then hurry up and win more games, haha...don't need anymore of this season's physical strain on my heart.`\I don't get why people are saying fucked up stuff to me.

I just can't get enough of this game`\Humphries is gonna foul out, just to hack-a-jordan`\Nah. We had better teams than MJ. He had like three big plays against us.

Certainly has the vision.`\Cole all I do is baldrich is looking great tonight`\LETS GO RANDLE`\Nah man. That was Russell's third strong game in a row, and tonight makes 4.

Mudiay did look good tonight. He will be good. No need to hate on Russell to make yourself feel better. Human nature: arguing fervently tends to strengthen your belief in your position even in the face of overwhelming opposing evidence. Your comments make you look like you're just deepening you errant position on Russell vs Mudiay. Just admit you made a mistake and move on. You'll have less cognitive dissonance. `\"" ball doesn't lie.'

What you doing`\im saying it here now the heat are making to the finals especially with the help of our lord almighty joe jesus`\Marcelo gets to fancy at times.`\I think Nance Jr. off the bench is much better.

I'm done counting the losses. I've been counting the progression in stats instead. If they go on a win streak to end the season because Russell starts dominating, would you be mad? Don't you see the flaw in that logic. If any of our young guys dominate to the point that they can win games surrounded by shitty teammates, that should have you excited for the future. Not worried about the draft.`\Lol kyrie had 8 assists last game but nets announcers already talking shit.`\You are absolutely right, we are way too fragile after the half with a big lead`\Okay so I've been curious about this for a while, but does Richard Jefferson really have his initials tattooed on him? `\If we could just stop making Randle create for himself, that would be great`\Huertas with the clutch pass to the Suns`\Let's not discount the defensive showcase put on by the Grizz. Every time a cav player drove they were surrounded by defense and couldn't even pass the ball. It's not like the Grizz shot lights out they just played a great defensive game`\Damn, forgot Matt Barnes played for the suns.

EDIT: Matt Barnes was also drafted by the Grizzlies and traded to the Cavs, a perfect homecoming tbh.`\Really went up against murderers row tonight. Not saying he is a bust but going off against brooklyn isn't some feat that makes you a great player.`\��`\we are beyond terrible`\no its doesnt

A lot of chemistry when we have a real team.`\its not obvious?`\Rare win for my Cavs scarf tonight. `\At least most of the old guys will be gone next year.

Besides Kobe retiring, Hibbert, MWP, Kelly, Sacre, Huertas, are all on expiring contracts. I don't want any of them back. Bass will hopefully not pick up his player option and we'll have a lot more playing time for the young guys.`\lol fuck this team `\Dang Jam must have knees like KG has elbows`\The problem is the talent pool in the NBA draft.  There's too much of a drop off between the top 5 and top 15 picks in the draft so there's incentive to be really bad if you aren't good.  Change the lottery and you remove the advantages of tanking.  Even good teams will tank if they experience major injuries rather than try to sneak into the playoffs in occasion (See:1996 Spurs).  `\Hope no one got peed on.`\But it's actual basketball knowledge and not rants about whatever is on Van Gundy's mind that day.  Still, I agree lol`\Because the 3 seed is probably going to play Portland, and nobody wants to play them in the playoffs.

This is why I laugh when people say Curry and the Warriors wouldn't be able to dominate any other era. Last time I checked, you couldn't double in that era so a player like Barkley isn't going to be able guard Steph unless you want to leave your point guard on Klay or Barnes.

Also, hand checking isn't going to stop a player from shooting 35 footers or making you look silly on a cross over. Try to reach in on Curry or bump him and he's going to go right around you and because of the rules; you're not going to have a teammate within the vicinity to challenge his shot. `\We've always been a high volume 3pt team. `\You a *genius*.`\good game so far.`\I don't give a shit how it ended.

Really?`\Uh-oh, stream bout to be shaky all night`\The one encouraging thing is his height and length will make it a lot easier for him to develop a defensive game than other guys.

Shit, I wish. He plays like he has NO hands. If he's not leading the league in missed dunks and fumbled passes I would be shocked. Love the guy but holy hell he can't hold onto a ball. `\I can't stand Randle, the guy doesn't ever pass the ball. Seems like he has zero BBall IQ. `\Cavs need to trade one of either Love or Irving.

`\Dat ass`\who is the color guy with Harlan?`\dem tears tho`\We have been the #1 team in the NBA at generating open looks and one of the worst in the NBA at knocking them down so far.

Damn amazing what he can do once our guys decide to actually move around.`\Omer needs some of that Stickum`\Knew this would be the first comment, not disappointed `\He is overpaid but the cavs needed to overpay him so in that sense it is okay. Without Tristan Thompson this team would not be as good as they are, they had no replacements.`\Riding the Clippers collective ass just feels right....:)`\I like this Ray guy.  Did we get rid of the other D league guy?  Alex?  Or are we "deep" enough to not play every single healthy player?  He's not injured is he?`\Has Lebron abaandoned the headband fulltime?`\So is their plan to just watch the Cavs run up and score layups, but also never cover the hot 3 pt shooter?`\KOBEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE`\Yeah. Pretty much.

Just more shots = more data points = variance should level out. So a team shooting a bit worse than normal to start v. a team shooting a bit better than normal to start could = a 2-20 lead. But as the game progesses and the players starting hitting their normal shots or a bit better it could even out.

So later in the game, variance should be smoother, so the lead is more likely a product of the team just being better.

Not perfect though because it's not the same 5v5 the whole game.
`\Literally like 3 possessions`\How these teams have fallen...`\COME FUCKING ON FUCK

Casspi, that guy on the Kings blew by him easily a few times back when they played and Kyrie continuously struggled with him. It's dumbfounding how bad he is defensively, maybe he's purposely giving them the lane and hoping his help D bails him out? `\Gasol's out for the season; Brandan Wright is out "indefinitely", might be back in a few weeks, but there's no timetable; Chris Andersen should be back soon; Conley as well; Chalmers, you saw what happened to him, if his achilles is torn he obviously won't be back.`\Lol...that's perfect.

`\Their young core is pretty meh compared to other young teams. `\DLo is the most improved rookie.`\To be fair that worked mostly because he was nursing an injured hamstring.

He just doesn't have a body that can handle the best centers and power forwards in the world.  He's too weak to be a really effective center, and too clunky to be a really effective PF.  Once teams started getting up close to him, he's been neutralized pretty effectively.  He'll try some shaking around to get the defender off him a bit, but he can't push.  And some of his long distance shots where he's been open, he's struggled.  He's also played more than he ever did in Spain.  Next year, I think he'll be far better, he really is a project, just an "overachieving" project.  `\is wall the only wizard player that gives a shit??`\I disagree about Clarkson.

`\So Kyrie got 2+1 and Bradley a charge for the same play. jesus, you make me bitch like LeBron refs`\He's being overpaid but it's completely irrelevant to our team. We can't add free agents because LeBron will get 35% of the cap every single year even with the cap increasing and Love/Kyrie will always put us over the cap. The only thing TT effects is our owner's pocket. People need to stop worrying about the billionaires and worry about the entertainers.`\ISAIAH! THE LITTLE MAN!`\Waxed you guys twice this year

I hope we can keep it close, but I have very little confidence...but miracles happen, or so someone in LA told me the other day.`\These announcers are awful. Totally biased towards the Cs`\"now we just put our hand in the next guy's pocket"`\If it doesn't get removed I would. I don't care. My initial point was with their main guy out he should step up not post 2-2-2. 14&11 is good but that even during a game without LeBron is meh.

Okay, you've got Brandon Bass on you. That's the best time to run a big/little pick and roll, because you're either going to have Bass try to navigate a screen, or you're going to have someone smaller guarding you. Shutting down to iso basically turns you into a 1 on 5 situation, because nobody is playing the jumpshot. I'd bet that there were 3 or 4 Lakers in the paint when he took that shot.`\*Ignition by R.

Either by going to the free throw line or by being on the Spurs.`\Finally someone contests JR so he can knock a 3 down.  `\he took one and nothing happened`\Got hit hard by a wall. `\It's a shame cause I feel like several east teams match up better with the west contenders (e.g. raptors, Celtics, Hawks) than the cavs do, but it's still far more likely that the cavs make it out of the east only to get smacked. `\Huertas on James some how worked hahahahahahaha`\What a move Wade`\That was my pre-season prediction!
`\wiz aint making it`\I'm so damn conflicted right now`\Bulls can only upset their fans just as during past couple of years :^)`\Thoughts:

Cavs were ice cold from behind the line. Seems like everyone is in a funk right now.

Carlisle showed why he's one of the best coaches in the league in the 4th quarter. Smart decision to run zone and go tall ball.

4th quarter really showed why LeBron is very much needed on this team. Kyrie was doing way too much in the 4th and our offense went stagnant. Maybe we just got complacent but who knows.

Personally, the Kyrie steal at the end could have been called either way. Looked like Kyrie made some contact, but Dirk seemed to fall back pretty easily.

A win is a win though, nice to see us beat a playoff team without LeBron. Hopefully next time it's a more consistent performance, although we did lead the entire game. Good game Mavs`\How was that offensive`\wait ... who killed the narrative about lebron making his teammates better?`\Pretty much. `\Worth every penny

In hindsight, I don't mind. But FUUUUCK I WANT SIMMONS. The story is too cute. Him and Dlo were homies in high school `\Kyrie needs to take notes.

Wait........`\corner pipe`\Kobe's like: "holy shit Roy you're worse than Kwame"`\it sure did`\TV ratings are down last year and this year, so people are starting to tune out, but they still sell 99% of tickets and a the ratings are still good overall.`\was like a memo went off in his head "shump you needa get in on these highlights"`\What's it say about Jeff Green when I totally forgot he played for the Clippers now?`\My god`\Because it isnt a Warriors game thread`\Martin killin it`\Sure, but where is the team being blamed in their comment? Also a ref is specifically singled out. `\The Cavs get a whistle everytime they go to the hoop, whether there is any contact or not.  How do they ever lose?`\Lopez could potentially be the best Net ever`\LMAO. there's a reason why i said "big game" keep telling yourself whatever makes you feel better from losing everyday buddy`\why do u hate us`\Are they playing Zelda? `\Anyone got streamable? I'm done with Twitter videos as a mobile user.`\Towns is not even top 25 I hope you are joking. He's still a rookie but he does have potential to be great. Unless he turns out to be Tyreke Evans 2.0 and never replicates or builds off of a successful rookie year `\She's the only redeeming part of the pre show`\We're not really playing poorly but we're not hitting our open looks. That LeBron layup miss leading to the Redick 3 (after a blatant travel) is the epitome of this game so far`\Kyrie Irving`\I didn't know Whitey from 8 Crazy Nights was reffing the NBA now `\this officiating is a fucking joke on both sides. everyone has legit gripes.`\Winslow plays defense like a fucking nfl corner`\I just saw more defense from Simba and Salah in one play then from the entire three PG line up. `\am i seeing streamers?`\Meth isn't really considered a PED. `\>Fuck LeBron

 -Mario Chalmers `\Seems like he's planning on spending most of this last quarter of the regular season in the air. `\Austin Carr makes me laugh lol`\can we not make layups and dunks anymore???`\So... Does that count as a turnover? Tip-off straight out of bounds? I guess not 'cause no team ever had possession. `\If the Cavs can play K. Love at center versus you... it's not going to turn out well. `\Cavs whole team bitches about fouls. `\What the fuck`\My stomach hurts.`\10 ppg and a couple of assists from your backup point guard isn't too bad`\Raptors lost at home also to the Rockets lol`\Damn Reddick and CP3 with their shooting`\dude his passes are gorgeous `\Thanks buddy!

It's not even that people who say it are bad people.  They just do not understand sometimes the culture that their language inhibits.  If we can educate people and spread awareness to social issues to help make the world a better place just one day at a time-we are doing something right. `\But when I think of best player in the NBA. I think, who is currently playing the best. Potential doesn't matter if you aren't performing like the best`\The fans don't pay his contact especially when ticket prices didn't really raise this year.`\Imagine him with the likes of Horford and Millsap inside, or DeRozan playing the 2 with him, and so on... he deserves much more, and we're only gonna realize that 100% when he leaves and explodes the statlines`\Channing Frye you legend`\holy shit thanks la`\Does a miss and a foul count as a shot miss?`\Yeah that was a weird comment. If someone didn't know Kobe was extremely intelligent, it's because he never heard him talk or just wasn't paying attention at all.

Man that was sick. If only he finished that`\I think he is, because he's a much better team defender, and he can guard more positions on the court. Being able to switch onto players is a really underrated skill that people don't think about enough when thinking about defense, and Crowder can guard 4 positions whereas Bradley can really only guard 1, add in Crowder's ability as an above average rebounder and I think he's a much better defensive player.

Also, Avery Bradley's defense can be a little bit fluky, people laud his 1v1 defense, but that isn't all there is to defense, and his #'s are pretty questionable, he's a pretty significant negative in Defensive RPM, and the Celtics defensive rating is 6 points per 100 possessions better when he's off the court rather than on it. `\tell that to JR `\It's not close, but if Scal were being compared to the rest of the league without Tommy he'd rank near the top, along with the guys commentating the other side in this game.`\Active hands early on`\Lelbron season approachin `\nice `\Ryan Kelly getting an equity stake in the team after his tank job tonight`\Lakers are good at scoring off of .4s. `\The tank is so strong they forget about us`\lmao poor Thad Young`\welp...

Hes a much more one-dimensional player than kyrie but so much more frustrating because of his physical gifts.  He cant pass, he cant rebound, hes not a great defender and hes an inefficient scorer on a very high usage.     He definitely has some cool dunks, but i dont reallt see the "special".`\What did I just watch?`\Swished a three pointer too!

Fuck what the haters say`\We could definitely be more physical.`\I think it's because he gets tired.  LeBron wanted to go lean to avoid this but his size is essential to his game. `\Holy shit.

I'm super excited to watch all those players grow up.

Don't get me wrong, Lebron is a great player and still enjoy watching him play, but he can stay in Cleveland.

I can think of no other similarities`\oh hell yes`\People keep asking why I'm down on the cavs, even as a cavs fan. I explain it pretty simply. It's not that I don't think they CAN win. It's that they haven't been PLAYING like they can win. I think they can turn it on for the playoffs, which is weird given how many guys are not playoff vets... But I need to see it before I believe in them blindly. There have been a lot of problems with the teams play, but the personnel has the potential.

Hibbert also had one of his best games, probably one of my favorites to watch this season`\Wow I got down voted for this.  Every Laker's fan I know (and there are a lot, I live in Phoenix) admits that the worst part about Kobe Bryant was how much a whiny ass he was when his team wasn't winning.`\Every time we go to Miami. Every. Time `\Don't know why anyone's surprised at the score. We could play a middle school team and we'd let them stay in the game
`\That sounds delicious...`\He doesn't even have a basic back to the basket repertoire. Needs at least a counter or up and under move`\"Dad, what was it like watching LeBron James play in his prime?" - child

"I don't know son because I was a petty man-child and refused to witness his greatness" - LeBron hater.`\...there is a method to his madness


Plus its not like Dlo can play 48min...chill brotha
`\wait why is he shooting 2?`\FUCK THE CAVS`\He's got that aussieness too, cheeky cunts `\Highlights for the Cavs game the other day were exclusively Cavs.`\Before the game I gave an over/under of 25.5 on how many complaints there would about the Cavs announcers. I thought it was only fair to report that there was only a measly 17.`\huh. It seemed like he had more than that. I guess not. :/`\hey thats our gif`\Pls just let it stop, what in the fucking world goes on in that locker room to make us have such shitty 3rd quarters? I have no more hate just the expectations of a 3rd  quarter fallout `\RJ getting his own initials tattooed on his arm might be one of most d-bag moves of all-time.`\If it makes you feel better I hope you guys win :)`\Byron's intentions are obvious enough, having chucker Lou and Ryan Kelly.`\WE NEED A KELLY TANK COMMANDER SHOP ASAP.`\"Hes not from this planet, maybe he could materialize here" - Stu lantz talking about Kobe after the chants

Never change Stu`\Mozgov can skip. That surprises me for some reason`\[maybe.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aAOMPumq5w)`\Sorry Clippers fans, rooting for the Nets to take this one because FUCK THE CELTICS! #PUSHTOBEOUTSIDETHETOP5`\He is so damn slow at times like I don't get it. I know you are a big guy but damn he is so slow when it comes to moving and trying to play defense. I just don't understand how he has such little effort on defense. `\lol why are they shitting on cam's hat.. i get it, but still lol`\Ya I think Bron and Curry desensitized us to these nice scoring games, but 40 for a rookie is just bonkers `\They've beaten the Cavs before. Would a loss here really discredit them?`\I miss fat UCLA Kevin Love`\lebron with the deja vu play

`\Would be nice to have a good bench one day`\Two defensive juggernauts in a slug fest.`\He barely gets playing time. Raw at times but plays with a very needed energy and hustle. I like him, he deserves more playing time. `\Wtf grizzlies I thought we were getting your spot, but you didn't get worse.`\Nah I agree. That was a pretty clear "Lebron foul".`\Tossed you a few :D`\That dude can make a three if he wants to. The guy has a good and weird shot.`\HAHAHAH this is awesome`\Cmc with the midair steal/block`\Just keep the ball away from Metta`\Yo just tuned in. How's Kyrie doing?`\Fuck that I'd lawyer up`\Wiggins has been legit awful tonight. That's like the fourth time he's just thrown it directly to the other team`\Sometimes i wonder if those "We want Kobe" chants are inputted from the Staples Arena. Seriously, we've seen him enough, he does not need to go hero ball, and i just want tosee the rookies in there instead.`\UPVOTE EVERY TIME `\Why is there a spoiler tag if the spoiler is in the title?`\Clearly Tony`\Frye was a great pickup.  He has always excelled as a role player on a good team but he can't carry a bad one.  Great fit for Cleveland much like JJ is for us.`\nurk don't give a fuck lol, talking mad shit to the bench`\I think this is a part of his game he's been silently developing throughout the season. He is very adept at running the floor and is learning to pass to the shot, if that makes sense.`\Bench fucked around and cut a 16 point lead LOL`\Lakers improve the Brooklyn pick? My only love sprung from my only hate!`\True.

Still, it ended at the perfect time for them. If he has his jumper going into the playoffs, that makes them even better.`\sort of, the warriors are on top after all.`\memphis playing hard for jeff green

wait`\GOD FUVF(ODSIJHGN


FUCJKPV:KDM

FUCK FUCK FUCK`\this could get ugly`\VC is awesome. Cant believe hes doing this at 39`\He's not worth it, but he had leverage and capitalized. Not much we can do now`\Memphis definitely deserved a couple calls throughout the game, but in the last couple minutes Delly got screwed on two big calls. In the end this really shouldn't have been close anyway so as much as I hate it we deserved to lose.`\Kobe show`\> Wiggens

`\Only 1 assist for Kyrie. Not 4.`\Wars have casualties, as did that series.`\i hate it when the half time isn't about the teams that are actually playing.`\clips may want to get paul pierce off lance

does anyone remember when paul pierce did the splits thanks to a joe johnson move? rofllll`\One of the worst calls of the year`\Jeff green continuing to not be "the missing piece" for every team he goes to`\CALDERON OF ALL PEOPLE LMAO LETS GOOOO`\Thanks ATL for making the game interesting `\aTriple do7ble baby`\It's like Roy Hibbert double-crossed a gypsy and now he only plays well in completely meaningless games.`\Swag`\Well with Blake, one would always be on the court`\But... LeBron and Kyrie have chemistry problems.`\Because you guys paid him $70 million to shoot the ball`\Use it or lose it

Might as well use it`\Joe Johnson is such a beast. Really happy to see him still kicking for you guys.

#PhoenixRefugees`\how many testicles will russell lose this game`\Lebron James as Point Forward to Channing Frye for a three. Yep. That makes sense given its against us.`\God damn Lebron...`\Nicholson going full Leo`\someone needs to toss you off a plane`\did they just show someones AAA card info on cam lol`\Look at it this way- the better we both play, the less of a chance there is we see each other until later in the playoffs :) `\now i see why kobe says tony is his toughest defender. `\Am a Grizz fan. I was confused about that. Was it because delly was jumping for the ball too? `\MARCELO "GOD" HUERTAS`\Find someone who has as much faith in you as Marcus Smart does in his 3 point shot`\Damn Tony Allen getting buckets these days`\I know we've jerked this around almost every night since, but I can't believe we got a first rounder and Lance for Jeff. I loved Jeff (and hated him), but what a steal.`\Oh no it's Marcelo Huertas. WHAT`\*This* is a Cavs team that can give the Warriors a series.`\Gorgui missed a bankshot? wtf`\Great, now send JR to Flint.`\[dirk's in a good mood](https://zippy.gfycat.com/NaturalAffectionateGalapagostortoise.webm)`\Len: 0-5, 0 points

pls put him in the game`\"Kyrie startled when Campy touched his head, he wants out!"`\Tony Allen literally thought he was Kevin Durant for a second `\The pics are clear as day that Kyrie hooked him. I also never said mavs deserved to win that..

Lol`\I want more D-Lo no more Bean please. Tbh though I know a lot of Laker fans who can't wait for this season to be over and Kobe to retire. There's a reason why D'Angelo gets 20+ points a night when Kobe isn't playing but becomes invisible when he is. I'm ready to move on and watch D'Lo take over games more.`\These commentators sound more excited even when the cavs miss a shot than when the Wizards make one`\what happened there?

oh we got a time out, awesome.`\Did you even see the lineup we had?  This ones on your team...`\Huertas is pretty nifty for 32 tho`\In N Out! :D `\Cavs fans, has LeBron been changing the way his minutes are being played? I remember when Blatt was the coach, he would get subbed midway through the quarter. Now it seems like (at least this game), he's playing the entire first quarter. `\Na he destroyed the Cavs the other night when we had 8 players for 26`\Trust me bro why would I lie to someone I've never met before?`\Wtf did tea do to you?`\Fusionnnnnnn`\Fry's 3 pointer is not only better than Love's but has much quicker release.
`\Dragic has to be so surprised he's getting calls in his favor for once`\I wouldn't even be mad.`\Damn Kyrie...who's the one with ice in the veins again?`\your mom`\Yep... still a good game.`\It was great, but only really as a Grizz homer. I've watched greater comebacks, most regrettably the Clippers against the Grizz in the playoffs a few years ago.

I've never before seen so many clutch shots down the stretch from both teams in one game though, in triple OT`\I just gave you an upvote too! Now you have 3! Or you know the amount of quarters the Blazers play in a game 7.`\Looking real good early`\How many wide open threes is Klove gonna miss?
`\yes, begrudgingly yes`\Kind of funny that Beal and Harrison Barnes will likely see max money this offseason.  What a world! Just be kinda good...sometimes....and get max! You get a max! You get a max!`\how much of the car actually made it into the restaurant?`\those announcers were total homers`\I mean it's basically monopoly money at this point.`\lol artest looked lost`\Mr. World Peace is a sociopath. `\KOBEEEEEE `\Extra shot clock time really spreads the game`\I have to congratulate DJ at the line. Pretty solid after those two bad air balls earlier in the game. `\JULIUS!!!!`\Kobe may be doing well but him being on the floor is encouraging iso basketball which is fucking us up big time...we didn't win the last 3 of 5 games off iso-basketball dammit we passed the ball.


Where is the damn movement I saw in the past couple of games?`\L&B or just go back to whatever pizzaless place you come from `\Cavs 22 second chance point, Mavs 0.  WOW`\On and off. Mr Inconsistent.`\He's basically going to be that with D'Lo when they start together.`\PUT IN BEAN`\Cause everyone looks at him through the lens of their own team.  Nobody is going to pay him that much for that kind of production other than the Cavs.  He fills a very niche role that the Cavs need.`\No one said or implied that it did...?`\Man, terrible passes make for the best oops lol`\KILPATRICK!`\tony allen the offensive genius `\=)))))`\It helps that denver is a much better defensive team. He doesnt pass the eye test on defense. In any case, offense is much *much* more important for a guard. And shooting ~10% lower makes this not even a discussion, as much as you so desperately want to sugarcoat it.`\Include the playoffs it's 30%. Also 35% beyond 3 ft `\holy mother of sloppy`\Well if anyone understands nasty falls its PG`\Thats DPROY  Hibbert to you!`\Kobe's going to come in just to knock down a buzzer beater and fully retire right then`\Russ put up 24/6? Both had good games.`\both.`\TT's birthday was last night and the team was in LA...this could be rough`\What are you talking about? He's shown plenty of it. It doesn't always lead to an assist, especially with this offense and roster`\You're fucking naive if you think Dirk would go for a flop in that situation...

It was a clear hook.`\that's all on the perimeter guys, they couldn't get loose`\they are all trying its just that Lebron is the only one succeeding :p`\The Pacers played the 2 for 1 at the end so badly. Just get a shot off, doesn't even have to be a great one as long as its fast.`\Our pick is secure Ayyyy`\But I mean what does everyone expect from them?  Kevin love has less than a week of postseason experience because he got his arm ripped off in his first series ever, and Kyrie also had a short postseason via injury/ rest due to injury and he's barely 24.

I understand their talent and they are professional Bball players but playing at this level is completely new to them.  They've played basketball one single way their whole life and now they have to completely change their game.

Don't get me wrong I'm a bit disappointed in them right now, but come on man look at the circumstances here.`\Thanks JR`\I don't even know why that's the initial assumption. It went to 6 games with no supporting cast for Lebron.`\They should though they could lose the 1st seed`\IDK how LeBron can look confused at watching a relatively small Point Guard, as good as he is defensively, struggle to contest Carter.`\Love is just feasting tonight`\I really hate Lebron`\Bron calmy off the bench...I got dis`\They way we fell apart vs Houston, its unlikely. `\Dammit not Jeff. Hope he's okay `\You're lying.`\Holy fuck Kobe`\I know you're scared that your team has to win a championship with Wade this year or next and has no chance to do that, but try not to get too salty.`\when the lakers lose, we all win!`\But hey that's almost 12`\and even still has consistently said in interviews he's got to improve on defense.

nothing not to like about this dude.`\JJ came to play fuck!`\Next season his contract is going to look perfectly fine.

And he's worth the money, he has alot of value to us.

He's 4th in minutes played this season, almost double Mozgov.



`\why is that a foul on delly exactly? looks like a two sided pushing contest to me. either call jumpball or let them play`\Fuckin AB`\Kobe about to go off. Watch. `\i thought they said that when marc went down`\Knicks and Nets winning on the same day???`\...lmfao...are you fucking serious? 8 sec violation `\YOU GET A 3! YOU GET A 3! EVERYONE GETS A 3! `\I'm not trying to keep it going or anything but it's funny you responded like this when if you had followed the same train of thought you should've not posted what you did. Lol but yea people on the Internet in general need to think like this.
`\Jamal Crawford is one-man offense at it's finest. Chris Paul is maybe the best passer in the league. Jeff Green was a great pickup. This team is gonna be dangerous in playoffs`\Make a free throw Amir`\Soft foul call. `\Cavs finna lose this game`\lol Deron Williams finally hits a shot and it means nothing`\They're Cleveland home announcers. What do you expect? `\People used to hang and then slap the backboard and I guess the league found it unsportsmanlike.`\I'm so happy with everything happening rn`\He's been traveling around, visiting other franchises. The perfect vacation for him.`\Lol. LeBron just waited for that brick.`\How about defense. This is pathetic from a big man. `\Isn't Romo married to Jessica Simpson??  The fuck is going on`\as much as people are scrutinizing Lebron over this off court crap it feels like the medias just ignoring what he has done these past few games besides the 4th quarter vs. Nets. If Kyrie gets it going offensively..man playoffs are gonna be fun.
`\AB finally`\That's shots getting 3000 likes too `\If our bigs get in foul trouble he'll get minutes but honestly I'd rather have Smith backup Vucevic`\Love the song, hate the music video tho. I have no idea why Will thought it was a great idea to make it a salsa song.`\What is this garbage lineup?`\Crowder has never committed a foul in his life

That one was not a foul though`\Compared to these guys maybe? But on what world does MKG suck?`\If he does, I'll pay the fine for him. /s

I remember Kobe did the same celebration, did he get fined for that?`\;)`\Hope you don't like football either`\Why is Sasha Kaun?`\Whole team can't hit open shots right now. They went out the night before.`\Crowder hits Lebron in the face and Boston fan bitching about refs smh`\If you were born in Phoenix and cheer for the Lakers, fuck you.

Cuz fuck him."`\no. he can play with his brother in the olympics, not on the grizz pls. `\Kyrie a fool lmao`\They vary effort depending on circumstances. Back to back, expect Lebron to play both games and go intense tomorrow.`\Fuck you`\Yes but not for the max. He is too inconsistent and injury-prone. He also rarely takes threes event though that his best shot`\How do wiz fans like kelly oubre?  Haven't heard really anything about him this season`\Love still wears the headband when he sits?`\I FUCKING LOVE DLO`\You called it right there. My first major memory of watching an entire CFB season was 2000 when they kept trying to make Drew Henson a thing over Brady. So when Brady took over I was hooked.

And let's face it, the Lions are the Lions. 12 year old me didn't give two shits about them. `\Likely. Could have just been Nurkic's old man.`\keep getting them checks taco bell!`\Mavs miss the most open shots in the league`\Hot garbage eh Kyrie..lol`\My hatred of Bayless (and Monroe) is ever-lasting.`\Oh c'mon God. What did Memphis do?`\Zeller can't rebound for fuck's sake.`\Lance's little one v one battle with LeBron is costing Memphis the game. He's gotta get his head back in it quick`\JR had to see it up close.`\Man, the Celtics need to find some shooting this summer.`\Cut Curry, sign Allen.`\If Kobe sparks a comeback, I'm going to lose my shit.`\3LOOOOOOOOOOOOO`\No sir Lebron not on Deng baby!!! `\Sounds good man. `\Celtics had an 18 point lead earlier `\But it's microscopic.`\One of those groups where the sum is not greater than the parts, unfortunately. They used to be so good defensively inside...now that is gone and they are a middling team.`\We beat the warriors.`\What happened to earnie?`\Fuck this life `\He's having a great time what are you talking about`\Lol i thought i was trippin when i saw that`\Vuc has actually been decent at D since the ASG`\I am a Pacers fan and for the whole fourth quarter my body is one very loud internal scream.`\Clarkson is chucking more than usual today.`\Because that's his best skill...

Do you even know who he is?`\That was almost a sweet dunk by TT.`\That's a parlay right?`\Say what you want about the Lakers but their fans are funny. `\I don't even understand how it's possible to be this bad at everything all the time. It truly boggles the mind.`\What's up with Love's 3 pointers? Usually drains them.`\dat salt.`\You say that like it didn't happen`\It's been a while, my friend.
`\> serves pickles on their nachos.

wait, what?`\Mirza ruins everything `\They look like  a AAU team according to Kobe`\Because there was no change of possession and the ball didn't hit the rim.`\we got Drumpfed`\As others have said, this was an awful game until the 4th quarter. I'd just watch that, it'll save you time anyways.`\Has Austin Rivers played at all today?`\Also I kind of meant it as a joke which you dragged out; since everyone always praises them, and lo and behold the Cavs fans hate them

Also this thread is pretty empty  `\Only TT and kinda LeBron on their team does, and they're both not big enough really.`\Jason Kidd`\Yea`\Wade blocks Kobe! lol`\Lol`\Ryan "Tank God" Kelly comes through in the clutch`\the cavs defense was terrible, just couldn't prevent the nets from penetrating.

Great efficient game by lebron, exploited the nets lack of interior defense for a lot of drives.

Here is what i don't get. lebron has 30 points 13-14 shooting after the 3rd. cavs in the lead. Lebron in the 4th comes in for 6 minutes goes 0-2, letting bojan and young score on him clutch buckets. Now I don't have a problem with him not making two shots but why **take** only 2 shots?? no need to defer so much when you're this hot, he kept passing to everyone bricking instead of taking the shot. weird game. I feel like this is where having a real coach matters.
`\They should allow Kobe to do PED's to end out the season.`\I was on the upper level but ready to jump 50 feet into the air and stomp down on the refs throats if they called that a fucking flagrant`\Don't we all`\can't shoot FT for shit tonight
`\That's one way to get a triple double LOL.`\shit game, I love Lindsay but she's a little stiff (as most first timers would be).   She's smart as hell though and a pretty important MN basketball figure, would love to see her get more experience and turn into a full color analyst for FSN.`\There you go Nick`\damn proud of Randle for scoring the go-ahead bucket with 1.9 left`\Super impressed by what I saw tonight. The core trio showed up and showed out tonight. I hope they build on this tonight and develop some consistency. Larry Nance is someone I do consider to be part of this future core, even if he isn't a starter, and I thought he played a pretty nice game, even after dropping the pass.

One of the very few games I've enjoyed watching this season. I hope they lose from here on out though. I'm 100% against tanking, but at this point, I'd rather see them keep their chances at keeping the pick. They already aren't that great, practically a coin flip, but who knows. Loving what I'm seeing though.  `\;D That's awesome dude`\He's never really had any. `\I bet you one upvote that it's not! `\Delly lighting it up here.`\Kevin just blew a layup, that'd have been a soft foul by this game's standards.`\What a fantastic game by the cavs. I wished shump played like this every game. `\#LETLARRYDUNK

and o shit our bench is catching up`\Cavs fans would know better but when Love returns do you put TT on the bench. Frye looks great out there right now but with Love out there do they occupy the same space?`\meh`\Such a let down`\If Lebron is supposed to be still  little bit out of prime , but not  much it's  point of  season and seeding with Toronto , that if he can't take-over Clippers without Blake -  Curry and Kawhi are better than him and he's starting to show age.

Lebron a player who is CONSTANTLY being put as #2 only to MJ - SHOULD BE able to put down Clippers `\Dammit Love is in foul trouble`\Can our guards start defending and can we fucking stop with the triangle and posting up on every single possession... This is torture...`\Barton is ballin!`\Kyrieeeeee`\well, Lou just got a injury scare....not sure if i can be happy he's missing playing time or sad because of his injury.`\Why Lance.`\Actually

Celtics=Everyone but Leicester? `\It's ded af`\Beal come back to us.`\I don't really care a ton, but why not leave the thread that was posted properly?`\i cannot state enough how much i hate jon barry's commentary`\I don't see a black eye on D'Angelo?`\Yeah dude looks like he wants to prove something`\shot wasn't falling, made up for it by getting to the line. 14 & 11, 26th double double of the year. but yeah it's cool to hate on him so keep doing your thing r/nba!`\Twice too :(`\2strong`\Didn't know AD was on the Clips.`\Shump has been struggling this season`\d'angelo will be a STAR`\The Grizzlies were without Mike Conley, Jordan Adams, Matt Barnes, Zach Randolph, Brandan Wright, Marc Gasol & Chris Andersen...`\you're such a shitty coach`\James Jones still in league?`\Good for him really.  Really surprised about this late season identity.  Though it's gonna suck watching a Gasol-less Grizzlies playoff series.  `\He just did.`\Probably the same thing that happened to Bosh. When you don't get the # of post ups ur used to, don't have a bigger green light on your team and are encouraged to spot up more your rythem is off. The injuries probably don't help either.`\pretty sure chalmers tore that achilles.  shit.`\it makes me happy when larry dunks`\Might not see it a whole lot this game, DJ's 5-7. But as soon as he misses two in a row then watch out. *shit he just missed both. *and then airballed one. Beautiful.`\I agree with you man, but unfortunately there's a bandwagon going on in this thread that's why you getting downvoted`\that was a nice chuck it up there by Clarkson`\Austin Rivers is underrated nobody on Reddit is going to admit it though.`\How many more open threes are the Lakers going to give to Cleveland`\I don't shit on Russell endlessly though. I hope he becomes a great player. I just hope Mudiay becomes a better one. Also, the main thread you are probably talking about was the Nuggets vs lakers who has a better young core thread. In there 90% of the people were lakers fans so obviously the people talking about the nuggets were more noticeable. And last night there were about 15 dlo posts in a span of 30 minutes, it was annoying. `\IT"S BASS! IT"S BASS!`\Do we have a game now? `\Russell and Clarkson might get 60.`\Memphis is such a fun team to root for `\WE DID IT REDDIT`\Kobes not some 9 year old that NBA players feel bad for`\one down`\I mean do we really need this win? We still have to play the Suns 2 times. You think losing the lead over the Suns to win a few games is worth it?`\Not yet a contender but Lakers are a legit playoff team without Kobe. Such great young talent. Bright future  ahead
next year`\This is going to be a fun game. Very physical`\I mean incorporating each other. Lebron can make Love and Kyrie look great, but Love and Kyrie can't do that to each other`\The first quarter just ended...`\At least Rudy gets buckets `\Oh boy, Kobe and Lou in at the same time`\He was up til 3 last night working on that one`\None of my friend want to engage me on this, but can we talk about how sick of a purchase a yellow World Peace jersey is? I mean, when it comes to buying an NBA jersey, there isn't much better you can do. I hate the Lakers, but it's fucking hilarious on an iconic canvas. Only better I can think of is one of those Denver skyline jerseys from the 90s (doesn't matter to me who it is) or a Carter dinosaur Raptors jersey. Thoughts?`\Tacos two games in a row. What a time to be alive.`\Ball was clearly above the rim.  I'm sure Austin Carr told you otherwise but it's true`\What about the foul where love lost the ball and they still called a foul? `\that was a travel call to lebron I thought.

Thomson I disagree,  that was a self trip, watch his legs. Thomson isn't small enough to fly like that. `\What's a King to a God? LeBron vs Russell?`\Uhh we did too.`\Clarkson dunk that shit`\TONY <333`\DAE 82 MIL?!?`\Zach Randolph can ball, son. This ain't Austin Rivers.`\As Stan Van Gundy once said, just form a fucking wall.`\there's a reason we sometimes call him Julius Handle`\Why is Wesley Johnson not seen as more of a bust? 4th pick in the draft, taken ahead of Cousins, Monroe, Hayward, George. Yet you rarely see his name mentioned with the biggest busts as of late`\No. They were chanting lebron needs Riley`\nothing at all tbqh`\those poor families tho, between that and the show some serious old wounds gettin opened up.

the show is fire idgaf, i'm learning so much.`\I'm ready for tweets.`\at home drinking beer

no`\Yes!`\Let's bring this shit back man..`\get that weak shit outta here bron`\marcelo lol :D`\Just awful offense.`\Lol randle celebration`\Why did ESPN say the Clippers were in the bonus when they weren't`\Unfortunately, Doc still doesn't understand the concept of staggering their minutes though.`\i know we've shot incredible but if i'm a clippers fan...fuck. they just appear to give up a lot.`\That might legit be the worse LeBron iso I've seen`\LeBron Kias vs Miami Heat`\Yeah let's not talk about Zeller. But ET is cash from the free-throw line and in. Literally cash.`\Come on Wizards, step it up, the commentators are talking about Manu's balls`\Frye got a strap`\Dante is good given he hasn't lost any speed. He played the best D of any rookie point I've ever seen, he may just be a one trick pony at worst... But defense is half the game, so that's a pretty good trick.`\Don't be mean to STAT!!! Even if it's the truest.`\We couldn't get anyone instead of him, so yes`\Really didn't think this would need a /s...`\Devin is a worse FT shooter than Rajan Rondo`\No doubt...dude is all hustle`\[RANDLE!!!!](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-pAiZOGmCqN0/UzZRkZuSeHI/AAAAAAAAEZE/-8ljG21K8Zc/s1600/7.gif)`\> a Kyrie for Lowry

I thought Huertas was like in his early 20s because I just found out who he was, and I thought he was breaking out as a good player...

He's 32, wow.`\MAKE THEM FUCKING DANCE LANCE `\ZBo would be a damn HOF'er`\CP3/Reddick look tired like Lowry last year. `\Its obvious he wasn't.. `\This is fun`\It's almost as if a high tier team defeating a low tier team doesn't generate that much interest.`\The best team in LA won against the Warriors and didn't lose to a short-handed Grizzlies`\Been pretty shit winning all those championships especially the one the Lakers stepped over the Kings on their way to amirite`\Cavs offense is putrid. `\yo who mans was that?`\the two things aren't mutually exclusive.`\yikes, Clarkson ice cold tonight. 0-6 from the floor (0-3 from 3)`\He throws out a 3-point-guard reserve lineup often-- and Mavs fans have been bitching about it for about 2-3 months now--nothing that CP3 forced...he just highlighted it in that ugly 3rd quarter.`\Hang on everyone.  No celebrating until our good pal from the nuggets shows up.`\Randle probing like Nash, and finding shooters!?`\I mean yeah.. it couldn't be more clear to me that was intentional, for tank purposes.`\What's he bitching about lmao?`\Heat are legit contenders in the East, I can see them beating Cleveland.`\Wow, I feel so bad for you being forced to watch a biased commentator while you're illegally watching a game for free.`\We're downvoting because you're a shitty troll. You're not fooling anyone `\That's that Ryan Kelly signature hustle play`\DO YOU NEED ANOTHER ONE`\LET'S GO`\Thanks. We owe you one! `\i like james harden
`\Farmar deserves to be in the Chinese league.`\All we have to do is lock Lou inside a van`\We need more ball movement lol`\TONY IS GOING HAM`\Because kyrie and love are overrated. They aren't wade and bosh, and they have a weaker second team.

Does he get tired?`\and i guess jordan mcrae`\Damn these commentators are shit lol, that deep ass 3 and all he says is "welp"`\Cool, that's what I though, was making sure it wasn't like a brace or any sign of injury. `\Holy shit Huertas`\Not pasta. Made it myself at home.`\Yeah the lack of quotes was a tip-off. It does make me think more about the lack of ball movement on the Cavs tho`\Doesn't the fact that you say that bother you? He's the third superstar.`\I feel bad for LeBron haters. Missing out on one of the greatest to ever do it. `\maybe byron had them running suicides this afternoon or something. you can't rule it out.`\Just so weird that Dirk/any Mav will set a blatant moving screen and no one will mention it.`\im ded guys`\I'm going to guess the rebound advantage was like +20 for Cleveland.

Note: Data from basketball-reference, March 9th. Data from ranges 0-3,3-10,10-16,16-&lt;3pt,3p are plotted to the midpoint of the range. For example, FG% for 0-3 is plotted at 1.5 feet, 3-10 at 6.5, 10-16 at 13, 16-&lt;3pt at 19.875. 3pt% is plotted at 23.75 however.

I live in LA, so they're like my JV team. We need at least one established defensive player in the backcourt/wing position...and Russel is way more valuable than Clarkson.

Honestly I think he peaked a little too early in the season. Everyone (myself included) got super high expectations of him - especially after he scored 27 and was looking like superstar potential.

`\[:(](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IUGqSLbLzFU)`\why are these commentators talking like they are recording a podcast `\Fuck those- fuck those sleeves that y'all been wearin`\Yep they hardcore choked`\See the thing is it's going to sound crazy to read this but Lebrons game is not fundamentally strong. He has always gotten by with just being the biggest strongest fastest guy, so he only knows one way to score which is to attack the basket and then find the open man when the defense collapses on him. But love is not a spot up shooter, his game is to pound away in the post. Lebron just wanted him to stay in the corners and hit threes, but love isn't that type of player. That's why frye is fitting in so well, that's his strength to any team. Love needs to stay in the post and shoot the midrange shot. Lebron also needs to come to the realization that he won't be the fastest and strongest guy and learn how to score without just throwing himself into the paint. `\Russell, Randle, and Clarkson all on pace for 20+ points. Good stuff.`\yep you're dumb as fuck. if you wanna keep referring to the past well too bad it's 17 > 16. got you good ;)`\He has several great post ups today.`\Wow Thomas that was impressive`\Ok, you're right you're sick dude `\Who the fuck is JayMychal Green?`\I agree, but even in some blowout wins he is awful.

I mean, [look at his stats]( http://espn.go.com/nba/player/gamelog/_/id/3449/kevin-love) in games this year. Other then a good November and a decent Janurary he has been absolute shit.`\everybody likes chris paul, just not when hes playing your team`\Dude, is the game fun? I contemplating on buying it.`\That 4th quarter was dreadful. `\There's very very few players I would be more surprised to see go 12/12 from the field than Tony Allen haha `\Dacos`\I don't know why he's on TV, everyone I know hates the guy. Talks so much shit. `\Dragic is totes adorbs`\I always get pimples and I'm 24 :/

Weather it be my forehead, arms or back`\Enjoy the swampbutt that comes with living in Houston.`\Hoping we can see vintage performances from both Kobe and Wade`\Probably one of Lebrons best games this season`\channing frye making sure he's showing channing tatum who the real channing in this building is`\Sounds like a French-Korean model`\Yes!`\What a play`\JR Swish`\Don't underestimate the goon squad ( might as well )`\A N D 1`\I love this clippers commentator this old man he has a very soothing and sexy voice... it really turns me on when he talks

when he says "ohh me ohh my" I get the biggest boner when he gets excited I get really excited

the other guy not so much he has zero basketball knowledge `\Clipper feed just advertised a reality tv show for their cheerleaders...`\Thanks, cavs bros.

Now if we could just have an offense in the 4th, that'd be great.`\No Hibbert.`\gotta keep that 100% FG`\At least there's no more games in LA`\Its more of CP3 being on the bench atm`\But we beat Thunder, Clippers and Toronto under Blatt too`\Love and Thompson have a combined 2 rebs. 2. Two. `\boooyyyy`\That's that fish mother fucker, Mike Trout. Next was Matt Kemp. `\Love isn't Bosh. Bosh's defensive versatility enabled the success of the Heat. The fact that all 3 of their stars were elite defenders, arguably the best in their respective positions. At the Cavaliers, the best defenders are LeBron and Shump. Irving at best is average, Love is a negative. The Heat suffocated their opponents defensively. The Cavs can't do that with Love.

I absolutely love Kevin, but he needs to find a way to defend better or be a regular perimeter scorer because otherwise he only hurts the team. I still maintain that for a team to be elite they need elite defensive big men. Cavs have 1 at best: Tristan Thompson. GSW have Bogut, Draymond. Spurs with Aldridge, Duncan. Thunder with Ibaka, Clippers with DeAndre. Cavs will probably make the finals because they are immensely talented, but they'll have to find something unique to beat Cavs that circumvent Love's weaknesses.

There's a reason why I'm excited about our future: we have an elite defending big man who also has the potential to be the complete player. But, that defence is fundamental as our whole team can revolve around that.`\Traffic cones don't drop dimes`\Cant even tank correctly`\Ingram is a better fit in that he fills a position of need. But, Simmons combination of size, ball handling, passing, rebounding and athleticism is hard to avoid taking if we have a first pick. In todays NBA for some reason I feel like a Simmons-Randle Front Court could work. It would just depend on Simmons defensive ability at 6'10. `\Anyone have a link to the game?`\For one thing, he doesn't seem to know what he wants to do with rotations. Some nights they'll be fine and other nights it'll seem random`\Cavs had twice as many free throws bro`\Wow Lebron!`\Nope`\Bang. Nice shit Bojan`\We all will man. Damn. Damn, damn. `\So, you guys?

Note: Data from basketball-reference, March 16th. Data from ranges 0-3,3-10,10-16,16-<3pt,3p are plotted to the midpoint of the range. For example, FG% for 0-3 is plotted at 1.5 feet, 3-10 at 6.5, 10-16 at 13, 16-<3pt at 19.875. 3pt% is plotted at 23.75 however. The curves in between ARE NOT to be used to extrapolate data accurately, it merely shows the *trend* between separate points, as the area under the curves divided by a unit length will not provide the FG% for the range as an average value.`\Refs were all over the place today. `\[fuck my shit up fam](http://imgur.com/HYO0vAg)`\So Powell is buried on the bench again?`\Disgusting :(`\When has Kyrie ever facilitated well?`\Tony Allen, offensive GENIUS.`\TACOS PLS`\FUCKING SMALL BALL`\"Anything is possible"`\Come on, man, he included the "(not)" specifically to avoid this type of comment.`\[Randle going hard tonight!](http://i.imgur.com/VTsmai1.png)`\It's comforting to know that the Lakers just keep on winning despite the off-court problems`\Lol`\My god.

Bring Timmy off the bench and only play like 15 min.? Heck yeah Boban.`\no T`\Isn't a no call more of the refs *not* deciding the game though?

He honestly looks like he's just mopey about not being the best player on his team anymore. The best he ever looked on the Cavs was in the playoffs last year before Olynk tried ripping his arm off. `\I don't think anyone is disputing that he had a bad game. It's more that having one bad game deserved having an entire post about it seemed a bit harsh and reactionary. Also TT's role is highly dependent on having Lebron play alongside him. We're not paying him to create his own offense or anything like that so I think what he does when Lebron isn't playing isn't nearly as consequential as what he does when he is. Sorry to bring this argument back up, my points look a whole lot better in retrospect and that isn't 100% fair. `\Kobe!`\He was definitely real sloppy in the post. Dribbling, foot work and passing out.. He just couldn't do it tonight. I'm not worried about KLove.

Lmfao`\What if I told you the Celtics only committed one more foul than the Cavs in this game?`\Typical bandwagon fan misinformation.`\Every time I see him play I think "Z would have caught that pass"`\You're right. Huertas just looks small compared to the others on the court. Less hair then. `\Lebron and Kyrie are both black holes sometimes. I think it really throws off the offense and lets the other team go on runs. They are definitely the most talented team. But it takes a long time for superstars to unlearn bad habits.`\Now. Or soon.

Because JKidd...`\I'm a worrier`\Or how we went vs them in regular season?`\Well there is our patented 3rd quarter`\But you still did and that's what matters.`\Good cutting, and the bigs are recognizing the openings :)`\And the fact it's the ref BEHIND TA that calls the foul. Guess he could have hadva but of an angle on it, but it couldn't have been much. `\so good to see huertas having fun out there`\god, not one of these girls can dunk. what a waste.`\Yeah 2 of the biggest homers in the league`\holy shit theres two healthy bodies on the Grizz bench `\The fact that I still have to argue whether he's an offensive positive should tell you quite clearly that he's still underrated.`\Doc is the coach version of the old man who screams at kids for hitting baseballs into his yard.`\Ya know, you're not all that bad. cheers`\you wish`\We outchea`\we have so many bad NBA players on our team`\Getting tired of yo ass muthafucker`\i find your lack of faith disturbing`\wow the comeback`\How about 400mg of AB?`\uhhh, you are only down by 4...`\Thanks Magic.`\Metta hasn't been productive in a looong while`\I shall hoist the victory video! https://streamable.com/4uq1`\Damn Ryan Kelly...i see you`\I still can't believe they paid Tristan Thompson $82 million to rebound`\Lue already said he's going back to the 3 tomorrow night.

Not to mention averaging a turnover more. `\Mozgov is horrendous. `\RJ's voice gets me every time.`\Dirk be like ayyyyyy`\maan especially against the cavs. Now you just put shump on wall and whoever on temple..`\he's a physical freak. sometimes fouling is the only way to stop him`\yep I reckon this is our hot game`\Nah, my favorite player is actually Amare, haha`\That Charlie standing up and yelling at DJ from the bench? Lol love it`\downvotes for continuing the joke? Stay classy r/nba`\:/ at least you'll still have Nance Jr!`\Fallon D'floor`\Off season trade? He probably has some worth, even a second rounder. Decent contract with 2 years left at 7Mil. Plenty of teams will have space and someone will want a 6th man.`\Knicks losing to Nets doesn't feel so horrible anymore, I can finally get over it completely. `\You realize he's +8 for the game right now.  It couldn't possible have been cause JR is 2-9 (0-4) for -9 or shump who is -7.`\a 10-0 run in 1:30 without lebron. damn`\2 early fouls on Wall

pls`\Kevin Love just went raggedy ann.`\ok then.`\LMAO good game Cleveland. Nice foul against Lebron.`\Jamal says fuck your 3 point defense`\Lay the pipe JR`\ahahaha i love it, thanks for pointing that out`\none of those teams are better without them though`\I LOVE JAMYCHAL GREEN

TRIPLE DOUBLE ALERT?`\Sooo, great game going on over in Boston...
Anyway, how about that battle between the Clippers and OKC!`\Lyk dis if u upvot evry tim `\Grit and fucking grind. I love this team and I love this city`\Clips will sweep`\Cleveland bench shit the bed.`\They all scared of the blazers lol`\Dafuq am i watchin`\Things you wont find in NY:

1. Guard defense

2. Linebackers

3. Pizzas made is a cast iron skillet`\Amare had 12pts on 54% shooting in 24 mins, David Lee with 11pts on 67% shooting in 4 less minutes. Carlisle has said David Lee will get more minutes as this season progresses so expect him to easily pass what am amare did on offense last year`\With thunderous applause`\I hope Afflalo opts out and Calderon retires after this year.`\Damn, Randle is a double double machine!`\You actually want to win?`\wELL THAT WAS ROUGH

EDIT: oops`\Wonder what story comes out after this game. `\Cuz we beat the Warriors`\Can't wait for "Niiiiiiice!" by Hubie Brown`\there was a fan yelling profanity at him before`\thats called a fadeaway`\Where's the NBA hate? Seems like it just keeps gaining popularity little by little.`\We have other guys who can play. Gay, Collison, Casspi can put it in the hoop but Karl continuously calls the Boogie fucking iso at the ends of games.`\No`\Orlando makin our defense look good`\HE HAS NO HELP BRO`\Watching jj redick is mesmerizing `\Do the Clippers not even try to offensive rebound?`\oh yeah, I forgot this team doesn't know how to maintain a lead`\I can never get them to work. It always says that it couldn't be oppened.`\Why didn't LeBron just roll to the rim right then? They already committed the double to Kyrie.`\I see the down voting has started `\WTF with these weak loose ball fouls. `\Korver didn't even touch him but okay...`\Oh wow`\This post game thread will be quiet. Can't talk about how much LeBron is declining, or how LeBron hates Kyrie, or Kyrie can't wait to leave Cleveland.`\This commentator is a butthurt little bitch... Jesus`\Yeah like *8*`\I know he can't sustain it but I wanna see Kobe take every shot from now on.`\Link to the old thread?`\I love r&b songs like that that flow so well even without rhyme. I don't think there's a single line in Pony that rhymes`\Put in CP3....I feel bad for the people that paid for a ticket`\most overrated player in the NBA`\He sure doesn't want the Cavs to win, because Cavs, but at the same time he is a firm believer in fuck the Celtics apparently`\Russell post-ups to slow it down`\Dave joeger is a great coach`\VINTAGE!!`\That's what an extra 16 possessions from offensive rebounds and turnovers will do for you.`\Thats not what winter is coming means...`\ICE IN THE VEINS`\
