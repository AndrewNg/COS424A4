Now this is far too harsh of a response from the refs, but draymond did the same thing. Ok. That's understandable, guys don't usually get T'd up for that. In the third quarter, he missed a free throw and hits the ball at the ref so hard it almost smacks him in the face. Not sure why he gets away with this, but maybe the ref didn't think it was intentional or egregious. A little later, he gets called for a foul trying to run through a Steven Adams' pick like he's Von Miller. Common foul, no issue with that. He proceeds to get in the refs face while repeating ""how is that a foul on me?"". The ref turns to walk away, and draymond just follows him.What I'm really asking is how many other guys could get away with all of this stuff?Edit: So this post has devolved into a lot of shit talking.

(disclaimer: there are commercials interspersed throughout)If you watch just the first 15 seconds of the second half video (it starts about 12 seconds into the second half). After a foul has been called on draymond, he gets up, starts walking away from the ref and the first four words out of his mouth are ""Fucking Bullshit, God Damn"". If that happens once, okay maybe he should get away with it, but after every other foul or whistle against his team? Probably not.

635,nba,"The 6th through 9th seeds in the Western Conference are all within a game and a half of each other, and tonight is of special importance since Portland and Dallas play each other tonight, as do Utah and Houston.Currently Portland is sitting in 6th, Dallas in 7th, Houston 8th, and Utah 9th, but all of that could change in a hurry.Here's some implications for each team if they win or lose:If Portland wins and Utah wins:Portland solidifies their spot in the 6th seed a bit more, giving them a 2 win cushion going into the last 10 games of the season. Dallas and Utah will be in a virtual tie for the 7th seed, making their third and final head-to-head game on April 11th all the more vital. Houston will move back to 9th.If Portland wins and Houston wins:Portland expands to a game lead on the other three, with Houston pulling into 7th, and Dallas in 8th, with Utah falling to a game out of the playoffs.If Dallas wins and Utah wins:Portland moves down to the 7th spot, with Dallas overtaking them. Utah moves into the playoffs at 8, and Houston moves down the 9th.If Dallas wins and Houston wins:Dallas moves into 6th, and the Blazers and Rockets will have the same record, be 2-2 in head-to-heads, and neither will win their division, so they will have to go to a third tie breaker (that I cannot find specification on) to determine seeding. Utah will have to start to go into panic mode as they will be at least two wins out of the playoffs.Last note: Dallas has a game left against Utah and a game against Houston. Both of those are important for any potential tie-breakers. A win against Utah gives them the head-to-head tiebreaker, and a win against Houston makes their series 2-2, forcing an additional tiebreaker, whereas a loss gives Houston the head-to-head tiebreaker.

This immediately eliminates the 44 loss Bucks and Knicks, who cannot finish with a better record than 38-44.The Orlando Magic, meanwhile, only have 43 losses and could conceivably tie the Pacers or Pistons by winning their remaining games in the event that whichever of the Pistons or Pacers loses all of their remaining games.  However, if that situation were to occur, the Magic would lose the head to head season series, 3-1 to the Pacers or 2-1 to the Pistons.  As a result, you would need a multi-way tie.  At this point, however, the only teams that can be involved in such a multi-way tie are the Bulls and Wizards, but since the Magic are 0-4 against the Wizards, this leaves only 4 teams in the potential ties (And any 2 way ties are meaningless since all 3 end with the Pacers and Pistons making the playoffs):  The Bulls, Pacers, Pistons, and Magic.A 3 way tie between the Pacers, Pistons, and Magic does not work -- the first tiebreaker is head to head record within the group and the Pacers would win that with a record of 6-2, compared to the Pistons at 3-4 and the Magic at 2-5.  After that the Pistons' 2-1 record over the Magic gives them the last spot.A 3 way tie between the Pacers, Pistons, and Bulls does not work -- The Magic would have to have a worse record than those 3 teams and would be eliminated.A 3 way tie between the Pacers, Bulls, and Magic does not work -- For this tie to occur, it would have to be at 39-43 and the Pistons would have to have won an additional game.  This leaves 1 spot, which would be claimed by the Bulls, with a record within the group of 4-3, compared to the Pacers at 4-4 and the Magic at 3-4.A 3 way tie between the Pistons, Bulls, and Magic does not work -- Much like the last tie, the Pacers would have to be better than 39-43, leaving one spot that would go to the Pistons, who would be 4-3 within the tied teams, compared to the Magic at 3-3 and Bulls at 3-4.A 4 way tie between all 4 teams, finally, does not work -- With 2 spots open, the first spot would go to the Pacers, with a record within the group of 7-5, compared to the Magic's 4-6, the Bulls 6-5, and the Pistons 5-6.

1595,nba,"Thanks to our friends at basketball reference, we have shooting data on every player in the league, broken down by distance and percentage. So I looked at how Curry is performing on the year shooting the ball versus other notable scorers.As you would expect, Curry's numbers are just absurd. His average shot distance is from 17.2 feet away (just shy of your old high school 3-point line), and yet he's hitting at an overall clip of .510 on 20 attempts per game. For comparison, LeBron's average FGA is from 9.9 feet away, and he's shooting just .504 on 18.8 shots per game. But, LeBron has never been a particularly great shooter, and he's having an off season. So let's look at some more comparable scorers:Harden: 14.4 ft and .433 on 19.7 shots per game. Lillard: 14.9 ft - .431 - 20.2Paul George: 16.4 ft - .416 - 18.2JJ Redick: 19.5 ft - .474 - 11.9DeRozan: 11.1 - .446 - 17.6Melo: 13.6 - .432 - 18.1Klay: 16.4 - .468 - 17.1Kawhi: 13.3 - .509 - 15.0(Curry: 17.2 - .510 - 20.0)Really, only 3 of these guys are comparable: Redick, Klay and Kawhi. Redick strokes it at over 47% from almost 20 feet away, but he's only taking 11 shots a game (about half of what Curry is putting up). Klay hits at close to 47% from over 16 feet on 17 shots a game, which is extremely impressive, but he falls a good amount short of Steph in volume and FG%. Kawhi hits at the best percentage, just shy of 51, but he takes 5 less shots a game and shoots from 4 feet closer on average.So 3 of the best shooting-scorers in the league and Curry is blowing each of them out of the water. Plus, his nearest competitor is almost assuredly benefiting efficiency wise from Curry being out there with him. Curry should be the best shooter in the league by a mile, and everyone acknowledges that he is, because it would only make sense with his current tour of destruction taking place at an arena near you. Except, unfortunately for Steph, he's sharing his prime with this guy:Kevin Durant: 14.6 ft - .507 - 19.0 FGA/gSure, Curry bests Durant in each category. He shoots from farther away, hits at a better %, and he takes more shots. But the fact that Durant is, you know, three tenths of a percent worse while taking 95% as many shots just two and a half feet closer to the basket is, frankly, unbelievable. Unfortunately, shot tracking data only goes back about 15 years, but it's basically impossible to find any season since 2000 that compares to even Durant. Dirk scratches the ceiling, but when his attempts are as high as Curry and KD his FG% isn't as good, and when his FG% is there he's either taking less shots or shooting closer to the hoop (or both). His closest year was 2014 where he took 15.9 shots a game 16.7 feet away and hit .497. But still, that's 4 less attempts per game than Curry with a lower %. Nash had a couple .500+ seasons (his best was .504 with 17.2 feet) but he never took more than 14 shots a game.Guys I'm curious about are Bird, MJ and Adrian Dantley, but I don't think any of them shot as far away from the basket as Curry or Durant (Bird, contrary to legend, took very few 3s in his career).It's very, very possible that when accounting for volume Curry and Durant are basically having the 2 best shooting seasons in league history in the same season. So the next time Oscar Robertson stops you on the street and talks about the glory days, drop some knowledge on him.

We get to the game and I couldn't believe where the seats were.http://i.imgur.com/TWkCC8R.jpgI had to close the proshop that evening so I left straight from the course to the game. Game goes on, half time rolls around and Chris Paul comes up and starts talking to Andre Johnson, and we were right behind him. He saw I was in full out golf attire and asked if I played, and I told him I was the assistant out at Westwood GC. We chatted for a few minutes before he left to go warm up for the second half.http://i.imgur.com/peXSGvf.jpgGame ends, and we are getting ready to leave. I heard someone yell ""hey"" and I don't know why I turned around but I did and coach Mike Woodson was there. He said that Chris had mentioned to him I was an assistant at Westwood, and he asked if there were any tee times the next morning. I told him the course is usually dead during the week. He said okay cool, and left and I didn't think much of it. Well the next morning I had to open to shop at 6:30 and we get a call and sure enough it was Mr. Woodson. He was wondering if he said he could set up a tee time for Coach Rivers, himself, and Coach Cassell. I told him absolutely, and again figured they would come out, play, and leave. They get there and since they had three they asked if I was available or one of the other pro's were available to join them. I lied and said I was the only one (who could pass up that opportunity.) So I grabbed my sticks and went out and played 18 holes with them, and it was an unforgettable experience. I talked to Coach Woodson about his invitational golf tournament he holds in the summer just to start a conversation and it ends with him asking for my contact information so he could send me and invite to the tournament. We go ahead and exchange numbers before they left and call it a day. Sadly because I was at work and out playing golf it totally skipped my mind to ask for a picture with them on 18, and after they left I turned to one of the other assistants and said, ""How the f**k does one forget to ask for a picture with those guys around?"" He laughed and called me a dumbass. Regardless, this was such an awesome opportunity to have and I enjoyed every second of it, and am now looking forward to Coaches tournament in the summer.Edit: Going to check the pro shop security camera to see if there is a candid shot of us headed to the first tee or anything!",21,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/4b1kbd,Played golf with the Clippers Coaching Staff yesterday.,I gave it five golf claps.,http://reddit.com/r/nba/comments/4b1kbd/c/d15mti4,744,0

(Besides that GSW might break one in a couple of weeks)Wilt's 50 per game scoring average (NEVER be broken, nearly impossible to do in modern day with defense that does not allow someone to get garbage baskets for 48+ MPG)Wilt's 55 rebound game (Never happen, not enough missed shots due to pace and lack of talent in shooting to miss shots that often)Russell's 11 rings (Will never happen, considering the average NBA Player does not even play this much, only close way would be like Robert Horry, who is not a superstar, so it is more normal to bounce from contender to contender)Lakers 33 game win streak (Still possible, considering GSW was at 24 [ONE STREAK ONE SEASON], one team can get incredibly hot but most likely a 5% chance ever gets broken)George McInnis 422 turnovers in one season (Seems likely, but numerically, this is averaging 5.16 TOPG playing every game. Only way that this would happen is having a superstar on a terrible team, where the coach doesn't care. AKA James Harden if he was on Philly)Wilt's 100 point game (Nope, hell no, never. Curry and Durant are the only 2 who would come close now, but I can't see them eclipsing 75, 80 would be nearly impossible for either, and I doubt someone would be able to play for pretty much 48 minutes and score a basket every minute)Chicago's 72 win season (About to get broken by GSW, even if they don't, just need a super team with a weak conference, why GSW can do it this year)Skiles 30 assist game (This too sounds nearly impossible as pointguards are deviating from playmaking like this, and when they do [Rondo] they are criticized for it bc they are chasing stats)Rasheed's 41 technicals (With the NBA and teams caring so much about public image now, they would not allow this. There would be some sort of long term suspension by the time they reach 35. Only way is if 3 seconds in the key was somehow considered a technical [I know its not] and then you get Eddy Curry to sit in the paint for a couple of games)Calderon's 98.1 free throw percentage (This is incredible too as the better shooters in the league will most likely never reach this since Calderon only took 154 FT's so he only needed to make 151, and for someon like Curry takes over double, and with that many, there is much larger deviation, so even though Curry is a better shooter, his best is only 93.4%)Tell me what you think",37,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/4cbbpd,"Bill Simmons's Unbreakable Records, and will they be broken?",I just came,http://reddit.com/r/nba/comments/4cbbpd/c/d1h05oh,464,9

McClendon is accused of ""colluded with another oil and natural gas company over a five year period to avoid bidding against each other for leases in Oklahoma, with the pre-determined winner allocating part of the lease to the “loser.”If convicted, will the other owners of OKC distance themselves or punish McClendon? He supposedly has as recently as 2014, purchased additional shares of the team from other co-owner, Jefferey Records Jr. If the NBA chooses to discipline McClendon, it wouldn't be the first time. The NBA fined McClendon $250,000 in response to statements he made to the press shortly after they moved the Seattle SuperSonics to Oklahoma City, as his statements contradicted the organization's publicized intentions at the time. McClendon disclosed to the OKC Journal Record that the team had planned to move the team all along, despite their public stance that they'd wanted to keep the team in Seattle.
Here are McClendon's comments that resulted in a $250,000 fine:“We didn’t buy the team to keep it in Seattle, we hoped to come here. We know it’s a little more difficult financially here in Oklahoma City, but we think it’s great for the community and if we could break even we’d be thrilled.”“We started to look around and at that time the Sonics were going through some ownership challenges in Seattle,” McClendon told the Journal Record. “So Clay, very artfully and skillfully, put himself in the middle of those discussions and to the great amazement and surprise to everyone in Seattle, some rednecks from Oklahoma, which we’ve been called, made off with the team.”SourceSourceUPDATE: Won't face jail time; died today in a car accident.

2765,nba,"Preface: I don't want this to come off as a CJ McCoullum hate post, but I selected to evaluate his improvement because he seems to be /r/nba's popular choice for MIP.Steph Curry Per 36 PPG: 32.6 (+6.4 from last year's)CJ McCoullum Per 36 PPG: 21.4 (+5.7 from last year's)(Per 36) Curry is taking 15% more attempts than last year and getting 26% more FTA. Meanwhile, CJ is taking 39% more attemps and shooting just as many FT's as last year (2.7)People deny it, but CJ's improvement is a result of more minutes and more attempts. This season, his True Shooting % is the exact same as last season's; Curry's has jumped by 4.7%...I do not watch enough Trail Blazers games to know if CJ has improved his defense by a notable extent but I don't think I've read anything on the subject.Traditionally, end of season awards are given to players on good teams. While the Blazers are exceeding expectations, Steph is on possibly the greatest team of all time.As for the Wil Barton, Lowry, and Crowder MIP fans, they've made great strides but I don't think any reasonable argument could be made for their improvement over Curry's.TLDR: CJ is a popular choice for MIP. Per 36, Curry has greater increase in PPG (while increasing his attempts by 15% vs CJ's 39%). CJ's TS% is the exact same; Curry's is +5%. Historically, end-of-year awards go to players on good teams; Curry is on the best team.EDIT:
New TLDR: Curry improved the most but he already has so much so he doesn't deserve it. An MVP has never won it before, so therefore it will never happen and should never happen.EDIT: Since this is getting some attention, I want to state that every fan of any team would behave the exact same way as Warriors fans if given the roster.

2868,nba,"As requested by /u/Jabbajaw in r/warriors yesterday, here's another bit on the differences in Dubs losses versus Spurs losses.Losses aren’t all that common when we’re talking about the Spurs and Warriors in 2016, but it’s worth taking a look at how  those losses happen when they do. As it turns out, not only do these teams win differently, but they lose differently.Assumptions here are that this late in the season, there won’t be major deviation that would change the conclusions found since all the stats are season-long averages. All pulled from stats.nba.com (Synergy Sports).Here’s the stats for the Warriors and Spurs in losses, compared to their losses:Both had significant decreases in their FG% and in their 3PT%, but those weren’t as drastically different as the numbers above. The Warriors’ dropped about 9 and 11 and the Spurs’ dropped about 6 and 10, respectively.No one’s surprised that there’s a significant drop off in points scored when the team loses, but this is a drastic drop. A couple of the Dubs’ losses have been pretty bad, like getting crushed by Portland and whooped by the Lakers. What I get from the Spurs’ more modest drop-off in losses is that these two teams lose in profoundly different ways.Assertion: The Warriors’ losses are predicated on the failure of their offense, while the Spurs’ losses come from a defensive failure.The Spurs’ points per game are more consistent between losses and wins because they beat teams by dragging them down to their pace level (23rd in the league, just over 95.). When they fail to do that, teams out-shoot their offensive capabilities. That’s not to say they can’t have offensive explosions too, but they’re far less volatile because of their style of play.The Warriors, however, are a walking squad of heat-checks. Possibly the best ever, but the fire does go out on occasion (seven occasions, so far). That massive difference in PPG from wins to losses. Everyone knows the Warriors can bury you, but if you can catch them on a cold night or chase them out of their comfort zone, they become tangible.Look at it this way: both teams drown you, but the Spurs do it by pushing your head below the surface, where the Warriors do it by running a hose to the top of the tank. If you can keep your head above water, you can knock them off.",20,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/4cll2k,Rare Occasions: How the Warriors and Spurs Lose,"Additional note/edit: It's due to pace, but the Warriors give up the 11th-most PPG to opponents in all games, at just over 104.

2931,nba,"Ok, so the Clippers have been an elite offensive team for the last 5 years, but their defense has been up-and-down. Last year in what was perhaps their best offensive season of the Blake-Paul regime, they had an average defense which propelled two of their players to All-Defensive teams. Whether or not they deserved those honors is beside the point as both are at least good defensive players. The other three starters for most of the season were Blake, Reddick, and Barnes. I've never been too hot on Blake's defense, but others say it's good. Reddick has poor physical tools, but he is no slouch and gives great effort. Barnes was a good defender in most situations. Obviously the bench consisting of Big Baby, Jamal, Hedo, Austin, Hawes, etc. was very bad on defense, but considering that the starters play a majority of the minutes and Doc is decent at staggering lineups, it's hard to see how their defense would be straight average when they start 5 at least good defenders. And then there's this year. Barnes is gone, Paul and Reddick are older, Blake's been out for like 40 (?) games, and the bench arguably got worse. AND YET, they are tied for the 6th best defense. How?

All these players were to me, the greatest players on earth. NOT ONCE, did I ever hear, ""We need to embrace them"". IF ANYTHING the only time I EVER heard such clamor was when Jordan came on to the scene. But it wasn't anything like Steph's situation. Stephen Curry will go down as the greatest shooter in history, and deservedly so. Steph is the game changer the NBA needs. I'm in awe whenever I get the chance to watch him.

Why are we paying guys based upon 82 games, and fans paying full price, and healthy guys are getting 'Maintenance' Days?’ I'm sorry.

Simple as that. The standard has been lowered and some fans are stupid enough to think this is acceptable. Let's just play guys for 70 of 82 games and see how fast they fight like crazy for their other 12 checks. Some might get miraculously healthy. A coach like Popovich should be fined to the max for this nonsense.If guys are injured, I totally respect them not playing. No way should they be expected to play. Fatigue? C’mon.

3218,nba,"During last nights game against the Warriors, Wizards coach Randy Wittman displayed, what I think, true genius that only the best of head coaches could pull off.To start the 4th quarter, Steph Curry and Draymond Green sat the bench. In fact, they sat until the 6:41 minute mark in that quarter. The Wizards were presented with a golden opportunity to claw back into the game against the Warriors, down by 7, 72-79, going into the 4th.Now, most would assume that a head coach would attempt to take advantage of Curry and Green sitting by running plays designed around Markieff Morris, John Wall, and Bradley Beal. And Wittman did, but after seeing Beal, Wall, and Morris miss a couple of unlucky shots, The mystical Playoff Wittman made a return. Wittman opted to instruct the Wizards to feed the ball to Nene in the post, and let who he must think is the reincarnation of Hakeem Olajuwon
go to work down low. The genius part of this move was Wittman knowing that Nene shoots an incredulous 58% from the free throw line, so GSW couldn't even hack him. Nene, it's safe to say, made the Warriors pay down low, making one shot out of four attempts, and missing five free throws out of eight. Out there against GSW, Nene looked like an MVP candidate, and had them running scared.The Golden State Warriors won 102-94.I, along with many other Wizards fans, feel blessed to have a basketball savant like Wittman as our coach, and so would many other teams in this league. Sarcasm aside... Yes, I know that the Wizards were not supposed to win this game. Yes, Steph and Klay had pretty average shooting games percentage wise. And yes, Wall, Beal, and Morris shot pretty bad percentages, so maybe a change of game plan was needed to come back into the game. However, is feeding the ball to the 33 year old, ghost of his former self Nene Hilario the answer when you have an All-Star like John Wall, a Maniac in Markieff, and Borderline All-Star when healthy and hopefully not Eric Gordon 2.0 Bradley Beal on the team? Maybe I'm alone on this, but I'd rather lose a game because my star players couldn't play like stars, rather than our bench Center's inability to carry us. Is what I'm saying crazy? Maybe. I don't know, I'm not a coach, I'm just some armchair analyst who happens to be a depressed Wizards fan. This is just some food for thought, and not good food either.

3471,nba,"UPDATE 3 on 3-18-16 3:33 EST:You guys are awesome! Here is an update on the transcription podcast. I am in touch with some guys working out of Berkeley, California. They're part of an incubator that is part of UC Berkeley, and are trying to solve difficult problems with technology and empower people.They showed me a demo video of how the transcription technology works - https://adagionode.herokuapp.com/?v=GvvH9gd1NjkThey also sent me a demo video for the BS Podcast, Ep. 74 - https://www.captiontree.com/?v=0B7YGByqif8The text is highlighted based on the dialogue at that particular time, so it really benefits millions of people with some type of hearing loss who can now just ""follow the bouncing ball"" and connect the text to the audio. This in turn helps them ""hear"" the dialogue clearly and makes it much easier for them to listen to and follow along on podcasts. For culturally Deaf people with no residual hearing, this technology still provides transcripts that they can just read without having to follow the dialogue at the same time. It's really cool stuff.
It seems like the software transcribes uploaded videos and podcasts, and then spits out a transcript. Volunteers would then go in and fix errors as needed, taking far less time needed than actually typing out the whole thing. So it would definitely be crowd sourced. I know I've said I'd much prefer the content producers felt obligated to provide the access to their readers/listeners/viewers, but this project could do wonders and allow podcasters a new audience of potentially millions more people with some degree of hearing loss who have difficulty with clearly hearing podcasts.Right now, I don't think anyone should go ahead and transcribe podcasts because I'm concerned about duplication efforts and all that. Once the project is up and about and fully in place, it would ensure no duplications occur and the work would be so much easier to complete. I'll be sure to update all of you when I learn more about the timeline.Thank you again for going ahead and typing the transcript. I greatly appreciated it and am touched!UPDATE 2 on 3-17-16 8:19 PM EST:A redditor contacted me and showed me a demo of a project that combines software with crowd sourcing for transcription, and I was floored. Having seen the idea in practice, I'm really excited for the potentials. I think millions of people with some degree of hearing loss will finally get to enjoy podcasts, good and crappy.  I'll be sure to update everyone after the project is finalized and ready for use. UPDATE on 3-17-16:Someone created a blogspot site at http://bstranscripts.blogspot.com/2016/03/bill-simmons-podcast-episode-76-chuck.html for the Klostermann transcript. Several other people also graciously sent me partial or full transcripts. I feel bad because I didn't update my post until two days later with this new information.However, I am asking that you guys not do this. I sincerely believe the onus is on the content producers to provide the transcripts, and it sends the wrong message to them that people not involved with the production can take care of the situation for the ones who SHOULD be involved with this work. Please don't do any of these, and thank you for the ones you did do!All I ask is you keep bugging Simmons, Lowe, Woj, and all the other prominent podcasters for them to provide transcripts for their podcasts. When they are getting these requests in response to every post they make on social media, I am hopeful that will be enough for the change I am hoping to see.And just on an aside, please don't feel the need to feel bad for me or pity me because I am Deaf. I LOVE BEING DEAF. If you gave me a pill tomorrow that would make me hearing again, I wouldn't take it. I repeat: I LOVE BEING DEAF. I have a wonderful job, an amazing wife, and twins that are due in early April. I don't know why I was given gold just for making an open letter to Bill Simmons. I'm not complaining, mind you, but I don't really want it if it's just because the people giving it to me felt bad for me. If this all comes off as being ungrateful, that's not my intention. I truly felt all of your warmth and compassion, and I'm thankful if you guys could do nothing more but constantly pester Simmons et al to provide transcripts for their podcasts.Dear Bill Simmons,You're my favorite sportswriter ever. I've been reading your content since before you joined ESPN. Then the podcast era began, and as a Deaf person, I had no way of accessing the auditory content. Almost 10 years ago, you included me in a mailbag when I asked for accessibility, and you apologized because ESPN would not be able to offer transcripts for your podcast, the BS Report. You explained that you did not have the power to change this at that time.When you broke off from ESPN, I sent you quite a few emails and comments on social media requesting that you look into a way to provide podcast transcripts for your millions and millions of Deaf and hard-of-hearing fans who cannot access your content. And still, nothing has happened.You're Bill freaking Simmons. If anyone can do it, it's you. When Bill Simmons starts providing transcripts for every podcast to his Deaf and hard-of-hearing fans, it's setting an example for everyone else to follow. This is basically my last resort. I know you glance at Reddit, so I'm gambling that you'll read this or someone close to you will send this to you. Or maybe Zach Lowe will see this, or somebody close to him in ESPN, who can get the ball rolling on this. I am an NBA die-hard, and it kills me every single time I see everyone talking about the latest Lowe podcast or the latest Simmons podcast, because the only way I can access the content is by looking through the comments on R/NBA related to those podcasts. It kills me. It's been almost 10 years since the podcast era began, and virtually nothing has been done regarding this accessibility issue. I'm begging for a response, Bill. Just give me something.

3482,nba,"There are plenty of differences between these teams, both material and imagined. Old vs. new, fast vs. slow, a winning tradition vs. a (formerly) losing legacy. One that persists is that San Antonio is a paint-oriented team, whereas the Warriors are a jump shooting team--thanks, Sir Charles. In reality, they take almost exactly the same amount of shots in the paint every game. Watching them, though, it’s obvious that that point doesn’t quite pass the eye test because the teams look so different playing. That’s because asking which team works in close-range is the wrong question. The right question is: how do the top two teams in the league get their close range points?Before moving forward, quick points: here, I’ve defined a “close range shot” as an attempt from 0-9ft, and made a couple of assumptions that while imperfect, shouldn’t be far off, like that most transition attempts will be in that range, as well shots taking by the roll man in an offensive possession. All stats were pulled from stats.nba.com on 3/25/2016 (this late in the season, there’s not likely to be significant shifts in per-game numbers anyway).The Spurs and the Warriors take pretty much the same amount of shots from 0-9 per game, and have generated just about the same number of touches in the paint  per game (TPG) over the season--37.5SPG and 16.9 versus 36.3 and 17.0, respectively. There are five types of plays I looked at that tend to happen inside that range offensively, checking the Spurs’ and the Warriors’ frequency and scoring efficiency for each: offensive post-ups, cuts, pick and rolls where the roll man is the handler, putbacks, and transition plays.Play Frequency and Scoring Efficiency, GSW and SAS tableThere are more than a few things that come out of these numbers that are interesting. For one, both teams get putback attempts on about 5% of offensive plays, ranking them at 8th (GSW) and 7th (SAS). However, there’s a huge gap in scoring efficiency. Golden State scores on less than half of putback attempts for .91 points per possession, while San Antonio converts two-thirds of theirs, good for 1.3 PPP. Looking at their offensive talent, it’s not particularly surprising. Tim Duncan and LaMarcus Aldridge are worlds ahead of Andrew Bogut and Festus Ezeli in terms of touch around the rim. Something else to note is that while San Antonio runs plays for the offensive roll man more often and likewise for cuts with Golden State, their effectiveness in both situations is a wash.What we’ll really want to look at here is the huge differences in two categories, post-ups and transition play.The post-up differences are interesting. Both teams produce a similar number of touches in the post every game: 22.1 for the Spurs (1st in the NBA) and 20.4 for the Warriors (good for 3rd in the league). The former just runs plays out of those touches far more often. San Antonio runs offensive post plays just over 14% of possessions, converting on just over 50% of them versus just 6.1% frequency and 40.0% for Golden State (1.00 vs. .91 PPP). The difference in frequency against touches is probably a product of Golden State’s bevy of shooters, resulting in quick passes to the perimeter out of the post more often. Not only is San Antonio more post-oriented, but they’re definitely more effective with it too. Again, not that surprising if you’re familiar with the build of their roster.Where the Dubs win big here is in transition. A whopping 17.5% of their offensive possessions occur in transition, versus just 10.9% for the Spurs. They have similar scoring frequency at a hair over 50%, but the much higher occurrence for the Warriors gives them 1.16 PPP against 1.07 PPP. Granted, this could be a bit stilted by their penchant for fast-break threes, but most of these possessions will still end within 10 feet of the basket. Again, given the personnel, not terribly surprising. The Warriors lead the league in pace, and everyone knows they like to run.This points to an interesting note from the most recent game, a defensive grinder that the Spurs won. Both teams defend well, with historic point differentials, but the Spurs are better. These teams define the “unstoppable force, immovable object” adage. If you want to know where those points the Spurs won by came from, a glance at defensive metrics gives us a look: their best offensive weapon up close is the post, and the Warriors are a pedestrian post-defense team, allowing a bottom-five amount of PPG in the post. The Spurs, by contrast, are a top-three transition defensive team--one of the Warriors’ biggest offensive weapons.
What does all of this mean? Mostly, it’s just numbers backing up some things that the eye test would allow us to guess anyway. Both teams are effective inside scorers, but they get those points in very different ways. It also tells us that maybe the way to beat the Warriors, beyond limiting the perimeter attack and transition, is to attack them in the post. Boasting some of the best talent in the league, there’s no question these titans will play great games every time. But under a microscope, the suspicion has serious material evidence: there’s no team as perfectly suited to defang Golden State as the Spurs. Come playoffs, maybe it’ll be enough. When the Warriors freight train comes to town, only time will tell if the Spurs end up more like Hancock or the kid from Stand By Me.",24,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/4cge14,[OC] How the Warriors and Spurs get their close-range points,"Dont lie, if you could play the Rockets you'd be happy as fuck",http://reddit.com/r/nba/comments/4cge14/c/d1hwpmf,120,7

3766,nba,"I tried posting this as a link yesterday, because I wasn't aware of r/nba's self promotion policies. After messaging the mods I hope this format works. I'm a big fan of the team building aspect of the NBA, so I'd like to see more content related to that on r/nba.I briefly mentioned in my last post that good teams have a tendency to find undervalued players from other teams’ rosters and turn them into reliable contributors. Great front offices find great value, while bad front offices overpay. Great coaching staffs get the most out of the talent on their rosters, while bad coaching staffs stifle a player’s development.In 2013 the Hawks gave Demarre Carroll a 2 year, $5 million dollar contract. He was a 26-year-old coming off a mediocre season in which he scored 6 ppg on .460/.286/.765. Hardly a scrub but far from a valuable contributor. Within two years Carroll was one of the premiere floor spacers and wing defenders, scoring 12.6 ppg on .487/.395/.702. His $2.5 million yearly salary was one of the best bargains in the NBA, and he was rewarded with a 4 year, $58 million salary the following offseason.When the Spurs signed Danny Green to a minimum contract in 2010, he was a bottom of the depth chart player He bounced between the Spurs and the D-league for a year and a half before becoming a solid contributor on the 2011-2012 Spurs, posting 9.1 ppg on .442./.436/.790. Now, four years later, he has been a key contributor on a championship team and is known as one of the best 3 and D players in the league. His 4 year, $40 million dollar contract signed last offseason was widely viewed as a huge bargain when compared to his open market value.Jae Crowder was an afterthought in the trade that sent Rajon Rondo to Dallas. The Celtics were getting two 1st round picks, a $12.9 million trade exemption, and two established players in Brandan Wright and Jameer Nelson. Who cared about the 23-year-old, tweener forward who couldn’t shoot or handle the ball? Danny Ainge obviously did. That tweener forward is now scoring 14.4 ppg on .450/.348/.825. He looks to be a major part of the Celtics’ plans going forward, and his 5 year, $35 million contract will be one of the best deals in the league for years to come.Contending teams absolutely have to find undervalued players that contribute heavily in order to compete. The NBA CBA allows teams to pay a maximum contract of anywhere from 25-35% of the salary cap based on how long that player has been in the league. Most contending teams have two or three maximum salary players. That's anywhere from 50-99% of your salary cap gone right off the bat. No team can win with two stars and a handful of minimum contracts. In order to navigate through this a team either needs maximum salary level players who make significantly below the max (Stephen Curry, Tim Duncan) or find these diamond in the rough, who make much less than they're worth.A good example of how this concept works is Iman Shumpert. Last year Shumpert was a bargain for the Cavs on his rookie deal of $2.6 million, but last offseason the Cavs gave him a bloated 4 year, $40 million contract, which they've been trying to fruitlessly unload ever since. His contract will hinder their ability to make trades and free agent signings for years to come. They would have been better off letting Shumpert walk in free agency and finding another undervalued wing player to come in and take his minutes.Who will be the next batch of players to come out of seemingly nowhere to make a major impact in the league? I decided to play GM and make a list of some players that I think could find success if put in the right situation.G E’Twaun Moore - BullsE’Twaun Moore has played really well in the absence of Jimmy Butler this year, putting up 7.6 ppg on .485/.451./.629. He’s an adequate defender, who hustles hard, and, if he keeps his hot shooting up, could turn into a valuable floor spacer. He hits free agency this offseason, and I think he could get paid. Look for him to get a contract in the $6-8 million range, which could be a good deal if he continues shooting so well.G Shane Larkin - NetsShane Larkin is playing a lot for a bad Nets team and is quietly establishing himself as a solid player. He’s undersized (5’11”, 175) for today’s NBA, but he is smarter than your average point guard. He has a great feel in the pick and roll, and has a knack for making the smart pass. He is also improving his shooting, putting up 6.7 ppg on .434/.344/.794. He has a player option for next season worth $1.5 million. If he declines, I’d look for him to get a contract in the $4-6 million range, which could turn into a bargain if he continues his development.F Darrell Arthur - NuggetsIt seems like Darrell Arthur has been in the NBA forever. However he’s only 27-years-old. Over his career he’s completely changed what kind of player he is and what role he plays. In the last three years he has exponentially increased the amount of threes he’s taken, and he is making them more often. Three years ago he took 18 threes and made 5 (.278). So far this year he has taken 81 and made 32 (.395). Floor spacing 4’s are more valuable now than ever, so look for Arthur to decline his player option for next year and sign a larger contract. He seems to constantly fly under the radar, so maybe a team can get him for cheap.G/F Jakarr Sampson - NuggetsJakarr Sampson reminds me a lot of pre-Atlanta Demarre Carroll. He’s a tall wing who currently can’t shoot, but hustles hard and plays good D. Teams like Atlanta, San Antonio, Miami, and Dallas seem to improve players’ shots easily, so if Sampson gets picked up by one of them, I’d expect him to improve quickly and become a valuable contributor. If I’m a GM who’s confident my coaching staff could improve his shooting, I’d give up a future 2nd rounder for him or wait for him to hit free agency and give him a small, “prove it” contract.G/F Quincy Pondexter - PelicansQuincy Pondexter has been a solid contributor on some good teams, but I think his ceiling is higher than that. I thought this year would be his coming out party as a solid starter, but Pondexter is out for the 2015-2016 season because of knee surgery. If he can come back full strength, I think his 3 year, $11 million dollar contract will be an absolute steal going forward. He can defend 2-4’s, and his career three point percentage is .365. His open market value (assuming he comes back full strength) would be huge because of the role he fills, which is similar to Carroll and Crowder.F Andrew Nicholson - MagicAndrew Nicholson has never gotten enough playing time. His per 36 numbers show a player who could score 14.1 ppg on .436/.333/.788, yet he is stuck playing 13.8 mpg. He’s a guy who can play in the post, stretch the floor, and rebound. This is the last year of his rookie contract, and he will be a restricted free agent at season’s end. He’d be a bargain at $5-8 million, and I doubt the magic would match.Hollis Thompson - 76ersOf everyone on this list, Hollis Thompson is my favorite. He’d be my top pick to follow the Carroll, Green, Crowder path and turn into a solid contributor for a good team. He puts up 9.1 ppg on .401/.383/.689. He’s not a great defender, but he can adequately guard 2-4’s and would probably be better on a team with another solid wing defender to take pressure off. He has a team option for the 2016-2017 season, which I’m sure the 76ers will pick up. If I was a GM, Thompson would be a top player I’d try to snag away from the 76ers as an afterthought in a bigger trade.F Quincy Acy - KingsMost NBA fans know Quincy Acy for his periodic highlight dunks, but there is more to him than that. Acy is developing a respectable jump shot, having hit 26 of his 79 three point attempts over the last two years (.329). He doesn’t get a lot of blocks, but he held opponents to just .452 shooting at the rim last year. Tim Duncan held opponents to .470, and DeAndre Jordan to .485. If he were to hit his ceiling, Acy could be an excellent 3 and D forward. Unfortunately Acy hasn’t displayed the highest basketball IQ over his career, but there’s hope a great coach, like Rick Carlisle, could fully utilize his unique skillset. Acy will hit free agency during the 2017 offseason. I think he will be available for the veteran minimum, so some lucky team could get a huge steal if they make good use of his talent.Here's a link to my blog, where I originally posted this article.https://robsorensensports.wordpress.com/2016/03/14/diamonds-in-the-rough-finding-the-nbas-next-jae-crowder/",30,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/4ak57q,Diamonds in the Rough: Finding the NBA's next Jae Crowder (OC),Shane Larkin is not the next Jae Crowder,http://reddit.com/r/nba/comments/4ak57q/c/d110p4z,31,2

3918,nba,"2 days ago, NBA commissioner Adam Silver appeared on ESPN's the Jump and described adding advertising to jerseys as ""Manifest Destiny"", the 19th century attitude toward expansion into the Western United States. It's an amazing (if not frightening) insight into how large corporations view profitable opportunities and no matter how slight he may try to make it seem, by using Silver's own logic, turning an NBA uniform into adspace will greatly impact how you and future generations view the sport.In the interview, Adam Silver makes two points about ads on jerseys...So to address 1., NBA owners are like most major business owners are interested in maximizing profit and Adam Silver is acknowledging that if the owners see another revenue stream, they are going to do it because their profit line is more important than anything else. The NBA is a business, their business.So, what's a little patch on your favorite teams jersey? Except how long will it be a small patch? If it works and owners come to the opinion that a larger patch would mean larger profits, then soon those ads are huge. You could say it's ""inevitable"". Anyone who has watched the premiere league recently knows how drastic jersey advertising can become.Putting ads on jerseys cheapens the NBA brand. Adam Silver is launching the first volley in a corporate sell off my favorite teams jersey and it won't end until my beloved Boston Celtics Uniform looks like trash. I cherish my team's identity and history and the uniform has been the constant that has tied the different generations together. I can't believe that the NBA is putting that identity up for sale and tying a fan's affection to another company's brand. What happens when one these giant corporations gets into a scandal or does something a team's fanbase doesn't agree with. I can ignore an ad on the side of a court but I can't ignore one on my favorite player. It's shoving more advertising at me during an age when I value every respite from being marketed to that I can find.TL:DR: I guess I just wished that the NBA owners respected the NBA brand as much as I did and left the jerseys alone.

4042,nba,"Though he single handedly murdered the Trailblazers last night, some may still be debating whether or not J.J. Redick should be a hall of famer. As a painfully biased J.J. fan, the choice is obvious, but to make the decision easier for you, I have hand-picked stats a la ESPN to make J.J. Redick look like what he truly is: the greatest player of all time.When it comes to discussions of who is the GOAT, two names are said most often: Michael Jordan and J.J. Redick. Though most would lean towards selecting MJ in this case, consider this fact: J.J. Redick’s teams have a 6-3 record when he shoots 100% from the field. Michael Jordan? 0-0. 
Jordan has not once shot 100% from the field, while Redick has done it 9 times. If that doesn’t make the case clear enough, how about this:J.J. Redick is the only player with 33 points, 7 3PM, 3 rebounds, 5 assists, 2 steals, and 1 turnover in under 32 minutes. Unprecedented. Many people are making the claim this season that Steph Curry is the greatest shooter of all time. That’s interesting, because J.J. Redick is the only player to score at least 40 points, while shooting 75% from 3 and 100% from the free throw line. Maybe Steph should hit the gym. Speaking of shooting perfect free throws, J.J. Redick has more career games in which he made all of his free throws (279) than Stephen Curry (261) and Kevin Durant (255). Thundersticks do not intimidate J.J. Redick.Many of the greats are praised for their ability to take their game to the next level on the road. Well J.J. is no different, as he is the last starter to score at least 26 points, make 5 threes, and record only 1 foul on 90% shooting on the road since Reggie Miller. No, I am not kidding you. Some NBA fans will agree that J.J. Redick is a great scorer, but cannot lead an offense like someone such as LeBron. Well these casuals better do their homework, because there are only two current NBA players to score at least 30 pts, on 90% 2pt shooting, with 8 FTA: J.J. Redick and LeBron James.Case closed. Doc Rivers should stop referring to the Clippers as having a “Big Three,” and instead should recognize he has an Enormous One.(This was part of an article I wrote for ChodeLeage.com.

Given the circumstances, Devin thought he should be allowed a little leeway in terms of where he was and wasn't supposed to be.He had never been to this part of the arena and was a little lost; he wandered around for a little while when an unexpected, yet completely familiar, voice spoke from behind him. ""Looking for me?""Devin turned around to see Kobe standing in the corridor, smiling in his usual Kobe way. Now that Devin was face-to-face with the man himself, he found himself starstruck. He swallowed. ""Yeah.""""It's better that we chat here. Fewer people,"" Kobe said. Devin nodded. He hadn't seen another person for several minutes until Kobe had appeared. The locker room he had been trying to locate was probably a long ways off. ""Yeah,"" he repeated. ""Man, it's crazy to think that you were playing in the NBA when I wasn't even born.""Kobe chuckled. ""Yeah, a little crazy.""""How do you do it? How did you stay so good for so long?"" Devin asked. ""And don't tell me about hard work, I know all about that.""Glancing around to reassure himself that nobody was around, Kobe leaned in a little closer. ""I can tell you, but it can't be out here.""There was a door to Devin's left. He was so eager to hear Kobe's words of wisdom that he didn't at all care what might be behind it; it turned out to be a mostly-empty janitorial closet. ""We could go in here,"" he suggested.""That works,"" Kobe said, shrugging. The two basketball players walked through the door and closed it behind them. A light switch was found and flipped on, illuminating the bare fluorescent bulb on the ceiling. ""Now, I'm only sharing my secrets because I think you're something special. Really special. Maybe the next Kobe."" Kobe chuckled again as he referred to himself in the third person.""I don't know about that,"" Devin replied bashfully.""Maybe you don't know now. But you will,"" Kobe said, adopting a serious tone of voice. ""Now listen up. The secret to my success is...""Devin was so focused on listening to Kobe's words that when Kobe's torso exploded outward, showering Devin with flecks of blood and bone, Devin could think of nothing except how he hadn't even gotten to hear the secret. He was soon brought back to reality by the sight of some sort of alien creature crawling out of the hole that had been created in Kobe's chest. Kobe, meanwhile, had fallen against the wall and lay slumped there, all life absent from his eyes.Devin backed as far away as he could. Somehow, in his surprise, it never occurred to him to simply open the door and leave. ""What are you?"" he asked, staring in repulsion at the three-foot-tall being who possessed four clawed legs and purple glasslike scales all across its body.""I am Kobe,"" answered the creature in a voice that seemed not to be transmitted through the air but instead inserted directly into Devin's auditory cortex. ""And if you want to be the next Kobe, you will allow me to use your body as a host.""""A...host?"" ""Kobe's body was failing. It could no longer support me,"" explained the alien, who did not seem to have eyes or a head to speak of. ""Your body is young and fresh.""""What if I don't want to host an alien in my body?"" Devin asked defiantly.There was the briefest of pauses before the alien replied, ""that's not really an option."" With frightening quickness, it leaped off the floor with two of its legs extended outward, obviously intending to pin Devin against the wall. Devin instinctively ducked, rolled, and ran to the opposite corner, near where Kobe's sundered body lay motionless.As the alien recovered its footing, Devin looked desperately around him for anything that might help him. Spotting a jug of bleach, he removed the cap and splashed some of the strong-smelling liquid on the creature. The effect was immediate, and the closet was filled with the sound of glass shattering as the creature's scales turned a violet red color before breaking and falling off.""You will die for your resistance!"" announced the creature, who again launched itself at Devin, this time connecting with the human's chest. Devin cried out in pain as he felt his lung punctured by a needle-pointed alien claw, but he overcame the pain to toss some more bleach on the exposed, scaleless areas of the alien's skin.""No! Fool! Do you not want to be the next Kobe?"" screamed the alien as it fell to the ground and shuddered, clearly mortally wounded.""Yo, you learn a lot from Kobe?"" asked a teammate as Devin walked back into the locker room.Devin wiped a spot of blood off his face.

4109,nba,"Lets dispel once and for all with this fiction that LeBron James is no longer an elite defender, and is not having a stellar defensive season this year. I know the more informed among us are already aware, but lately I’ve seen an alarming number of misguided NBA fans making this assertion after the narrative shift stemming from last year’s campaign and to an extent, from his final year with the Heat as well. I want to set the record straight. LeBron is currently the second most impactful SF defender in the league, after Kawhi Leonard.  It appears that LeBron has decided, whether due to health, mentality, coaching, or otherwise, to buckle down this season and get back to being an every night force on the defensive end. This isn’t to say he doesn’t take possessions off, but rather to say that his consistency and effectiveness is much improved from the last two seasons. Lets take a look at the numbers with Kawhi as a reference point, based on all the decent individual defensive statistics I could scrounge up across BBref, NBA.com, and ESPNs rpm chart. LeBron 8.3 DFGA, 37.5 DFG% for a -7.3 FG diff%, #1 for Forwards3pt DFGA: 1/3.2 (31.3%, -3.4 diff%) 2pt DFGA: 2.1/5.1 (41.2%, -7.7 diff%)DBPM: 2.1 #3 for SFsDRPM: 2.45 #2 for SFsD Win Shares: 3.6 #3 for SFs (team related)Kawhi9.4 DFGA 39.4 DFG% -5.3 diff% #4 for Forwards3pt:1/2.8 (34.8%, -.2 diff%)2pt:2.7/6.6 (41.4% -7.3 diff%)DBPM:2.7 #2 SFDRPM:4.60 #1 SFD Win Shares:5.2 #1 SF (team related)As you can see, LeBron’s individual defense is stellar. He forces his matchup to shoot over 7% worse than their average per game, including 10% worse from inside of 6 feet (not shown). As opposed to Kawhi, he won’t usually guard away from his position, but when it comes to opposing star SFs, we’ve seen him take the challenge multiple times this year vs. Melo, KD, Kawhi, and PG. His other metrics lag behind Kawhi by either 1 or two spots, and (trigger warning) I’d be personally interested to see what his DRPM would look like if the Cavs had a rim protector of Duncan’s caliber and/or didn’t play with Love and Kyrie most of the time.  I do think one thing is clear here, however: LeBron is no slouch, only lagging behind the reigning DPOY in defensive impact at the Small Forward position. In the playoffs, he’ll be tasked with toeing the fine line between playing more desperate defense (i.e. fouling more, blocking more shots, not taking possessions off) and conserving energy for the offensive burden he carries. Last year’s Finals were a case of him needing to do everything, which impacted his defense and his shooting percentages. As his quickness and stamina wane with age, it will be interesting to see how he maintains in the seasons to come, but for the moment, he remains elite in every interpretation of the word.

4245,nba,"Hey fellas, idk if anyone gives a shit about this at all, and the beginning part is a little dumbed-down, but here's a homework assignment/project I did that I figured I might as well post to /r/nba. Here goes.   As the seasons go on, LeBron James keeps making his case for being one of the top players in NBA history. ""Experts"" at ESPN voted LeBron as the third best player of all time, behind Kareem Abdul-Jabbar at #2 and Michael Jordan at #1. While there will always be skeptics, if LeBron James was able to surpass Michael Jordan and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar in scoring, it would certainly help his legacy. LeBron currently sits at #13 on the NBA's all time scoring list with a total of 26,455 total points, while Michael Jordan is 4th with 32,292 total points, and Kareem is number one all time with a grand total of 38,387 points. What I want to find out is if LeBron could surpass either Jordan or Kareem, and how long it would take him to do so. I decided to do this using a linear regression model.  There are a few factors to consider:  LeBron has played 62/65 games this year. There are 17 games left in the season. Because LeBron is currently averaging 24.9 points per game, I chose to multiply that by 17 and add it to his total points for this year. However, he might not play all the remaining games due to injury or rest, and will likely not continue to average exactly 24.9 points per game.  No one can play forever. Most players will play to around 40 at the most. With all the extra playoff, olympic, and all star games LeBron participates in, he ends up playing a lot more than most players. I can't imagine even an incredible athlete like LeBron playing past forty, so I am making that the limit for how long he can play when making these calculations.  While a linear regression equation should be able to make a relatively accurate prediction of how much LeBron will decline, it won't know there were only 66 games played in the 2012 season due to a lockout, which might affect the prediction.  There are a number of things that can happen with LeBron that the linear regression model simply can't predict. LeBron could become a better shooter, be affected by injuries, or have a new role with a team, all of which would likely affect his point totals.The linear regression model gives us an equation of y=2105.620879X-4217537.89.  I first decided to plug in Michael Jordan's point total into Y because it is the smaller value. It predicts LeBron could reach Jordan's point total in 2018, which is when LeBron will only be 33, so unless something drastic happens, he should pass Jordan.     Next, I plugged in Kareem's point total. The linear regression equation gives us the year of 2021 for when LeBron should pass Kareem. LeBron would only be 36 then, so passing Kareem should certainly be doable as well.    Conclusion(TLDR): Unless something changes, LeBron James should be able to pass Michael Jordan and overtake Kareem's top spot in all-time scoring for the NBA.Sources: http://espn.go.com/nba/player/stats/_/id/1966/lebron-james, http://www.basketball-reference.com/leaders/pts_career.htmlHere's an actual picture of lelbron i put at the endedit: all the numbers are ones and idk why",31,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/4ab9sd,Could LeBron James become the NBA's all time leading scorer?

Props to Derrick for changing his game and still being a good player. Why I have serious faith in DRose:1) He had an excellent series against the Cavs (not just the game winning buzzer beater) until he hurt his wrist and had an entire off-season to get better, which he said he would work the hardest he would ever work since getting into the league.2) He absolutely took over against KD and Westbrook's Thunder earlier in the season when he hit stepback after stepback after bank shot to put away the game.3) He played with limited/blurred vision for the first part of the season. Consequently his depth perception and everything else would be hindered, making him rely on bank shots even more so and limiting his jump shooting/etc.4) He always steps ups his game when faced against an elite PG. He put Kyrie on multiple spin cycles last year, torched Westbrook this year, etc.I love this guy. I love how humble he is. It's so interesting to me how people hate on him for the smallest things. I love that he hit game winners against both teams in the finals last year. More so I love that amidst the doubt and criticism his drive and love for the game never wavered.

The window for Chicago isn't closed, looking forward to see what you do in the playoffs and the years coming.Please notice I never said anything about him being MVP Rose, being back, or being in MVP form, or anything of the variation.

4971,nba,"The race at the top of the West is pretty much locked in - barring a collapse by GS, they'll end up with the #1 seed, and the Spurs are already guaranteed at least #2. OKC has enough distance on the Clippers to more or less call them at #3 and #4 at this point. Even Memphis is all alone in the #5 spot, 3.5 games behind LAC and 4.5 ahead of Portland.The real race in the West this season is for spots #6-9. Today's standings are:One of these teams will get to avoid the Warriors and Spurs in the 1st round, and take their chances against OKC. One of these teams won't make the playoffs at all. The other two teams won't be so lucky.ProjectionsSo who is likely to make the cut? Here are short breakdowns of their remaining games:*Projected wins are based on point spreads of remaining games, which take into account both home/away splits and remaining opponents.PortlandLikely wins: vs 76ers, vs Kings, at Kings, vs Timberwolves, vs NuggetsLikely loss: at WarriorsTossups: vs Celtics, vs Heat, vs ThunderMy money would be on Portland to finish strong, with all but two of their games at home. UtahLikely wins: at Timberwolves, vs Lakers, vs Timberwolves, at Suns, at Nuggets, at LakersLikely losses: vs Warriors, vs Spurs, vs ClippersTossups: vs MavericksUtah has a great shot at getting into the playoffs again for the first time since 2012 - but while their remaining road schedule is forgiving, their home games are not.HoustonLikely wins: vs Bulls, vs Suns, vs Lakers, at Timberwolves, vs KingsLikely losses: at Pacers, at CavaliersTossups: vs Raptors, vs Thunder, at MavericksHouston gets the edge over Dallas by virtue of a more favorable home/away split, plus winning the head to head tiebreaker - they currently lead 2-1 in the series, but if they lose in Dallas, they will still likely have a better division record.DallasLikely wins: at Kings, at Nuggets, vs Knicks, at TimberwolvesLikely losses: at Warriors, at Clippers, vs SpursTossups: at Pistons, vs Rockets, vs Grizzlies, at JazzDallas has one of the toughest schedules left in the league, with only 4 home games to 7 road games - and the home games aren't easy, with division games against Houston, Memphis, and San Antonio.Bonus round: Tiebreakers!Portland is likely not to need it, but they own the tiebreaker against Utah 3-1. They're tied with Houston 2-2, but currently have an edge in conference record, 25-21 to 24-22. They actually lose their tiebreak against Dallas, 1-2.As mentioned above, Houston is guaranteed a tiebreaker against Dallas, as they can do no worse than split the season series, and unless the Mavs win out against all three of the Rockets/Grizzlies/Spurs, Houston will have a better division record.Houston has already split the season series with Utah, 2-2, which means the better conference record wins - currently Houston has the edge, 24-22 vs 19-23 for Utah.The tiebreaker between Dallas and Utah depends entirely on the outcome of their remaining game. They only play 3 games this season, and are tied 1-1, so the Apr. 11 game Mavs at Jazz will be the decider.Also, who doesn't like 3-way ties? If Utah, Houston, and Dallas all end up with the same record, the head to head to head matchup matters first. If Houston loses their last game against Dallas, they'll be 4-4 against the others. Whoever wins the Mavs at Jazz game will be 4-3, and take the #7 spot - the loser will be 3-4, and out of the playoffs at #9, while Houston is #8. Alternatively, if Houston beats Dallas in their game, they'll take #7, and the Mavs at Jazz game will decide #8 and 9.",23,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/4bxwx6,The playoff race out West,A small part of me wants to see the Nuggets take the 8th seed from the Rockets for some season ending dramatic irony. ,http://reddit.com/r/nba/comments/4bxwx6/c/d1dgkmq,53,7

5010,nba,"Some of you might remember my post from last season on my new stat: NBA Passer Rating. Passer Rating is a measure of the net value, in points, added to a team by 100 of a given player's passes.The stat was created to get a clearer picture on the value of a player's passes; while assist numbers are heavily influenced by a player's role and level of ball dominance, Passer Rating is not. You can read more about it in last year's post, but here is a breakdown of how it is calculated.The formula has the following inputs:Total Passes (TP)Assists (AST)Free Throw Assists (FTA)PTS created by Assists + FT Assists  (PTSc)Bad pass turnovers (PTOV)Expected Value of Possession (EVP) = Average points of an NBA possession = 1.062Expected Value of a Possession after a turnover (EVP-T) = 1.140The stat is calculated by determiningValue Added By Passing = PTSc / 100 TP - (AST + FTA)*EPVThis formula determines the total number of points created by a player's assists per 100 passes, minus the expected value of all the possessions those assists ended. The difference is the value, in points, that 100 of a players passes add to his team. Value Lost By Passing = PTOV / 100 TP x EVP-TThis simply determines the expected value lost by 100 of a player's passes due to foregoing a possession, plus the additional value lost defensively on the next possession.Passer Rating = Value Added By Passing - Value Lost By PassingHere are your top 10 overall, and by position.

5081,nba,"Question is as in the title. Likewise how harmful is a bad coach on a teams record? Any comments, examples, links to previous analysis etc post away. Also, how exactly did you get to whatever number you got to is worth thinking about. We can make this discussion either the impact of a good coach vs a replacement level coach or a good coach vs an awful coach. Whichever one you want to post about. My estimation: The best coaches are probably worth say 7 wins a year above replacement. In some instances, like Pop in San Antonio, maybe you could push that closer to 9-10 but those are very specific instances. IF you put some god awful coach in San Antonio, my best guess is they go from 70 wins to say 54 and go from a real threat to the Warriors to being a step behind OKC and barely above the Clippers in the playoffs. Perhaps the most youll ever see a coach influence a team is Mark JAckson vs Steve Kerr but a big part of that was also luck to some extent as Kerr will be the first person to tell you he never intended on starting Draymond Green initially. I do think bad coaches might be more detrimental. This is especially true for a very bad coach on what's a talented roster.

5551,nba,"So I'm a big clippers fan. I watch every minute of every game so I think I  have a pretty good feel for the team. Early last year (or maybe a year before) Bill Simmons suggested that the clippers would be a better team if they traded Blake for 3 decent guys. I laughed that off. Blake is a legit MVP candidate. He can pass, score inside and out, can defend on the ball and on switches. He is a super player, but he might not be the best fit. When CP3 went down last season we got to see the best of Blake. He was simply amazing, and the best player in the league during that stretch. Now this season Blake is out and we get to see how CP3 plays without him. They are playing great, but stylistically the offense is completely different. Its almost unrecognizable. Lets look at the differences. 1.
 With Blake out almost every on ball screen is set by DJ. I didn't appreciate this until this season but he is a much better screener than Blake. Like, a lot. Blake tends to set wussy screens and pop out half the time. Obviously Blake is great as the roll man with his touch inside and athleticism, but it doesn't always help CP. When DJ screen he screens hard. He sticks out those hips just enough to not get called, smashes the opposing guard off balance and freaking bolts for the rim. I mean some of those lob dunks are simply ridiculous. So what is the difference? Its all about spacing. The NBA is moving towards a style of pick and roll with 3 shooters. The Clippers certainly do this an awful lot, and with only one big on the floor, the opposing rim protector has to come out and help on those picks otherwise CP3 will totally burn them. You can't do that with two bigs who aren't a threat from 3. The result is the Clippers have a go to play: CP3/DJ pick and roll at the elbow. CP turns the corner as DJ's man contains. If he helps too much DJ puts on the jets and its a dunk. If they contain well CP3 will turn the corner, snake across the top of the key and shoot that little left to right fader he is so good at, or they get a switch/other action. Its a fool proof way to set up the offense or get a decent look late in the clock. If you trade Blake for a package with a shooter at the 3 and 4, you have a mean pick and roll.I present to you, trade option 1! Ok these trades are not super realistic but its the trade the Clippers should try and get in my opinion. Milsap is a natural 3 in my opinion and Horford prefers the 4. They are both great defenders, they both play really well without the ball. They are both great players. The cap is going up so you can afford to sign them both to bigger deals if need be. The starting lineup of CP3, Reddick, Milsap, Horford, DJ is simply scary. Would be the best starting 5 in the league probably. This kinda relies on both guys walking in free agency, and Blake agreeing to resign if he goes to atlanta. Both guys are a bit older but they are well withing the CP3 window. Atlanta gets a young star to go with some of their up and comers. 2.
I was said to see coach Lue go and I was skeptical about Woodson coming in to oversee the defense. DJ is an amazing presence in the paint. He is quick enough to help and get back to his man, rediculous shot changer/blocker. Opposing teams hated this so they would put him in the P&R and leave Blake to gaurd the rim. Blake is quite frankly a huge failure of a paint protector so they tried to get away from this. The new system designed for this season was to have the guards help out on DJ's man rolling, and there are a few switches but everyone else ends up on a man while DJ gets to sit in the paint. This forces opponents to cough up bad midrange shots or contested 3s. The problem is this requires immense trust and the knowledge that if you leave your guy the system will cover you. It took ages for this to click and I was skeptical but now it has Holy Shit Batman its a thing of beauty. The clips are now a top 5 defense and top 2 in recent months. Blake is not a great defender. On defending the post he is above average (last time I checked) and he is pretty good trying to guard the perimeter on switches. This is all fine. Unfortunately he is in the same category as Kevin Love: they both just get lost in defensive action. Blake tries to buy in but he just notices things too slowly, or over commits. He hedges too high, gets lost in the pick and roll and his defensive rebounding is down (though this is Doc Rivers idea to keep Blake healthy in the regular season, in the playoffs he is great on the boards). I am always a fan of defense first guys to compliment super stars. Especially 3 and D guys.So here is number 2. Really this trade is BG for Crowder and Bradley and someone else. Then chuck in some throw away contracts or picks to balance it out. The vision here is to make the clips into a defensive Juggernaut. If you can get away with Bradley at the 3 (ie not on Lebron, KD, Melo, or PG) you have a super fun defensive lineups. You can predict a heap of steals with this lineup and it would produce a heap of fast break points off tunrovers. Jae Crowder is one of my favorite players (Behind Lance RIP :{ ) and super underrated. Probably Cs best player. Bradley is becoming Reddick MKII. He runs around like a bloody mad man on set plays and gets open. I would be fun to have action where they both run off down screens and the defense has to just gamble and cover one of them.

5642,nba,"Let me preface this by saying that I haven't paid any attention to basketball for many years now. Football is now my sport.  But back in my day, John Stockton was the man. You may laugh at me. Be my guest. He is famous for his short shorts, after all. He is a white man who played in perhaps the ""whitest"" state ever: Utah. He was nowhere near as flashy as Jason ""White Chocolate"" Williams.   He wasn't a prolific scorer, because that wasn't his job. But with a career (19 seasons!) shooting percentage of .515, he scored seemingly at will. I remember he started off every game by driving for an easy deuce. He couldn't blaze passed most defenders. Rather, he used his body control masterfully to avoid the block while also jumping off his non-dominant leg on occasion.  He was clutch. Ice Man. Not just through scoring but also defending, passing, and rebounding. This clip illustrates this point perfectly. I also remember Stockton taking over games in the exciting Utah-Sacramento playoff series. Let's not forget Game 6 of the Western Conference Finals that sent the Jazz to their first ever NBA Finals. There were games where it seemed his point total came from the 4th quarter alone.  But it was his facilitation prowess that drew me to him. Stockton had the quickest, softest hands in the League. This served him well on both sides of the court. Combine this with elite court vision, you have a quietly lethal point guard. This point is seen in the above video where he snatches the rebound, dribbles once, then drops the ball nearly cross-court in The Mailman's bread basket in one smooth motion. Malone catches the ball in stride and over his shoulder as if it was a pass from Montana to Rice. Look at any Stockton highlight video, and you'll see him using the bounce pass masterfully. Often times, he was so quick with his passing that his nor his teammate's defender had any time to react.  So you may be wondering why I'm posting this. Well, friendo, it is John Stockton's birthday today. This is just my way of paying tribute to a man whom I had deep admiration and appreciation for in my young buck days. He was just a quiet man who did his job.  Happy Birthday, John Stockton",30,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/4c37jk,To a fine PG," passer ever.

5653,nba,"At first glance, it may appear that the Western Conference, with all its superstar (All-NBA) players, is far better than the Eastern Conference. After all, they have the 2 best teams in the NBA and 4 of the top 6. However, when you take a deeper look something quickly becomes apparent: the Eastern Conference has just as many (if not more) quality teams as the Western Conference.Even though the West is on pace to have 4 teams finish the season with 50 or more wins, as opposed to the East's 2 teams, the East is on pace to have all 8 of its playoff teams finish the season well above .500. The same cannot be said for the West, however; they are on pace to have two teams at or below .500 make the playoffs. The last time the West had two or more playoff teams at or below .500 make the playoffs was 1996-97 (back when the West's bottom 3 seeds all had losing records), nearly 20 years ago.With the Golden State Warriors and San Antonio Spurs both having historic seasons in the West, of course the lower playoffs seeds will be worse off (side-note: This very well may be the first season in NBA history where two teams in the league, let alone the same conference, both finish the season with winning percentages above .800)! Besides, West teams are still beating the East teams, right?As I am typing this, East teams are a combined 205-220 (.482) against West team. Inversely, West teams are a combined 220-205 (.518) against East teams. With over 94% of inter-conference games already played, it's likely that the win percentage margin between the East and the West stays below 2% (the largest margin possible at this point is 4.4%). Wherever this margin falls in the 0-4.4% range, it'll be the lowest since 2008-09 When the East (231-219, .513) and the West (219-231, .487) had a win percentage margin of about 2.67% in the East's favor.Now that we've seen how the all combined teams in each conference compare to another, let's focus on individual teams, more specifically playoff teams. There are currently 9 teams in the East with a record at or above .500 vs. the West (Cavs, Raptors, Hawks, Heat, Celtics, Hornets, Pacers, Pistons, Bulls), including all 8 playoff teams. Moving to the West, there are currently 7 teams in the West with a record at or above .500 vs. the West (Warriors, Spurs, Thunder, Clippers, Grizzlies, Jazz, Nuggets), only 6 of which are playoff teams.With all the information I have presented above, I hope we redditors can have a meaningful discussion on the state of the two NBA conferences.

5676,nba,"MJ's Wizards tenure is seen by many as somewhat of a blemish on his unparalleled legacy. On september 25th 2001, at the age of 38 and 7 months, the GOAT announced his second comeback as a member of the Washington Wizards - just a few months after he broke a couple ribs during a pickup game in Chicago. After winning just 19 games the previous season, the Wizards were off to a lousy start, being 5-12 and going on a terrible 8 game losing streak before hitting their stride and winning 9 in a row. Unfortunately, 8 games into the streak Rip Hamilton - the Wizards 2nd best player at this point - would suffer a groin injury and would miss about 5 weeks and the Wizards would end up going 8-9 without him. Immediately following Hamilton's return on January 31st, the 21-21 Wizards would go on a 5 game winning streak - things were looking up. The Wizards had won their last 13 games that had both MJ and Hamilton on the court. Unfortunately the 38 year old Jordan was battling a chronic knee injury 1 2 3 that was aggravated in a collision with Etan Thomas in his 46th game which effectively ended his season - though he tried to play through it for several games. Immediately after the injury the 26-21 (.553 winning % .565 with Jordan) Wizards would go 1-9 in their next 10 games and 11-24 (a .314 winning %) for the remainder of the season and would finish with a 37-45 record and MJ would only end up playing a total of 60 games.Now, out of curiosity I decided to take a look at MJ's game logs for the season, specifically pre and post-injury and as the season advanced, and what I found out was quite interesting. For the whole 2001-02 season, Jordan averaged :22.9 PPG 5.7 RPG 5.2 APG .416 FG% .790 FT% However, for his first 46 (pre-injury) games, he averaged:25.1 PPG 6.2 RPG 5.3 APG .420 FG% .790 FT% in 36.8 MPGAnd his last 14 (post-injury) games, he averaged:15.7 PPG 3.8 RPG 4.8 APG .391 FG% .787 FT% in 28.4 MPGWhat I found most interesting though is that as the season progressed and MJ played himself into shape and shook off the 3 year retirement rust - he was playing better and better.For his last 20 games pre-injury he averaged :27.5 PPG 6.4 RPG 5.2 APG .440 FG%And for his last 10 games pre-injury he averaged a blistering :29.7 PPG 6.6 RPG 6.1 APG .470 FG%Those are some crazy, crazy numbers for a dude who at this point was a month or two away from being 39 years old. Had Jordan and Hamilton both stayed healthy I honestly believe the Wizards might've won 48-50 games and made some noise in the playoffs on the back of a fucking 39 year old. Amazing.The Wizards went from having won 19 games the year before to a potential Playoff contender that was derailed by injuries with their offseason additions being:38,5 year old Michael Jordan - ended up only playing 60 games and starting 53 due to injuryTyronn Lue - 20 mpg, 8 PPG 3.5 APGRookie Kwame Brown - 14 mpg, 4.5 PPG 3.5 RPGRookie Brendan Haywood - 14 mpg, 5 PPG 5 RPGRookie Etan Thomas - 13 mpg, 4 PPG 4 RPGRookie Bobby Simmons - 11 mpg, 4PPG 2RPG",33,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/4alpmz,A look at Michael Jordan's 2001-02 season,!RemindMe 12 years.,http://reddit.com/r/nba/comments/4alpmz/c/d11h8ts,162,0

5967,nba,"I've been watching NBA games consistently for over a decade, and for a long time I've had this lingering belief that the quality of today's players are better than it's ever been. When I hear old-timers like Oscar Robertson dismiss today's players as ""soft"" and ""not understanding the game"".....I'm forced to actually go back and do research on how these old-school players played the game. And I have no doubt in my mind that the quality of today's NBA players is much much higher than it was in any time in history. Today's players can shoot better, pass better, dribble much better, are far more athletic, play offensive and defensive schemes which would leave any 1980's player absolutely flummoxed, and they play far better defense. With the advancement of zone defense, you now have multiple weak side defenders rotating to fill any gaps that exist between the player with the ball and the hoop, making it MUCH harder to score in today's league. Hence why NBA scoring levels are much lower today than the 1980's. Nowadays in today's NBA, you're considered an offensive liability if you can't shoot the 3-Pointer. Nowadays, you have stretch 4's and even stretch 5's who can not only aggressively rotate in guarding perimeter players, but are expected to have relatively deep range as well as being a low-post threat. Now I'm not disrespecting players like Moses Malone or Magic Johnson or any of these Hall-of-Famers. I'm just stating that there's no way that a player from that era would be as effective today as he was back then. We need to speak the blunt truth and look at the overall quality of today's offense and defense. And for those who think otherwise, I recommend that you search for 1980's NBA Finals games on YouTube. I just recently watched every game of the 1984 and 1987 NBA Finals (Bird vs Magic)....and I compared the quality of their play to the NBA of today. It isn't even close. Watch every single minute of every game of those series, the so-called ""golden era of NBA Basketball"" and the talent level does not scratch the surface of today's elite players. Ignore the hard fouls and the trash-talking and the near fights. Look at the actual gameplay and the difference is like night and day. Today's players have the benefit of advanced training, physical therapy, better nutrition, better coaching, and far better competition. And with the influx of International NBA stars, especially from Europe, you're going to have an overall much higher level of competition. Michael Jordan was being guarded by the likes of Craig Ehlo. Ehlo wouldn't even be able to start in today's league. And this is no disrespect to him, but we should acknowledge that comparing players across different eras is a futile exercise. I don't see any serious person arguing that a player like George Mikan or Bob Cousy could thrive in today's league. So why is the exception being made for 1980's NBA players? How could anyone not look at a player like LeBron James and not objectively conclude that he was far more talented (when it comes to pure skill) than the elite players of that era? Now obviously there are players who could transcend any era (ie. Jordan, Bird, Magic, Olajuwon, etc.), but if we are going to make comparisons between contemporary NBA players and players of the past, then we should at least put them in their context. If LeBron James or Russell Westbrook were put in a time machine and sent back to 1985, then they would be even MORE dominant than they are today. And I just can't see how this isn't obvious to more people.TODAY is the golden era of NBA Basketball. Be objective, and don't be misguided by your nostalgia.P.S. And to those people who will inevitably say ""Today's NBA is soft, LeBron could be manhandled by those Bad Boy Pistons"".....you have to acknowledge the fact that LeBron is far stronger and more imposing than any ""Bad Boy Piston"" and could hold his own in a physical match-up against any of them. But this is basketball, and I'm not buying tickets to watch NBA players beat each other up in the paint. That isn't good defense, that's not good basketball, and it just further proves my point that this era is far superior to any other era of basketball. And I'm not even saying this as a LeBron fan. I don't even like the guy, my favorite player has always been Tim Duncan, but I'm acknowledging talent when I see it.

Or a total of 97,965,713Haslem probably retires or comes back on a minimum deal so his hold can be waived. Bringing the commited amount down to 94,797,762.So to sign Whiteside to a 4/85m deal ( his max is 4yr/96m gave heat a little discount)  they would need 19,101,123 in capspace. Meaning with a 92m cap they would need to clear down to 72,898,877 (or lose 21.89m).This can be done multiple waysA) sign both wade and Deng for a combined 21,841,681B) sign only one of wade or Deng for a max of 21,298,210Now getting lebron/wade/Whiteside is near impossible.

6347,nba,"I’m going to HIGHLY HIGHLY recommend trying Imagus browser extension before reading. I got it from the streamables tool page and it plays streamables with a mouse hover over the link. Shit’s awesome. WHAT THE HELL IS RUDY GOBERT? a collaboration between /u/Skiptomyl0u and /u/Fatal_conceit The albatross of the NBA. With a wingspan longer than that of Wilt Chamberlain, front offices across the league regret shooting him down on draft night (27th pick!), and now he hangs around their necks like a curse. And between the 7ft 8 and ½ inches of ball smothering terror flails he calls arms, is a man whose frame betrays the human eye. The age of the mobile bigs is upon us, and the French Rejection, the Stifle Tower, Rudy Gobert, is as big as they come.  DEFENSEIn the era of /u/splash2ndcousin streamables, players are more weary than ever to avoid embarrassment, and for rim protectors getting posterized is the height of embarrassing mishaps. Seriously, how many times do you see a big man take a casual step out of the way of a hard driving guard on a late rotation? But that’s not Rudy. On March 30th Andrew Wiggins posterized Rudy. Badly. Twice. But rather than check out and keep his head down, Rudy is the kind of guy with the mindset that the paint is his not yours, and every attempt at entering his home is done at your own peril. It takes a special temperament to be this even-keeled and along with his temperament comes a defensive IQ that allows him to really anchor the defense in ways that reflect well in both simple stats and advanced analytics. A prime example of this is Rudy’s ability to alter shots, leaving shooters at a league low 40% FG against. If you don’t immediately recognize how batshit crazy that statistic is, it tells you that having Ricky Rubio launch three pointers is a more efficient scoring strategy than attacking Gobert at the basket. Combined with his length and speed he is an absolute nightmare on the court. He has length that can help deny entry passes, a high defensive BBIQ, good elevation, and incredible [footwork] for a guy his size. And with Rudy’s defense, comes seemless transitions into offense. Oh yeah and rebounds… he’s snagging 11 of those bad boys down a game. OFFENSERudy Gobert is more than just your average garbage man. For sure he is an elite lob target. For sure his putbacks are nasty. For sure he is a terrible shooter air ball. But today’s game is about efficiency not pure volume, and for Rudy good decision making leads him to a very high 60% eFG. And while his free throws are good enough to avoid some of the monotony of end game fouling that plagues the loyal fans of Drummond and Deandre, there isn’t a lot of bragging room for a 59% shooter. Rudy has good vision for Slenderman. However, he also has poor hands whenever any pass comes below his waist and with a whopping  turnover percentage of 18.1%, he gives the opposing team ample opportunities themselves. But if he can tighten some of these errors up I think he flashes some serious potential as a passer. It’s not every day you see big men with this kind of awareness in a big man and combined with an insanely high vantage point Quinn Snyder may be tapping into something special. But if all else fails, Rudy can always just dunk it in your face. /u/Fatal_conceit : Despite just starting his career, Rudy has made a game of destroying the league's top tier talent. For example, if you played on the All-Star team this year and haven’t been hurt for a significant part of Rudy’s career, he has probably swatted your shit. Also Kobe told me Rudy Gobert is the reason he's retiring early.   TL;DR: Rudy is a young freak of defensive nature. He has a ton of room to grow offensively and he has a bright future on a young Utah team.

He's been more entertaining than anything else due to his behavior and plays like this one.Tony Allen - ""First-Team All-Defense!"" Kobe called him the ""best defensive player I ever faced"" but he didn't mention his atrocious offense. A big reason the Warriors beat the Grizzlies last year was because Kerr basically decided to put two guys on Marc Gasol and ignore Tony. Allen shot all he wanted and made no impact. Which is why he should never lead the team in scoring.Vince Carter - Former ""half-man half-amazing"" and heart of Canada basketball, the last time he was relevant was the 2000 Olympics with the greatest dunk ever.Mario Chalmers - Only in Memphis to help Miami get under their luxury tax. Won a couple championships with Lebron but averaging less than ten points per game this year.Ryan Hollins - 50th overall pick in the 2006 NBA draft and has drifted around since then. The Grizzlies signed him to two ten-day contracts earlier this year before signing him after Marc Gasol was injured (more on that later).Jarell Martin, P.J. Hairston, JaMychal Green - Rookies and near-rookies who have spent more time in the D-League than anywhere else. Joerger hates playing young players like God hates sin.Who was injured: Marc Gasol (2014 All-Star, out for season), Mike Conley (starting point guard, shoulder), Zach Randolph (starting point forward, knee), Chris ""Birdman"" Andersen (shoulder), Matt Barnes (hamstring), Brandan Wright (knee), Jordan Adams (knee)Who did the Cavs have?

6378,nba,"I've argued on this sub that the Cavs should bring Kyrie off the bench but still give him starter-level minutes. My reasoning was that the Cavs are presently diluting the considerable talent of their three ball-dominant stars. Figuring out a way to stagger their minutes would enable the Cavs to maximize their stars' potential while always having one of the big three on the floor. Since Lebron and K-Love looked good together to start the season without Kyrie, I suggested it would make sense to experiment with bringing Kyrie off the bench, surrounding him with defensive specialists and spot up shooters, and giving him the green light to go nuts. At the time I argued that Delly could spend the first six minutes of every game tiring out the opposing point guard, after which the Cavs could bring Kyrie in to go ham on the opponents' bench. Since Kyrie is still young and since his past injuries are largely unrelated, I reasoned he would be able to handle the reduction in rest time that goes along with coming off the bench and playing big minutes. The reality of NBA egos and the status that goes with being a starter, however, makes this quite unlikely. Nevertheless, the Cavs have experimented with some success with a variation of my idea in which Kyrie starts but plays big minutes after the first quarter without Lebron and K-Love on the floor. This has allowed the Cavs to put an efficient offense on the floor while resting Lebron, which has been almost embarrassingly difficult for them to do this past year and a half. No team with this much talent should be so dependent on their best player, especially when that player is thirty-one years old and has played more basketball this past decade than maybe anyone else in the world. Even if this simple change paid off, however, the Cavs would not be even close to the Warriors' historic level of greatness. If they want to win the Finals rather than come up short for the second year in a row, the Cavs' coaching staff will have to countenance dramatic and risky changes in team strategy. It is an underappreciated fact about last years' Finals that David Blatt was out coached by Steve Kerr. People assume that Blatt's ability to push the series to six games by slowing the pace with a depleted lineup indicates good coaching, but this view misremembers the tit-for-tat coaching changes that characterized the first few games. At the suggestion of Luke Walton, Kerr benched Bogut in order to force the Cavs to limit Mozgov's minutes, as Mozgov was playing well but couldn't play perimeter defense against a small ball lineup. The purpose of this change was to further reduce the Cavs' already depleted rotation, and indeed the Cavs were generally able to play the Warriors well until the fourth quarter when fatigue set in. If a history of this era is ever written, I think this moment will be considered some sort of tipping point where small ball emerged as the new paradigm of NBA strategy. The Cavs, and in particular Lebron, have the talent to reverse last year's bad fortune. The Cavs should start a lineup of Lebron, Shump, Frye, Love, Mozgov. If the Warriors bench Bogut again, TT can replace Mozgov. If the Cavs are fully healthy during the Finals they have the personnel to create difficult matchups for the Warriors by starting Lebron at point guard. Lebron James is the only player of his size with the ball handling abilities and court vision to play point guard at an elite level. The Cavs need to find a way to take advantage of that fact when going up against a historically great team whose premier point guard happens to by small and wiry by NBA standards. The matchups on paper would look like this:Curry / LebronThompson / ShumpBarnes / FryeGreen / LoveBogut / MozgovIn actuality they would look something like this: Curry / ShumpThompson / LebronBarnes / LoveGreen / FryeBogut / MozgovThere are clear weaknesses for the Cavs, but this lineup puts Curry and therefore the Warriors in a difficult position. Shumpert is the Cavs' best bet for guarding Curry, and he would certainly be guarding Curry for large stretches even if Kyrie was on the floor. Curry will still get buckets, but this is a tough matchup on the other end for him as he gives up around three inches, thirty pounds, and some athleticism. When Shumpert is healthy he has the conditioning and physique to make life difficult for Curry when the Cavs have the ball, and so the Cavs should do their best to run Curry ragged. Replacing Shump with Smith early brings in a player who is four inches taller and 35 pounds heavier than Curry without giving up too much athleticism. And of course, the Cavs can bring Delly in against Curry for short stretches when Shump and Smith need a break from their difficult defensive task. I think that running Curry ragged when the Cavs have the ball and presenting size mismatches for most of the game is the best bet the Cavs have at beating the Warriors. Starting Lebron at pg and bringing Kyrie / Delly / Williams / Smith / RJ / TT off the bench is imo a risk the Cavs should take. In end of quarter situations James Jones can get the opportunity to splash a three, buying further rest for the Cavs.If they keep their current rotations and play at their current level, the series will be over in 4-5 games. If they are fully healthy, willing to start Lebron at point guard, and present constant size mismatches targeting Curry I think they have a shot.

6863,nba,"Hey r/nba, my name is Michael and some friends and I recently launched a sports and pop culture website to fill the void left in our lives by Grantland. In addition to being my first article for the site, this piece about Joe Johnson is also the first long-form article I have written about the NBA. I have included the text of the article and a link to our site at the bottom, per request of the mods. Make sure to check out all the other articles we have on the site and let me know what you think!This piece about Joe Johnson was written about a week and a half ago (and posted 3/17) so some of the numbers might be a bit dated. However, I think the overall points still stand. Enjoy!On February 27th, the Miami Heat beat out the Cleveland Cavaliers for the services of 7-time All Star Joe Johnson. Johnson, most recently of the Brooklyn Nets, was one of the highest paid players in the league at almost $25M. For some perspective, LeBron James is currently making a shade under $23M and Steph Curry, on probably one of the best contracts in NBA history, is making barely $11M. So it makes sense that the Nets would part with the aging star. The team is heading in a completely different direction after their “Big 3” experiment failed, and needs to unload money to pursue veteran free agents and make the team somewhat competitive as they await the return of the first round draft picks Billy King traded away like wampum.The bigger surprise was that Johnson chose to take his talents to South Beach rather than Cleveland in what we can only assume is to chase a ring. Cleveland currently tops the Eastern Conference and has the third best record in the NBA brought about by LeBron James, Kyrie Irving, Kevin Love, and a host of role players. Meanwhile, Miami currently sits in fourth in the conference with legitimate questions about the health of their second best player, Chris Bosh. Additionally, the cornerstone of the franchise, Dwyane Wade, is showing signs of age and injury while averaging 19 points, 4 rebounds, and 5 assists per game. All of this begs the question, why did Johnson pass-up on what many consider a sure fire finals appearance to play in Miami? While we can’t answer that for him, we can look at the impact he’s had on the team and what it could mean for a potential playoff run for the Heat.By The NumbersIn the 10 games since Johnson has joined the Heat it is evident that his presence has made a huge impact, most notably in Offensive Rating and 3P%. According to the numbers above, the team is scoring 7.5 more points per 100 possessions since Johnson has joined, and since he’s playing about 32 minutes per game, I think its safe to assume he has something to do with that. The team is defending at a slightly worse rate but not so much worse that it is reason to worry. Additionally, many of the players on the court with Johnson are good defenders, making it easier to hide him. For example, the lineup that Johnson has played in the most includes Luol Deng, Goran Dragic, Johnson, Amar’e Stoudemire, and Dwyane Wade. Three of those five players are plus defenders in a big way. When guarded by Dragic, Stoudemire, and Wade, players shoot 4.8%, 4.8%, and 2.4% worse than their averages, respectively. Putting Johnson on the weakest offensive perimeter player mitigates his risk and also saves his energy for offense.What is Johnson personally doing that has made his short time with the Heat so successful? One thing jumps out to me more than any other, three-point shooting.Since February 27th, the second most common offensive play run by Johnson is a “spot-up.” NBA.com defines a spot up as a play that ends with a catch and shoot or a catch and drive. See that blistering 58.6% 3-point shooting number up there? All 29 of Johnson’s three point attempts since he’s joined the Heat have come in spot-up situations. This means he’s being placed on the wing while a play is being run, the defense collapses on the paint, and Johnson is there for a wide-open shot. His current role with the Heat is actually very reminiscent of other players in recent years such as Ray Allen, James Jones, and Shane Battier. Johnson will undoubtedly regress to the mean in terms of his shooting percentage but its not unrealistic to assume he could shoot over 40% from three for the rest of the season, that would put him near top-20 in the league.Another valuable piece of Johnson’s game is his ability to generate his own shot. Over the years, this has earned him the nickname “Iso Joe”. It hasn’t always been a great thing in terms of team basketball, but having a reliable scorer to give the ball to with 8 seconds left on the shot clock is very important in the playoffs. Isolations account for slightly less than 11% of Johnson’s offensive possessions since joining the Heat, which is a good thing; ideally an offense should emphasize ball movement and motion instead of isolation. However, when you’re averaging 1.08 points per possession in those scenarios, the team can live with it from time to time.Too Little Too Late?Ultimately we won’t know Johnson’s true impact until the playoffs roll around in the coming weeks. Does he make the Heat a better team right now? Absolutely. His veteran leadership and offensive abilities are what made him coveted by a title-ready team like Cleveland. Personally I don’t think this moves the needle for Miami in terms of beating the Cavs and competing for a title, especially with Chris Bosh’s current health concerns. But, he does make the playoffs much more interesting. If Bosh is able to return at 100%, a second round Miami/Cleveland matchup could create a lot more fireworks than people in The Land would like.http://www.thelombardian.com/who-says-no/2016/3/17/0gyvehrypttzaf9610hyr78e3xcigv",21,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/4bse5x,[OC] Can Joe Johnson Spark the Heat?,That's exactly what my thinking was.

7126,nba,"We saw what he did last year. He put up crazy volume stats but was terribly inefficient at scoring if he doesn't have a top 3 player in the league to pass to.He averages over 10 assists, but he only gets the space to find passes because Durant gets so much attention on offense and spreads the floor. I think he's just a system player because he hasn't shown he can even lead a team to the playoffs. He needs a team to be built around him so he can do everything he does, like drive to the basket and dish out to shooters. His teammate is one of the best scorers in the league, shooting over 63% TS with 28 ppg, but Westbrook's usage rate is higher. Is there any player that can actually play with Westbrook who can be the 1st option? Honestly if Westbrook was on the same team as Michael Jordan in his prime, he would probably still be taking more shots than him. The dude thinks he's good enough to be a 1st option on a contender, but I don't think he is. He's just a system player who needs a team to be built around him to succeed, like Draymond Green.We saw in tonight's game that he shot 8-28 and played selfishly for most of the game. When he was out, the rest of the Thunder players made runs that got him back into the game. Then at the end of the game, he goes back to doing Westbrook things and loses the game for them in the last two minutes.

I want to get to it with the Heat. I want to be able to sign my deal and move on and not have to deal with any rumors, any free agency, any this, any that. This is where I want to end my career.

I mean you have 4 of the greatest players to ever play the game in that conference right now Durant, Dirk, Duncan, Chris Paul, and most likely Steph Curry. Then you have James Harden, Klay Thompson, Marc Gasol, Dwight Howard, and Russell Westbrook. Nobody wants to go to a Western Conference team (No offense but the teams are too strong) and if they go it's not for a Championship. Especially, if Durant joins up with GSW or SAS. Now I am not saying Durant is doing it for the money but more or less to make the best team in NBA history. Hopefully, he stays in OKC. If anything I for see Western Conference players coming to the Eastern Conference to take an easier path to the Finals.As a Heat fan I hope we don't trade our future away for 1-2 years of maybe beating a team in the Finals. When our future is looking so bright already. IMO a team of BRON, WADE, CP3, & MELO would have been great 3-5 years ago, but today can't compete with the likes of GSW + Durant or Spurs + Durant. Maybe even without a Durant because they have depth. Just food for thought. Oh, and Melo's comment on coming together later in their careers, yeh to lose? This is the end of Wade's career he only has a few years left. Melo you too. Every NBA player wants to win or make money. Not just lose and play with friends.

8336,nba,"Aldridge is having the most efficient season of his career, putting up 18 ppg on 57% TS. In his previous three seasons with Portland, he scored 22.5 ppg on 52% TS, which is below average and incredibly inefficient, especially for a guy his size. Before everyone says Aldridge has a better supporting cast this year, that might be true, but the Blazers had one of the best starting lineups in the league that complemented him perfectly (Lopez, Batum, Matthews, and Lillard), yet Aldridge was still very inefficient.This season, 32% of Aldridge's shot are catch and shoot. 45% of his shots are less than 10 feet away from the basket. Last season with the Blazers, 30% of his shots were catch and shoot and only 34% of his shots were less than 10 feet away.However, the major difference comes with the amount of fadeaway/turnaround  long 2's he has taken. This year, he has only take 96 fadeaway/turnaround jump shots. Last year, he took 209. The total number of 16-24 foot jumpers he took last year was 514. This year he's only at 283. (stats from [NBA Savant](nbasavant.com/))The Spurs have obviously realized that contested long 2's are an inefficient way to score and has made Aldridge take more shots in the paint, which makes sense since he's like 6'11 260+. He's playing more like an actual big man this season and taking much more efficient shots, even though he's already almost 31.If the Blazers realized this and put Aldridge into a better spot to succeed, he could've been a much better player. Instead, they wasted his prime years by allowing him to continue scoring very inefficiently, instead of utilizing his strengths.Does this show the incompetence of the Blazers coaching staff and not realize this? They built a perfect team around him when he was a Blazer, yet they never helped him adjust his game and play to his strengths. With guys like Lillard, Batum and Matthews to complement his skills in the post, the Blazers should've allowed Aldridge play to his strengths instead of allowing him to keep taking long contested jumpers.",28,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/4cg6tv,[OC] Did the Blazers ruin LaMarcus Aldridge's career by not playing him correctly?, doing that for the Spurs. ,http://reddit.com/r/nba/comments/4cg6tv/c/d1hu8xr,0,0

8472,nba,"Hi, everyone. A while ago I made a thread asking if r/nba would be interested in a thread that talks about top draft prospects once a week/month leading up to the draft. It got enough interest where I figured that I would start it up. The reason I think this would be good for r/nba is because some players can be great fits for the college game (Psycho T, Adam Morrison, Jimmer Fredette come to mind) being all time great college players, but appear to not have a game that translates well to the next level. I realize obviously you can never tell for certain if a player is going to boom or bust, but I think it would be cool to get more of a full perspective on each players draft profile.I will write in depth about a couple of players as well as a summary of a bunch of other prospects game, but feel free to comment a college player’s name and request a breakdown of their game. Diamond Stone (Maryland)-FreshmanWhat to like: 
To start, Stone possesses a great build for the NBA. He’s 6 foot 11 in shoes and weighs 255 pounds (for reference Kevin Love and Steven Adams weigh about 250). He has some ass long arms (7’ 3.5’’ wingspan, 9’ 1’’ standing reach) and does a good job with his post defense standing straight up and using his physical attributes to contest shots (1.7 blocks per game). Stone shoots very efficiently with a field goal percentage of 56.4%, and averages 12.8 points per game with most of his points coming off the pick and roll or from the block. He improved his free throw percentage from high school (which was in the high 50’s) to making 76.6% of his season and showing he may be a capable mid-range shooter at the NBA level. Stone runs the floor pretty well for a big, and already has great footwork in the post, already possessing a go-to move in his drop step. He gets a body on a player when going for rebounds (5.6 total rebounds in 22 minutes per game) and gets offensive rebounds (2.3 offensive boards in his 22 minutes). If Stone can have a little more hustle he could be a better defensive rebounder at the NBA level. Diamond has also shown the ability to be the “man” and go off, going off for 39 points against Penn State this year, clearly displaying great confidence in his abilities. Diamond has also shown the ability to be the “man” and go off, going off for 39 points against Penn State this year, clearly displaying great confidence in his abilitiesWhat not to like: He has lost his temper a couple of times and gets into some scuffles (was involved in a couple 2/27/16 against Purdue, giving a shove and later having some words with a Purdue player to result in a double technical). He even ended up getting suspended a game because he couldn’t stay composed. Obviously he’s young (19 years old), but he’s going to need to work on his composure at the next level. He also needs to work a little bit on using his size more to create more space for easier shots down low, because lankier centers seem to be able to block him easily due to his poor vertical. His motor also seems to be questionable at times. He boxes out okay most of the time, but he will not chase down defensive boards. He will get caught not fighting around good post seals or screens as much as you’d like. Diamond Stone had a couple of opportunities to chase down a defensive rebound or try to get around a post player to contest a shot in Maryland’s loss to Purdue down the stretch, but he failed to do so. Motor has been a major problem for him since high school, and hopefully he can improve it.Jaylen Brown (California)-FreshmanWhat’s to like:
Jaylen Brown has great physical tools for a small forward, standing 6 foot 7 with a wingspan that is pterodactyl-like being just over 7 feet. And his length doesn’t come at the cost of his strength and weight, with Brown weighing a little over 220 pounds and knowing how to use every pound to create some space. He is extremely explosive, especially with his first step, and in a transition he can either take it and go by himself or correctly fill the lanes to get an easy bucket. He can put up some highlight reel finishes with contact and can get to the line often (6.5 Free Throw Attempts a game). Because of his ability to get to the rim and finish there is a lot of potential for him to be a great scorer in the NBA (Brown averages 15.5 points per game in a little over 27 minutes of play). This video of his scoring highlights vs. Richmond earlier this season clearly display his scoring potential for the NBA level What not to like:
Jaylen Brown’s shooting ability is pretty shaky at the college level. He shoots only 31.9% from the shorter college 3, and despite his great ability to get to the free throw line; he only makes 64.4% of his attempts there. He also can have trouble taking care of the ball and making good decisions, averaging 3 turnovers a game in a little over 27 minutes of play. Brown has a tendency to force the issue and commit stupid turnovers, as well as drive into traffic, causing him to force up some bad shots.  He also has a problem over dribbling and losing the ball because of it. Buddy Hield (Oklahoma)-Senior: Buddy Hield (a 6 foot 4, 214 pound guard) is the biggest offensive threat in this draft class, averaging 25.3 points a game on 49.3 FG%, 89 FT%, and 47.6 3PT%. But the most astonishing part of his game is that his 47.6 3PT% is on almost 9 three point attempts per game. His release on his 3-point shot is quicker than the norm with already NBA range, and he is nearly automatic if a defender doesn’t get a hand up. Biggest knocks on him are he’s already 22 years old and his defense and athleticism aren’t great, but his floor at the NBA level should be a spot up shooter, making him one of the safer picks in the draft.Kris Dunn (Providence)-Junior Dunn’s the best point guard in this draft class, standing 6 foot 4 and weighing 205 pounds (not to mention having a 6 foot 9 wingspan). He is a do it all type of guard, averaging 16.4 points a game, 5.8 boards, 6.3 assists, and 2.8 steals in 33 minutes a game.  He has great handles for the NBA level, nice playmaking ability, and does a good job attacking the basket having some nice acrobatic finishes. But despite his ability to get to the basket, he can make poor decisions, averaging 3.5 turnovers a game and shooting around 44% from the field. He also needs to work on his outside jump shot a little more because he is only shooting 35% from the college 3 and 69.6% from the free throw line. He’s projected to be a top 5 pick as of right now.Ben Simmons (LSU)-Freshman Simmons is as of right now the top prospect in this draft class. He’s a 6 foot 10, 240 pound forward, that in 35 minutes a game is putting up 19.7 points, 12.1 rebounds (3.1 offensive), 5.1 assists, 1.9 steals, and 0.9 blocks on a 56.6% Field Goal percentage. He isn’t a perfect prospect however despite what his stat line says averaging 3 turnovers a game and showing little ability to hit jumpers and shoot the ball (He’s only taken three 3 pointers this year, hitting one. He also shoots only 68.5% from the free throw line despite getting an elite 9.1 free throw attempts a game). It is also worth noting that his team will most likely not make the NCAA tournament which is extremely odd for someone projected to go #1 overall (Slightly empty stats maybe?). He is most likely going to be a point forward at the next level, and while he probably won’t live up to the LeBron comparisons (how many can?), he could be a great player at the next level.Brandon Ingram (Duke)-Freshman Ingram is a very talented scorer and as of right now considered the 2nd best prospect in the draft besides Ben Simmons. He has a build similar to Kevin Durant coming out of college, standing 6 foot 9 but weighing only 196 pounds. He has shown the ability to take over games scoring the basketball which were key in big wins for Duke against Louisville (18 points 10 boards when Louisville was ranked the 13th best team in the nation), Virginia (25 points 7 boards when Virginia was the 7th best team in the nation), and North Carolina (20 points 10 boards with UNC ranked 5th in the nation). Ingram’s college averages in 34 minutes of playtime per game are 16.9 points, 6.8 boards, 1.9 assists, 1.1 steals, and 1.4 blocks per game. He shoots the ball from deep extremely well (40.6% from 3 point land on over 5 attempts a game). His main weakness right now is strength and he could work on his finishing (45% field goal percentage). He’s a year younger than Simmons, with Ingram being born September 2nd 1997, so his age and his superior shooting could lead some teams to look at Brandon Ingram as a potential #1 overall pick.",25,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/494dv6,R/NBA 2016 In Depth Prospect Thread #1,"I won't sleep on him, and he's another guy to watch for a little later in the draft. I like his game and watching him play. I love how he gives the ball up to the right players in transition (very good at making reads on where the ball should go), and he has a very high basketball IQ and hustle. He does a little bit of everything (19.3 PPG, 7.6 REB, 7.3 AST, 44 3PT% on nearly 8 attempts) and seems like a great team player. He could be a steal in the middle of the first/late lottery.

Say all you want about how he had a lot of talent, but with superstar talent comes superstar egos, and he was the perfect person to handle those. Pop is much more about treating everyone equally and expecting the same hard work from stars and role players. He was lucky to have the perfect blend of superstar level talent with unselfish hardworking attitude and coachability in Duncan since day 1. His head would explode if he had to deal with MJ/Kobe/Shaq like egos. Makes sense that someone like Horry would prefer Pop, because even though Phil's triangle does emphasize role players, the locker room and atmosphere of a Popovich coached team would be much more ideal for role players",http://reddit.com/r/nba/comments/4azjkd/c/d14u820,27,7
8485,nba,"Under the current rules, if the game is tied at the end of the period, the players continue to play overtime periods until the game is decided. My idea: if the game is still tied after the first overtime, then each team will select five players who will then play one-on-one with the other team's players (similar in concept to the sudden death shoot-outs in other games). Rules: Use a coin-toss (or whoever won the first tip-off) to decide who gets posession of the ball first (call the winner team A, and the other team B). Team A sends out one of its five players to play offense, and in response, team B can select its defender based on who team A chooses. However, each player can only be selected to play offense or defense once during the shoot-out (unless both teams are tied after all five players play, I'll get to that later). The two players then go one-on-one against each other. Assume both teams are in the bonus, and each two counts for two, and three counts for three (I was considering a 1-2 scoring system, but think that would give three-point shooters too much of an edge). After the first game, alternate the order so that team B selects a player for offense, and team A selects their player for defense. After the five games are played (and each player has played once on offense and defense), if the game is still tied, then proceed to sudden death. Without knowing who the other team selects, each team selects one player who will play offense and defense in a series of one-on-ones until the game is decided. Example: if player A gets first posession and scores two points, player B must score two points as well to tie (alternatively, he can go for a 3 to win the game), otherwise team B loses. However, if player A misses, and player B scores anything then team B wins. After each tie, alternate which player goes first on offense, and then continue until a winner is decided.This idea came about after talking with a friend. Now, I know it will never happen, but I think it would be tons of fun if they ever implemented it. Most of the fans would love to see the star basketball players go one-on-one against each other, but there's no incentive for the stars to risk their reputation like that. With this system, the players will need to give it their all since the game is on the line, and it would be extremely exciting given its rarity (not sure how often double overtimes occur,  but its definitely infrequent).

8656,nba,"Derrick Rose, one of the most top to bottom careers in NBA history, is someone who I believe will get in the Hall of Fame (though he might not deserve it)
To prove this, I'll bring up two cases.
Number 1: Bill Walton.
Bill Walton, a great player (When he wasn't hurt)
Bill Walton only scored 6,215 Points (Though he did win two NBA championships and 1 MVP) While Derrick Rose has scored 7,925 Points Already (and he is under 30). Derrick Rose, forgoing another horrible injury, has a chance to win at least 1 championship, and might eventually reach around 13,000 to 15,000 career points. This, going along with his MVP, makes him an eventual player of the HoF.
A much stronger reason to put him in the HoF Ralph Sampson, a player who never won an NBA Championship or MVP, and was only a four time all star, and yet he is in the Hall Of Fame.

8675,nba,"Recently I have been researching the kind of effect that the NBA has on communities based around teams and I was astounded to to see the results. Since it was created in 2005, NBA Cares has raised over $200 million dollars and put in over 2.5 million hours of community service. The NFL has Play 60, but they do not have nearly as many hours put into community service as the NBA and their way of giving back is centered around playing sports, whereas NBA cares helps build homes, volunteers at soup kitchens, as well as sets up sports related clinics.
The reason for my research was because of the new Turner Broadcasting contract coming into play this year. When the contract starts, they will be making over 3 billion dollars a year from Turner alone. That money will be divvied up  throughout the league and, as many await, the salary cap will skyrocket, but what this could really mean is more money put into the surrounding communities. They have been giving 24 million annually back to communities but now they can potentially tie 78 million a year back if not more. The NBA would not only be one of the most community-involved leagues but it would be one of the most community-involved companies in the country. What do you think? 
As a basketball fan do you like to see them take action to give back?
Would you like to see them invest more money into the communities?
Do you think the TV deal will change the way the NBA does business?",28,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/4ag6q9,Discussion: Does the NBA have the most control on American communities out of the four major sports?,"Eventually, they'll use their army of super athletes to destroy all other sports leagues and reign supreme throughout the continent.

8678,nba,"The Raptors possess one of the most unique constructs of an effective NBA offense in terms of modern play styles. Most teams trend towards “pace and space” and play with one big man and one primary ball-handler who are surrounded by three wing players, all of whom can shoot. This ideal offense would be fast paced and it would produce something efficient. The Raptors possess so little of those attributes and are still an incredibly effective offense, one which has ranked in the top 5 in offensive efficiency over the past 2 years, and top 10 over the past 3. During this time, they have always ranked in the bottom half of the league in terms of pace and have even managed to improve on the number of possessions a game each year, but continue to slide down the league rankings all the way to second last this season.  While the Raptors don’t have a high frequency of possessions which would be classified as “fast breaks” or “transition”, the possessions which are up-tempo in nature are effective and deliberate. The Raptors rank in the bottom 10 for frequency of transition plays, accounting for 11.5% of their possessions, yet they are the most efficient team in the league in transition, scoring 1.21 PPP1. Here are a variety of ways in which they both simply and effectively beat teams in transition, regardless of how sparingly it occurs.Drag Screen  A drag screen is essentially a pick and roll in (semi) transition. The goal is to get all of the effects of a regular pick and roll (allow the ball handler to gain an advantage, whether it be penetration or an open shot) but without any of the hassle of the defense being set. The Raptors’ primary ball-handlers, DeMar DeRozan and Kyle Lowry, both excel at getting to the rim in a half-court setting, but allowing these two to get easier paths to the rim is crucial, especially considering some of the tight spacing due to personnel.  Drag Screen: Ball-Handler CompilationSimple miscommunications become more numerous when drag screens are used when compared to their traditional, half court counterpart.
Here, you can see the Bulls have the advantage in terms of players that are actually in the active half of the court.
Yet, when Valanciunas sets a drag screen for Lowry, Gibson acts as the big man defender that “showed” on the pick and roll, even though that is Gasol’s role. Gibson does a poor job of impeding Lowry’s progress while Rose recovers, and allows Lowry to continue his drive to the rim. Because Gasol wasn’t active defensively from the start, he doesn’t jump in at any point.  In that same photo, we can see where Gasol’s focus was (red arrow, following roll man) versus where he should’ve rotated to (white arrow, stopping Lowry drive to rim). If he were to have done so, Moore would’ve rotated from the weak side behind him and Lowry would have had to make a difficult baseline pass to DeRozan for three, a much more palatable shot for the Bulls than an uncontested layup.  The upside of this play is that it is bound to produce a ton of penetration, which naturally leads to help defenders collapsing in on the ball-handler. As a result, Raptors’ ball-handlers have become accustomed to dishing the rock to the roll man as well as properly spaced shooters.Drag Screen: Passing CompilationDouble DragSimilar in nature to the regular Drag Screen, a Double Drag Screen is very effective in its own right. As you might have guessed, it is the same principal as a drag screen, except there are two screeners instead of the traditional one.Double Drag Screen: Ball-Handler Scoring & Passing CompilationThe advantage gained here can be assigned to a few factors. Firstly, when using an action that preys on the lack of preparation a defense, it is beneficial to have variance, even if it is nominal. Secondly, it pulls a second big man away from the paint/rim. If the big man doesn’t come out and defend, Patrick Patterson is bound to bomb away from deep. When the secondary big man does come away from the paint, it opens up driving lanes for the ball-handler, as well as the rolling screener, both of which have opportunities to finish at the rim.Additionally, another benefit to using sets such as these is that it allows for easy transition into other actions, such as Wide Pindowns.Wide PindownsHere, Biyombo and Patterson set a Double Drag screen for Lowry and unfortunately, no advantage is gained. Biyombo quickly acknowledges this and goes into the next action by screening for DeRozan. On the catch, DeRozan uses Biyombo as a shield and punishes the defender for not trailing him on his hip and drains the jumper. More traditionally, in transition a Wide Pindown is usually set for one of the Raptors’ wing players, such as DeRozan or Ross, as the primary action. In doing so, the big men act as screeners early on in the offense to try and catch a defender sleeping. The Raptors aim for the defender to stay on DeRozan’s hip as he drives to the hoop, though he is no stranger to taking a tough shot if an easier one isn’t immediately presented.Wide Pindown: Ball-Handler CompilationThe Raptors also like to have their wings flow through and exchange sides of the court if a Pindown doesn’t work in their favour initially. Afterwards, DeRozan will typically have a Flare screen set and work off of any separation he can get.Similarly to the Drag Screen, a Wide Pindown early on in the clock can gain penetration, leading to an inevitable breakdown of the defense and an open look for the big man who was originally a screener.Wide Pindown: Passing CompilationOutro  It is clear that the Raptors have found use in their methodical, early offensive sets. They are a slower team in nature, which works in their favour. They love to get to the line and exhaust every opportunity to find the perfect driving lane to get there. While that is their M.O. as an offense, they also make great use of finding easy buckets that provide them with similar shot distribution. It isn’t as bountiful in volume Golden State's transition offense, but it doesn’t need to be. An efficient easy look here-and-there is enough to grease the wheels and keep their methodical offense chugging along. The Raptors have found a nice balance in understanding their strength, which lies in their two best perimeter players, which can sometimes take time as they find their best look, while also attacking (relatively) early when the opportunity presents itself.

With the inevitable WCF matchup between these two (OKC and LAC will definitely have something to say about that, but there are question marks with the Thunder's consistency and how Griffin's return will help or possibly hurt the Clips) on many peoples' minds, the Warriors are rightfully considered the favorite in this matchup. However, we all know Pop's tendency to withhold his team's best plans until actually matching up in the playoffs, and this is likely the most all-around talented Spurs team we've seen in a long time while still maintaining much of their depth theyve relied on for the past few years. I still think the Warriors win in a close 7 games, but you never count out the Spurs.So the question is, if the Spurs pull off a victory against the Dubs, will it really be considered an upset? One one hand, it will definitely look odd that this team which has been constantly compared and held to the standards of the 96 Bulls ended up not even making the Finals (obviously context matters. the WCF is likely the true finals this year, but still). On the other hand, it isnt like they lost to some scrubs. Spurs on pace for 70 wins, all time great defense, GOAT coach, elite offensive system, have arguably the best perimeter defender in the game (whose offense has made him a consensus top 10 player) and arguably the best rim protector. They have the marquee free agent from the last offseason who has bought into the system while still knowing when to be aggressive.

8927,nba,"In the 1940s the All-NBA teams were positionless.  Do you think it would be better to return all-NBA selections to what they originally were?I think the All-NBA teams should capture the best 15 individual seasons in basketball in that year.  Unlike All-Star selections, where sentimentality and the desire to see older stars in the All-Star game play a role in the decisions, there should be no concern about the style of a player's game, his legacy, watchability, etc.Since the league is currently dominated by point guard play and elite outside shooting, I think the three All-NBA teams should be extremely point guard heavy.  Here's my top 15:Curry, Lowry, Westbrook, Leonard, DurantLillard, Isaiah Thomas, Klay Thompson, Lebron, KATChris Paul, Kemba Walker, John Wall, Paul George, Draymond GreenThere are 8 point guards there, but I think that's reflective of the league right now, and the way the game is officiated - if you have one of those eight guys, it's more valuable than having DeMarcus Cousins, Brook Lopez, or Dwight Howard.There are six frontcourt players in the list above (two per team).  If the voting for All-NBA was 2 front court spots, 2 back court spots, and one 'util'/G-F-C slot, it would make the All-NBA teams do a better job of capturing leaguewide trends, player value, and who the best 15 players in the league truly were each season.Last year, for example, Kawhi Leonard had more total votes than Klay Thompson and Kyrie, but they earned third-team selections over him because of how loaded the forward position was last year.  I would like for the voting to avoid those types of scenarios.  A purist would look at those three lineups above and say, 'That doesn't look like a basketball team - so and so would get murdered in the post.'  But all three of those lineups would be even more impossible to guard at the other end.  I don't think you could build a five-man lineup using the remaining players in the league that could beat any of those three All-NBA teams in a pick up game right now.

9141,nba,"I'm not here to say that John Stockton was the greatest point guard of all time. His game was not nearly as well rounded as some like Chris Paul or Magic. He was not exactly a prolific scorer and the fact that he never won a ring always enters into these discussions. That being said, his numbers seem to jump off of the page at you. He was a 10 time all star, 5 time all defense second team, member of the dream team, averaged a career double-double, retired with FG% above .50, and holds the record for assist total by FAR as well as the steals record by significant margin. Looking at the list of assisters in league history, Jason Kidd sits at two but with almost 4000 total assists less than Stockton. He also sits roughly 600 steals ahead of Kidd on the steals list as well. I have been trying to wrap my mind around the amount of assisting this man did so I tried to parallel him to a somewhat similar, current player.  I went with Chris Paul, who is a great guard who can score but excels at assisting and making those around him better and has also never won a ring. Paul will inevitably go down as one of the best guards and assisters of our generation. He currently sits comfortably at 11th all time in assists. This is impressive seeing as he has only been in the league since '05. That being said there is little chance that he will ever get the roughly 8,000 more assists in his career needed to pass Stockton. I tend to think trying to rank players is pointless because in the end there really isn't a right answer but i like hearing peoples' reasoning for who outranks who. Most people fall back to ring counting which works in many cases but leaves out great players like Barkley, Nash, Malone, Miller, Ewing, and Baylor. Arguably the most objective way to make rankings is to go by real numbers and when you look at lists of the top players in the 5 major categories: points, assists, rebounds, blocks, and steals. The players at the top or near the top of those lists are almost always near the top of many peoples' lists of greatest players of all time and Stockton is the only player currently topping two of those five categories. I guess the question is where is the right place to rank the man with the most cookies and dimes of all time? I rarely hear his name in discussion of best PG of all time, so where do you place him among the best point guards or guards in general?",20,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/4bno28,Where is the right place to rank Stockton among the PG greats?,EDIT 2: Did some math on that and 14.5 asts per game is like 32 points created.

Really, it would have taken a perfect storm to follow that up- and we got an imperfect storm.Also, I felt like that was honestly a lesser of two evils because trust me, damn near everybody was gonna revolt over another Spurs/Pistons series.More than anything, this series makes me wonder how the Pistons blew that series and why their series collapse isn't remembered more. I think it's the most underrated chokejob in NBA history. Given the rosters and head coaches, Detroit quite frankly got off the hook for that gagjob given all we heard about how awful those Finals were (And that's coming from someone who wanted the Cavs to win because I did NOT want Pistons-Spurs II- which by no means would have been a better series.) It is one of the biggest chokes in NBA playoff history. And yet had they won, the Finals wouldn't have been THAT much better.2010- The NBA Playoffs started with a lot of unique promise and potential. But as the playoffs went on, a lot of the interesting teams fell by the wayside. No Lebron/Kobe, no Melo/LeBron, no Lakers/Magic rematch, no 2010 Suns (a team that I found captivating). OKC and Portland got the wrong draws. No Orlando Finals redemption, no possible Finals for Nash/HillI HATED that Lakers/Celtics Finals so much, even moreso than the much maligned 2005 Spurs/Pistons Finals. I took absolutely no joy in that series. They had won before, so it didn't have any of that new car smell if you will. By that time, the Lakers/Kobe were basically the biggest thing in sports and I was essentially Lakered out.It was the least enjoyable seven-game series ever, so much so that I rooted for the Celtics to win game six just so I didn't have to see another game.Then, I just watched game seven so it could end. Basically the same final score as SAS/DET game 7, only it didn't even have a memorable game ala Horry in game 5.Thank goodness things picked up after that.

9465,nba,"Edit 4-11: I half assed this list a while back thought about it some more spent more time on it and basically revamped the whole thing. First so we get it out of the way. Here are the key free agents for upcoming years 2016: Note Im assuming LBJ either doesnt opt out or is just automatically resigning or doing his 1+1 bullshit
Durant, Al Horford, Mike Conley, DeMar DeRozan(im assuming he opts out), Hassan Whiteside, Nic BatumRFAs(most of the time this didnt have much impact): Andre Drummond, Harrison Barnes, Bradley Beal, Jordan Clarkson, Harrison Barnes 2017: 
Stephen Curry, Russell Westbrook, Blake Griffin(Im assuming he opts out), Chris Paul(same), Serge Ibaka, Kyle Lowry(same as other two), Paul Millsap(same), Gordon Hayward(same), Danilo Gallinari(same), JJ Redick, Jrue Holiday, Greg Monroe(same) RFA: Giannis Antetokounmpo, Rudy Gobert, Victor Oladipo, Nikola Mirotic, Nerlens Noel, Steven Adams 2018: 
UFA: Avery Bradley, Isaiah Thomas, DeMarcus Cousins, James Harden, Derrick Favors(not an exhaustive list)Here's the list. 1) Karl Anthony Towns: Idk, I could write a whole big thing about it, but this just feels right 2) Stephen Curry: He's 28. He's also gonna be making $25 mil more per yr than KAT starting next summer.  Odds are pretty low he'll ever have a season like this again. Best bet is we see a mix of 2013, 2014 and then also 2015 Curry the next few years before he starts declining. Add it all up, KAT is the guy IMHO. Still, this could easily end up being wrong not putting him at the top. 3) Anthony Davis: He misses at least 15 games a year, he really declined on D this year and I dont think long term he can play Center. Still, Id rather have him for the long haul than Kawhi. 4) Kawhi Leonard: He's not gonna keep up the 45% shooting from 3 and I just dont think it's sustainable past a point to keep up this perennial DPOY year stuff. Even if he goes from this to top 3-5 defensive player in the league in coming years, it affects his value. Counter to that is he keeps adding more and more to his offense. 5) LeBron James 6) Kevin Durant: No idea what the hell to do with him. I looked at it like this: If I were OKC and there were no trade deadline and somebody called me with an offer for Durant the five guys above are still the only ones Id consider moving him for even with the upcoming free agency. 7) Paul George 8) Russell Westbrook: He's a UFA next year but by and large same logic with KD. I still wouldnt trade him for anybody below this list.9) Giannis Antetokounmpo 10) DeMarcus Cousins 11) Jimmy Butler: Contract pushed above of Harden. 12) James Harden: All the stuff, the D and the complete lack of effort, him not getting along with people and him just not being a guy to provide leadership and be the one who people respond to well, it all adds up as to reasons behind what happened in Houston this year. 13) John Wall: 14) Damian Lillard: 15) Draymond Green: For as much as you could argue ""Would he be as good on a different team"" etc alot of this comes down to his contract as to why he got bumped up16) Kristaps Porzingis: This is probably 5 spots too high and really highlights how all the upcoming free agency affects things.  17) Andre Drummond: 18) Rudy Gobert19) Andrew Wiggins: He's not really doing things to help teams win( not efficient, defense isnt what you were hoping itd be) but still hard not to see him at least bordering on all-star caliber down the road. 20) Blake Griffin: You could talk me into this being too low or ten spots too high. Total wildcard. Just cant get out of my head what he did to the Spurs last year. 21) Derrick Favors 22) CJ McCollum: Next 5 spots or so were by far the hardest out of any. 23) LaMarcus Aldridge: I think he'll age well24) Jae Crowder: That contract thou...Im not as big a Crowder guy as some(I think there' a decent chance he regresses some next year) but this was the guy who benefited more from his contract than anybody else 25) Kevin Love: The real Love is somewhere between that Minnesota guy who put up absurd stats that even smart people were calling him a borderline top 5 player and this albatross who's in the worst situation imaginable. 26) Chris Paul: There's a pretty strong historical precedent that people this size fall off around this age. Combine that with him being a UFA next summer and this is what you get. 27) Aaron Gordon: Im all in 28) Eric Bledsoe 29) DeAndre Jordan: Last two years of the contract probably arent going to be great value but DAJ has finally been as good people said he was in the past this year on defense.30) Nikola Jokic 31) Kyrie Irving: Voulgaris summed it up perfectly ""He's the new Rudy Gay"". It's less and less clear he actually significantly helps teams in terms of winning basketball. Hasnt looked the same at all this yr post injury32) Khris Middleton33) Klay Thompson: He in particular on GS is the guy who wouldnt look anywhere close to as good on a number of other teams. 34) Gordon Hayward: Huge fan but this is what being a FA next summer will do and cause you to slide. 35) Jabari Parker: He's really started coming on past few months, this might be too low 36) Kyle Lowry: He's a legit All NBA guy this year but that's not what this list is about. He'll never have a year as good as this again, he's 30, he's not the type wholl age well and he's gonna be a FA next summer. 37) Myles Turner 38) D'Angelo Russell: Lol 39) Carmelo Anthony: The declines gonna keep coming i dont think people realize how different he is now than he was 2 years ago even. 40) Justice Winslow: The comparisons he gets are a little ridiculous but he's pretty much a lock to be a top notch defender. That and if he can project to being an average-slightly below average offensive player is plenty to keep him here. 41) Jonas Valanciunas: Shout out for finally improving the D. 42) Emmanuel Mudiay: Huge fan coming out, he's done enough lately to restore faith after having one of thee worst offensive seasons in NBA history first few months 43) Isaiah Thomas 44) Tobias Harris: If he keeps playing like he has since being with SVG he's gonna keep rising. 45) Devin Booker: I hate how bad he looks defensively but cant drop him any lower. 46) Ricky Rubio: He should make All-Defense this year. 47) Avery Bradley: 48) Victor Oladipo49) Jahlil Okafor: I guess he's gotta be on here but there's nothing enticing about a traditional big who's looking this bad on defense.50) Clint Capela: Im probably a little too high on him but fuck it Just Missed Category in Order: Paul Millsap Trey Lyles Nikola Vucevic Brook Lopez Danilo Gallinari Serge Ibaka Reggie Jackson Bradley Beal Cody Zeller ",22,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/4bsrya,Trade Value Rankings for 2016,"Serge Ibaka does not have more trade value than Klay, Lowry, DeAndre, Middleton, Jabari, Crowder, Carmelo, Beal, Noel, DeRozan, or even Nikola fucking Jokic",http://reddit.com/r/nba/comments/4bsrya/c/d1c2g6s,0,7

[EDIT: Tried to fix formatting. And for those who live in terrible places - take a joke!]When NBA players reach the rare points of their careers when they actually have the unfettered discretion to choose where they want to live and play basketball, they choose different places for different reasons. Where would he have the best opportunity to contend for a championship? Who can pay him the most money? Where can he be the number one option and play the way he wants to play? Who has the best coach and front office? Which city has the best weather? Which city has the best clubs? The best strip clubs? Proximity to models? Proximity to Kardashians? Where did he grow up?Recently, every slight compliment that Kevin Durant bestows on a team or a town leads to wild speculation of where he will play next season. As the biggest free agent since Lebron took his talents to South Beach in 2010 and since he took his somewhat fading talents back to Lake Erie in 2014, there is good reason to speculate about KD’s future. In all likelihood, his carefully crafted decision will lead to five years of playing for the Larry O’Brien trophy no matter which jersey he dons.The complexities of the Collective Bargaining Agreement, the increasing intelligence of most front offices in the league (sorry Sacramento), and the ability to be marketable from anywhere in a globalized economy have changed the way that players make decisions. It is no longer about forcing yourself to the biggest market, which historically, have been the places where a player was most likely to win. A monstrous television deal that will only increase in the next couple of years has leveled the playing field. As has a CBA where a team actually has to plan and make smart decisions to manage their salary cap situation.But let’s pretend that it’s just about the city and the history of the franchise (but not the active basketball operations, coach and players. So – for example – we can say Michael Jordan played there! But, we cannot factor in Fred Hoiberg, the general current management of the team or the fact that you can play with Jimmy Butler). All else being equal – which NBA locations/teams are the most attractive to NBA players? Remember, we are looking at this from the perspective of young millionaires.BIG CITY, BRIGHT LIGHTS:Los Angeles LakersIt used to be like the rap wars of the mid-1990s. East Coast or West Coast? Biggie or Pac? New York or L.A.? Los Angeles had Hollywood opportunities (What if I told you that you get play a 7 foot genie, star alongside Francis Capra and Da Brat and be directed by the genius behind The Cutting Edge and three episodes of Miami Vice?) Jack Nicholson watching courtside, young actresses (and aspiring ones) flooding the Forum Club and then Hyde at the Staples Center. You could have a mansion in Beverly Hills or on the Strand in Manhattan Beach. A player could enjoy the finest well-done steaks at Mastro’s.Or you could live in a Park Avenue penthouse. Give high-fives to Jay-Z. Get your boy a guest spot on Law & Order SVU. 4:00 a.m. nights with models in Tribeca and SOHO. And most importantly, being in the center of the media universe could make you as marketable as…Patrick Ewing?But times have changed. In the age of Twitter and Vine, League Pass, and nationally televised games, no matter where you are, players don’t needNew York. They don’t need L.A. But they still want L.A. The perfect weather and the pull of Hollywood, which remains the epicenter of the entertainment industry. A place where you can blend in and be afforded a little more privacy because residents are more excited by encounters with Jax fromVanderpump Rules.Los Angeles remains the place where you can play for one of the two most storied teams in the league, while being able to roll along Pacific Coast Highway in a convertible maroon Bentley on a 78 degree January afternoon.It is the Lakers history that puts L.A. at the top. Veterans grew up watching the late Magic years. Younger players grew up watching the Kobe-Shaq dynasty or the Kobe-Pau years. The games under the Showtime lighting, framed yellow jerseys and 16 championship banners just feel different. It is one thing to be an NBA player. It is a whole other to be a Laker.Miami HeatIt’s pretty much Los Angeles, but with the occasional hurricane, worse humidity, and Cuban telenovelas instead of big-budget motion pictures. Miami still has the beach and the clear and beautiful warm waters of South Florida. NBA players love neon lights and other bright shit, making South Beach a favorite. There are the palm trees and the waterfront mansions. A player can still date models. Prime 112 has tempura lobster (A Jalen Rose favorite).Alonzo Mourning and the late 1990s teams brought legitimacy to a new organization. Dwyane Wade and Pat Riley turned them into a premiere franchise and Lebron and the big-three era catapulted the Heat to arguably becoming the most marquee NBA franchise, other than the Lakers and Spurs, in the post-Jordan era.Also, in case you forgot every Cribs episode, never underestimate an NBA player’s adoration for Scarface.BIG CITY, NOT AS BRIGHT LIGHTS:Los Angeles ClippersBasically the Lakers, but with selfies hanging inside Staples instead of championship banners and nostalgia for Eric Piatkowski instead of Magic Johnson.The trash organization gained legitimacy when the NBA evicted their slumlord owner and brought in a tech billionaire whose products are not used by a single person in Los Angeles, most of whom are working on Broad City spec scripts at their local coffee shop.The marketability factor is still present with opportunities for players to be the king of insurance or mid-tier Korean family sedans.It’s still Los Angeles and a player can always go out on Sunset and pretend he is on the Lakers.New York KnicksWe pretend the Knicks are the unheralded kings of free agency. That everyone dreams of playing at the Garden and living in New York. But unless you grew up in the five boroughs - no one liked Ewing, Starks, Oak and Anthony Mason (RIP). Most NBA players would not know if Bernard King played on the Knicks between 1983-1987 or 1963-1967. The oldest active player in the NBA (the professor, Andre Miller) was born approximately three years AFTER the Knicks last won an NBA championship. Sorry, the Knicks aren’t a premiere NBA organization. And this is without even mentioning James Dolan.And - contrary to popular opinion - New York City is not the premiere place to live if you are an NBA superstar. A player would rather live in a sprawling 8,000 square foot mansion with a regulation sized basketball court, shark tank, nine-hole golf course, and a Ritz Carlton quality pool than pay $10 million for a 2,000 square foot apartment or brownstone.Your average NBA player would rather eat at The Cheesecake Factory than the awesome hole-in-the-wall Pho spot or David Chang’s latest Michelin rated restaurant.NBA players aren’t known to spend Saturday afternoons strolling the Museum of Modern Art or checking out trendy and provocative performance art projects in Bushwick warehouses.It isn’t 1981, so nearly every NBA city has some semblance of nightlife where a player can enjoy a bottle of Dom P, VIP area, and have a flock of jersey-chasers clamoring for attention.NBA players don’t fuck with the Subway.New York is really cold during approximately 80% of the NBA regular season.But even though I spent approximately 300 words shitting on New York, it’s still New York. Just ask JR Smith.[NOTE – THIS ABOVE PARAGRAPH DOES NOT APPLY TO YOU IF YOU ARE MARRIED TO LA LA].Brooklyn NetsThe team’s history is buried in a swamp in New Jersey. The legacy of the team since it has moved to Brooklyn centers around former stars who were collective decades removed from their primes.NBA players are not Lena Dunham.It’s still New York, but not quite.Basically the New York Clippers.Having a Russian Oligarch multi-billionaire for an owner is pretty cool.NOT L.A. OR MIAMI, BUT THE WEATHER IS NICEHouston RocketsIt’s hot. There is good food and lots of chain restaurants. Huge houses for cheap and no state taxes. Paul Wall, Mike Jones (who?) and Chamillionaire were at the height of their popularity when most of these guys were in junior high and high school.Hakeem might help you with your footwork.Allegedly, great strip clubs.Dallas MavericksIt’s hot. There are quality steakhouses and lots of chain restaurants. Huge houses for cheap and no state taxes. Unfortunately, no strong rap history.No one to help you with your footwork, but Cuban provides the best perks (remember when he put a Playstation 2 in every player’s locker back in 2002?)A lot of players are Dallas Cowboys fans because they are front-running assholes who grew up with the Irvin, Emmett and Aikman teams.Allegedly, great strip clubs.And if Chandler Parsons chose to play there you know it is a good time.Phoenix SunsIt’s really hot. There are lots of chain restaurants. Huge houses for cheap, but there are state taxes. Unfortunately, no strong rap history.NBA players treat Phoenix as if it is a distant suburb of Los Angeles.Few models, but plenty of surgically enhanced cleavage and Arizona State Coeds.More NBA players than you think golf.Pool parties where players can wear socks, rubber Nike sandals, and two pairs of oversized basketball shorts.The Steve Nash teams revolutionized basketball and rescued the NBA from the 84-79 point games era. Barkley took them to the Finals against Jordan and maybe a player can get invited to his poker game (hope he makes a max-level salary!)Orlando MagicPlayers have been known to live on lakes and jet-ski to each other’s houses to play Madden, which sounds like exactly the kind of life I would have liked to have led when I was 17.The weather is really nice and it’s almost tropical.It’s basically Miami, but rednecks instead of Latin people and New York retirees, lakes instead of the ocean, and strip malls and Disney World instead of any semblance of nightlife.
Those D12 teams were underrated (beat Lebron in his prime), but no one has ever said “Dwight Howard did it, so you know it is a good idea.” Some goodwill remains from the Penny-Shaq era. Everyone forgets that T-Mac and Grant Hill played here.THE CITIES THAT SHOULD BE HIGHERAtlanta HawksIt is a mystery why Atlanta is not a more popular NBA city. You would think Atlanta would be at the center of the Venn diagram of where rappers and NBA players want to live. But apparently, NBA players don’t care too much about fraternizing with 2 Chainz, Outkast, Ludacris, Jermaine Dupri, Gucci Mane, Lil Jon, and Young Jeezy.It isn’t San Diego, but the weather is nice. The food is good. You can buy a Southern estate for about the price of a condo in Inglewood. You might be able to get a cameo on The Real Housewives of Atlanta.Freaknik is in Atlanta, even though its heyday has long since passed.It’s at the top of the list of where traveling NBA players play like shit. Atlanta has arguably the best clubs of NBA cities that are not Los Angeles, New York, or Miami.Of course, I have to bring up The Gold Club, where you can feel free to hang around a little bit and talk to them, then leave.It’s one of the two major African-American metropoles in the country.Highlights of the Hawks history are basically limited to the 2015 team getting swept in the conference finals, that time Joe Johnson hit a three, and Dominique Wilkins almost (he should have) beating MJ in the 1988 dunk contest. Maybe that’s why guys don’t want to play here.Washington WizardsAffectionately nicknamed Chocolate City.But basketball has really never mattered in DC outside of Georgetown hoops.THEY ARE REALLY GOOD AT BASKETBALL, BUT THAT’S ABOUT IT:San Antonio SpursWhat would San Antonio be without the Spurs? The answer is El Paso. No one wants to live in El Paso.This is a good reminder that this list does not consider the strength of the present-day organization, but it does factor in the history of the organization.Therefore, the Spurs get a bump for having five titles, four of which no one cares much about. There’s a better chance of Fox News covering a Bernie Sanders rally than Hardwood Classics ever airing a game from the New Jersey Nets and San Antonio Spurs 2003 Finals.San Antonio is, in essence, Dallas or Houston, but they tend to fare worse in the most obese cities rankings, more residents speak Spanish, and the chain restaurants are next to a dirty river.I am not sure any NBA players remember the Alamo.REMEMBER THAT WE ARE NOT FACTORING IN STEPH CURRY:Golden State WarriorsTwo years ago you would probably agree with this placement. Now you probably think I am insane, stupid or both.But in my completely arbitrary and not very well contemplated rules for this exercise, you don’t get to factor in playing with Steph and company, but you do get to factor in the insane current popularity of the franchise, which has been propelled by Steph and company. So – ummm – make sense?Until this ongoing Warriors run, Golden State was akin to Milwaukee west.The years of Run TMC were all too brief and the most prominent superstar (before Steph) claimed by this franchise shot free throws underhand and is widely regarded as the most despised Top-50 player and champion in league history.And as much as tech-bros are popularizing Northern California, NBA players aren’t exactly swayed by the most European of NBA cities. Other than Boris Diaw and Tony Parker, not many NBA guys would enjoy a nice red at a sidewalk café on a foggy San Francisco afternoon and coordinate team day-trips to Napa.BIG CITIES, SHIT IT’S COLD:Chicago BullsThe greatest of all-time wore number 23. No NBA team’s identity is as much ingrained in the image of a single player. The Lakers are the Lakers even without one of Kareem, West, Wilt, Magic, Shaq, or Kobe. The Celtics are the Celtics even without one of Bill Russell, Bird, KG, or Pierce.The Bulls are the Timberwolves without Jordan. MJ has rewritten the history of the franchise so extensively that people forget that they were one of the league’s most dogshit franchises when they drafted Jordan out of North Carolina.To play in Chicago is to follow in Jordan’s footsteps, but unfortunately, the shadow he casts is so large that players are hesitant to fill those Air Jordan’s. Lebron – allegedly – scoffed when Chicago’s pitch to him in 2010 was exactly that. The Bulls sent him a pair of Jordans with an accompanying message: “Do you dare to fill these shoes?” We know how he answered. “Fuck no!” And that seems to be the attitude that modern superstars hold.Why would I go to a team where – no matter what I do and how many championships I win – I’ll never be Michael?Chicago is the pride of the prairie. It’s the grandest American city outside of L.A. or NYC. But it is also the windy city and the most frigid big city in the country, where gusts off of Lake Michigan will literally pain your bones. Unless you are an opera connoisseur, it doesn’t hold much appeal over many of the NBA’s mid-sized cities.There’s a reason in Kanye West’s Good Life, he raps: “The good life, it feel like Atlanta, it feel like L.A., it feel like Miami. It feel like N.Y., summertime Chi, ahhh, now throw your hands up in the sky.”Summertime Chi. As in – great place to play for the Cubs! But stay the fuck away during the NBA season.Boston CelticsHow can the team with the most championships in NBA history be as low as 15? Why are the Celtics ranked below the Bulls when they have 11 more titles?Because even though Boston has the richest basketball history in the NBA, it also has - well - Boston history. Just ask Bill Russell about that.Even if Boston is a more friendly city to African-Americans in 2016 than the city was in 1966, it still has never been a free agent destination. The recent Big 3 era was orchestrated via trades rather than free agency, even if KG ultimately agreed to join Pierce and Jesus Shuttlesworth to win his first and only ring. But he was apprehensive, even calling Bill Russell to seek advice. Boston is a tremendous place to live, to go to college or graduate school, to be Irish, and the optimal place to be if you’re a fan of the Dropkick Murphy’s, where bagpipe-punk ballads are bar staples on far more than just St. Patrick’s Day.Memories of the Garden and Bird and the other several hall-of-famers certainly serves as a strong recruiting factor.But when New England poet Robert Frost poses the question about two roads diverged in a yellow wood, the NBA millionaire is not going to choose either road that leads to the frigid Boston winters, no matter how pretty the foliage when the season begins.Toronto RaptorsIt is Canada. Which is not the United States. Which means it is a pain in the ass to deal with currency conversion. And you have to file taxes (which are higher in Canada) in two separate countries.Toronto is possibly the most metropolitan and lively large North American city outside of New York. Because I have not been to Toronto as an adult, I Googled the best clubs in the city to get a feel for how well those Canada nights complement the life of an NBA star. Number one as of July 2015 was Uniun, which sounds like a failing Vegas club at New York, New York, which not so successfully attempts to emulate some chic Manhattan spot. Here is the description: “Owned by the Ariana Grande of the Toronto club scene, Charles Khabouth…” So yeah, apparently a Lebanese Canadian club owner and hotelier in his fifties is the Ariana Grande of the Toronto club scene. Makes sense.Some other Union gems: BEERS ON TAP: None, but bottles of Heineken, Coors, Corona, and Molson Canadian.BAR SNACKS: None as of yet.WHO GOES THERE: Dressed-up fans of electronic music, beautiful people in their 20s and 30s.That place sounds TERRIBLE. I bet Jonas Valanciunas has a standing table reservation.In Toronto, English is still the primary language. While perhaps too similar to the Bratislava clubs in Eurotrip, there are numerous nightlife options. There is an abundance of diversity. Most importantly for NBA players, there is a Benihana!But it is cold. Really cold. Like colder than Boston, Chicago or New York cold. And if you’re learning anything from this list, it’s that NBA players do not like being in the cold. Which is a primary reason that the Western Conference has been dominant for two decades. Even if NBA players have a debaucherous time on the road when traveling up to The North - it’s hard to shake the perceptions that are formed in childhood. And nearly every NBA player grew up thinking of Canada, even places like Toronto, as an uninhabited frozen wasteland with the occasional igloo and Eskimo. Three years ago Toronto would be ten spots lower on this list, but it’s helpful to have your ambassador and biggest celebrity fan be the most popular rapper on the planet. Drake might be worth more to this franchise than Lebron is worth to Cleveland. MEMPHIS:Memphis GrizzliesIt’s a smaller town than the warmer cities listed above and the weather is less desirable. It’s one of the top cities for BBQ in the country, and perhaps, the best of any NBA city. Beale Street is apparently fun.It is more of a blue-collar city than NBA players typically prefer, but at least it is not in the Rust Belt.  It is rated higher than similarly sized and geographically located cities Charlotte and New Orleans because the grit & grind era gave Memphis a distinct basketball identity that resonates with fans. The three most exhilarating things currently in the NBA are Russell Westbrook attacking the rim at full speed, Steph Curry pulling up from 40 and the Memphis PA system bumping Whoop That Trick during a crucial fourth quarter playoffs timeout. If only NBA players were bigger fans of Elvis.THE GREAT OUTDOORS:Portland TrailblazersThe last remaining frontier of professional basketball in the Great American Northwest. Portland, as a city, has undergone a surge of popularity among America’s twenty-somethings, inspiring such articles as the Washington Post’s Why quirky Portland is winning the battle for young college grads.Oregon has lakes, streams, rivers, trees and picturesque mountains. It also has one of America’s most infamous foodie scenes and thousands of clones of young Bill Walton, albeit the political and socially-conscious new anti-yuppies of Portland lack The Big Redhead’s size and athletic ability. But riding a fixie bike does keep those quads strong.While natural scenic beauty and hiking have not historically been strong sellers to NBA free agents, Portland - or at least nearby Beaverton - does have one thing that turns the heads of young athletes…The Swoosh. The Blazers also boast an NBA title, one of the better logo/color scheme combinations in professional sports, a devoted cult-like local following, and hall-of-famers across multiple generations. If only it did not rain so fucking much.Denver Nuggets I’d personally rather live in Denver than any NBA city outside of Los Angeles, but I reckon I enjoy snowboarding, the mountains and IPAs more than your average professional basketball player. My team-building strategy for the Nuggets would be to target all Euro stars and convince them that living in the mile high city is like residing in an eighties ski movie, which it probably is for Gallinari. Vail and Aspen are surely suitable stand-ins for the Swiss Alps. I would also try to work on getting Kendrick Lamar a residency at Red Rocks. Unfortunately, among the most forgotten teams and players from the eighties were the really fun Fat Lever and Alex English led scoring machines. Fresh in the minds of most players is Melo’s slow and painful mid-season exit and there’s no other recent period in Nuggets history which serves as a draw for free agents.But once the NBA gets out of the weed regulation business and ceases testing for non-performance enhancing drugs and non-narcotics, you can go ahead and bump the Nugs up a spot or ten. THE PROCESS:Philadelphia 76ersThe city of brotherly love is the fifth largest United States city. But just because it is big doesn’t mean that there is anything notable about the town. No one talks about the restaurants or the bars or the museums or anything that has really happened since the 18th century. There is the liberty bell, so that’s cool? Most people only know about Philadelphia because of Ben Franklin book reports in fourth grade. Alllen Iverson was just interviewed by Complex Magazine and said his favorite thing to do in Philly was go to TGI Fridays. But people remember Dr. J and Moses Malone. And more recently, Allen Iverson had his best years in Philly and brought them to the Finals and I am not going to underestimate AI’s impact, as he is up there with Jordan as one of the most iconic and culturally transformative players to ever pick up an orange ball. Too bad Sam Hinkie has worked his hardest to demolish a once proud franchise’s reputation.At least Philadelphia is not Milwaukee or Detroit.NICE CLIMATE, TOO REGIONAL:New Orleans PelicansI don’t have a lot of history to go on here, since The Big Easy has been a permanent NBA town for about a decade. It seems like a pleasant enough place to live. It is inexpensive. The cuisine is excellent. You can hear the best Jazz of your life on an unassuming street corner. You can legally walk down the street with a drink in your hand. You can legally gamble. No one seems to mind if you urinate outside a bar in the French Quarter at five in the morning. There are Southern mansions and a quieter life available in the burbs. Cash Money records reps the 504, but unfortunately, I’m not sure Lil Wayne carries the same weight in 2016 as he did when he ruled the aughts. There’s an NCIS here now. The weather is mostly mild during the NBA season, but the worst natural disaster in United States history likely still looms large in player’s minds. Even if it is home to Mardi Gras and is essentially the Vegas of the American South, it’s still a very small town and that historically has not played well with NBA dudes. I just have the feeling it’s more likely for a player’s bachelor party than it is as a permanent residence. But New Orleans’ place on this list should be revisited in five or so years.Charlotte HornetsEveryone in Charlotte is a bank teller, financial analyst at a large commercial bank, works for the Federal Reserve or worships at the altar of Dale Earnhardt. I am surprised that the professional sports teams in the state don’t have a permanent 3 patched onto the breast of the team jerseys. Charlotte is where SEC and ACC grads end up if they didn’t get jobs in Atlanta.Other than middle-management at a regional office and NASCAR, when I think of Charlotte, one other thing comes to mind - college hoops. Jordan, Worthy, Stackhouse, Vince, Sheed and Dean Smith. Tar Heels versus Blue Devils. Pro basketball has already died once in Charlotte, but was singlehandedly resurrected by the greatest basketball player of all-time who just so happened to be from the state. If MJ was raised in Detroit, L.A. or Chicago, the Charlotte Hornets would be the Seattle Sonics 2.0 or the Kansas City Jayhawks. But every male between 30 and 35 years old, no matter where they grew up in the U.S., had a teal Hornets Starter Jacket. If the Hornets want to increase their free agency rankings, they need to go back to their early-to-mid 90s LJ and Zo throwback attire. They also need to make Grandmama the permanent mascot. And at least for the next five to seven years - the front office can lure free agents with 50 yard line seats to see Cam Newton. FACTORY TOWNS AND KIND OF A CALIFORNIA TOWN:Detroit PistonsThe epicenter of the desolate remains of once proud American manufacturing. If you sign with the Pistons, they may be able to hook you up with a good deal on a Ford Explorer. Living options are between a dilapidated warehouse in downtown Detroit or a 10,000 square foot mansion in a Pleasantville-esque suburb, which are similar to the Northside burbs of Chicago, but if Chicago itself no longer existed and it was even colder. But the Pistons do well with adopting the persona of Detroit toughness. From the Bad Boys to the Billups-Rip-Tayshaun-Sheed-Ben Wallace squad.So a player can feel good about being perceived as a badass, but will soon learn why everyone respects his toughness and resilience, he has to live in Detroit.Sacramento KingsIt sounds appealing to work and live in the capital of California, until you realize that the capital of California is Sacramento.The current Kings arena – Sleep Train (formerly Arco) – is located in a cow pasture.The best thing about Sacramento is the approximate 100 mile distance to Lake Tahoe and 90 mile distance to San Francisco. When your best selling point is being located not that far away from better places, it does not speak all that highly about your city. Sacramento…at least we’re not Barstow.The Maloof bros sold, so there is no longer access to free Vegas depravity.The Webber-Bibby-Peja-Vlade years were fun, but the franchise has since slowly slid into complete chaos and incompetence.They should just ditch the new digs and move to Orange County (which would immediately be a top three free agent destination), where players can live in Newport and Laguna Beach and not have to wait until retirement to hit on cougars at Javier’s.Indiana PacersReggie Miller scoring eight points in nine seconds and miming the choking sign to Spike Lee single-handedly keeps the Pacers out of the bottom of the barrel.Aside from Hoosiers, Bobby Knight, Peyton Manning before the neck, Andrew Luck, Parks and Recreation, the beginning of The Jackson 5 and the non-NASCAR kind of racing, I don’t know much about Indiana. I know Notre Dame is in South Bend, but the Irish pretty much exist independently of the State.Apparently you can fish there, which Roy Hibbert and Paul George taught us that a friendly team fishing expedition can heal deep wounds.So…here we are. Indiana!Cleveland CavaliersI’ll start with the obvious – if I was factoring in playing with Lebron, the Cavs would be near the top of these rankings. Although, Kevin Love and Kyrie Irving might argue differently.Before Lebron Round One, the most iconic Cavs moment was Jordan nailing the double-pump, buzzer beating jumper in the 1989 playoffs and sending Craig Ehlo crying to his knees.During the early Lebron years, the Cavs are most remembered for wilting twice in the playoffs and being subsequently deserted by The King for the number two squad on this list.Cleveland rests on the shores of water so disgusting and polluted, that Lake Erie has caught on fire MULTIPLE times, including the 1969 Cuyohoga fire that played a major role in inspiring the formation of the EPA and the Clean Water Act of 1972. That same fire even had a cameo in Dr. Seuss’ The Lorax.The stench of failure is so strong in Cleveland that the Indians were the franchise chosen to be featured in Major League. Other than Jim Brown, Otto Graham and Lebron, Roger Dorn is probably the city’s most treasured professional athlete.At least there is the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, which is basically a Hard Rock Café without the food.ONE DAY WE SHALL FIND OUT:Oklahoma City ThunderOne of my good friends and former college roommates is from Oklahoma City. His dad is an incredibly nice and smooth man who happens to own an oil and gas business and whose world view is equally shaped by attending college in Austin in the 1970s. If he were so inclined, I’d let him frack in my living room. Here is what he has to say about living in Oklahoma City: We may not have the beach and we may not have the mountains, but people sure smile and say hello when you pass them on the street.While it may have warmth and friendly strangers, I don’t know if that is enough for NBA free agents. And until Durant and Westbrook are no longer in the Sooner State, we will not find out. THAT KG FELLA WAS REAL TENACIOUS, DON’T YA KNOW?:Minnesota TimberwolvesIt is cold in Detroit. It is cold in Milwaukee. It is cold in Chicago. But only one United States city has an entire downtown system of enclosed pedestrian footbridges (Minneapolis Skyway System), so residents can walk in a climate-controlled environment year round. How fucking freezing does it have to be for a city to build an infrastructure so people never have to feel the outside air?Minneapolis is one of the more underrated American cities, but that designation mostly applies between Memorial and Labor Day. A July day on Lake Minnetonka is a Kenny Powers wet dream.But unless you’re an ice fishing enthusiast, there are better places for the young and absurdly rich to spend their winters.It does not help that the most notable retired former Timberwolf is Wally Szczerbiak.Light Beer and Sausages:Milwaukee BucksKareem played here, but after six seasons, forced a trade to the Lakers. In return, the Bucks received four guys I am certain you have never heard of. Oscar Robertson played here, but played the majority of his prime in Cincinnati. Ray Allen played here, but was traded after six and a half seasons along with a collection of spare parts for old Gary Payton (who left the next offseason) and Desmond Mason (who would play two more seasons for the Bucks). Expect to see the Bucks trade Giannis in three years for Deron Williams and Frank Kaminsky.The Bucks did have one of the better forgotten runs in NBA history between the 1970 and 1974 seasons, where they won an average of nearly 61 games per year. Their 1971 championship run led by Kareem and The Big O was among the most dominant in history, where they went 12-2 through the playoffs including a finals sweep.Most outside of Milwaukee forget that the Bucks’ success continued after Kareem and Oscar departed, when Sidney Moncrief led them to a decade of near excellence in the Reagan era. But their strong eighties teams have been greatly overshadowed by those great and better 76ers, Celtics and Pistons squads.  As for the rest of Wisconsin - it is shitty beer, the Packers, cheese, Madison and whatever the hell is going on in Manitowoc County.The New Orleans Jazz Moved to Utah, Where They don’t Allow Music:Utah JazzThe State of Utah is about 61% Mormon and 91% white. Approximately 1.27% of the population is African-American. No other U.S. state that has an NBA team has a smaller African-American population.If the Jazz could guarantee the NBA players/budding film producers that their projects would be admitted to Sundance, they might be able to field a dangerous team. A Baron Davis/Kobe/Lebron core could perhaps secure the 7th seed in the West.The Jazz do boast a rich history and a rabid fan base. But the very smart and talented front office knows that they operate in Utah, so they are better served building through the draft, where you can retain players against their will.",26,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/4cqo0y,NBA City Free Agency Power Rankings,This is dumb,http://reddit.com/r/nba/comments/4cqo0y/c/d1kkqo2,0,2

9700,nba,"In 1940 playing for the University of Wyoming, Kenny Sailors became a sensation with his one handed, jumping into the air release, that is the prototypical jump shot that we are accustomed to today. Sailors came up with the jump shot when he was getting his shot constantly blocked by his older, much taller brother. To get a shot off over his brother, he jumped in the air to release the ball. This has become the norm for NBA players throughout the NBA's history. As a on the ground set shot release would be easily blocked by the league's best athletics in the world.In the now legendary regular season game between Golden State and OKC, Curry was able to get his shot over much taller defenders, a lot of the time the 7 foot Steven Adams, one of the best defender in the league. Two shots stood out in particular (minus the 38"" game winning 3):Pump fake then shot over AdamsFake dribble pass then 3Curry has somehow made the set shot work EVEN BETTER than the jump shot. The advantage of the jump shot is the player is rising in the air as they raise the ball, square up, and line up the shot. To do so on the ground would give the defender ample time to recover and block the shot. But Curry's set shot requires almost zero time to square up before release. How is he doing this? The next generation of players are almost guaranteed to emulate this shot, as it is better than the current ""text book"" model. Anyways, this is something I've been thinking about for a while, thoughts /r/nba?",22,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/48e0z5,Is Steph Curry redefining the Jump Shot?,relax,http://reddit.com/r/nba/comments/48e0z5/c/d0ivms9,0,1

9712,nba,"The play can be seen in full here.  The play starts with Durant clearing out from one corner to the next so the floor is properly spaced in their ""Horns"" formation.    Next, Ibaka steps up to Westbrook and sets a screen and proceeds to fade to the middle of the floor. Westbrook is met by Green ""hedging"" on the pick and roll while Paul recovers, causing (for a brief moment) two players to be on one, obviously leaving someone open.  To compensate for this, Jordan has to direct some of his attention to wherever Ibaka spaces out to, while also tracking his assignment rolling to the rim, Steven Adams.
Because of the divided attention, Redick is also partially responsible for ""tagging"" or ""bumping"" Adams on the roll if necessary. Similarly to Jordan, he also has to keep track of his original assignment in Andre Roberson, but because of his reputation as a poor long-range shooter, Redick assumes his divided attention will not be an issue.  So far, most of the off-ball defensive focus is guided towards whatever decision Westbrook makes, the most worrisome to the Clippers being an open Ibaka jumper. Their weak-side off-ball defenders are all prepared to move in response to this.  Knowing this, Roberson identifies the very moment which Jordan steps up a bit too much towards Ibaka (and to an extent, anticipating a rotation to cover for Paul getting beat by Westbrook off the dribble), causing Redick to step up to Adams. Because of this, Redick is no longer tracking him and Roberson cuts to the rim for an easy lob.  A couple times every game, OKC likes to send reminders to the opposition that Roberson still has to be treated as an off-ball threat, even though he is a poor three point shooter. In the grand scheme of things, maybe a backdoor lob doesn't change the game in itself, but the Thunder sure as hell hope it makes the defense worry about entirely loading up on the strong side ball-handler in pick and rolls.",23,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/4a078v,[OC] How OKC was able to make Roberson an effective off-ball Pick & Roll player for 1 play,It's all about tipping scales in your favour and leveraging weird advantages  ,http://reddit.com/r/nba/comments/4a078v/c/d0waruc,147,0

9718,nba,"The Raptors finished the first half with a ten-point lead over the Rockets in what looked like a pretty ordinary game between a fringe playoff team and a conference final contender.The Rockets came into the second half and didn’t do anything drastically different schematically and as a result, allowed the Raptors to extend their lead fifteen points by the eight-minute mark.The monumental difference that occurred at that moment was the substitution that took Donatas Motiejunas out of the game in exchange for Corey Brewer, which slotted the 6’9, 186 pound swingman at the nominal Power Forward position. Corey Brewer would not check out of the game for the remaining 16 minutes and in that time he was a +20.This allowed the Rockets to do numerous things, both offensively and defensively.DefenseThe main deterrent when placing a wing at the nominal Power Forward spot is that it may leave the smaller defending team with a mismatch when it comes to post ups. Oddly enough, the Raptors have the perfectly weird combination of Valanciunas and Scola where that actually might be an issue.To combat the potential mismatch that would lead to Scola posting up any of the Houston wings, the Rockets chose to assign their most infamous defender in James Harden to defend Scola. Harden possesses some positive traits as a post defender, mainly that he has an incredibly strong base for a guard. Additionally, when the Rockets put Harden on Scola, they also decided they would double as soon as the ball entered the post, allowing for one of three speedy defenders to pressure Scola into tough decision making.https://streamable.com/e/vteeScola had to face very quick and long defenders as well as having only one legitimate three-point threat on the floor to pass to. Even if you can consider DeMar a threat to attack from the perimeter upon a close out, the remaining two non-shooters (Valanciunas and Johson) make that decision very hard for Scola and it showed.The Rockets’ aggressive defense didn’t end there. They leveraged their quickness and ability to rotate and recover by doubling the primary ball-handlers (Lowry and DeRozan) on high pick and rolls. The previously mentioned lack of shooting, as well as playmaking made those scenarios very difficult.https://streamable.com/e/65d5
Even when the Raptors were able to dump the ball off to the open 4-man, the Rockets were tremendous in their rotations, further proving that Houston can really be a great defensive team when they want to be.OffenseOne of the primary incentives of “going small” is that it allows the offensive team to have more shooters on the court, therefore opening up the possibility of a “Spread Pick and Roll”. As long as the 5-man sets a solid screen for the ball-handler, causing penetration into the middle of the floor, the remaining 3 defenders will be tasked with guarding 4 players, all of which are threats to score. The Rockets executed this to perfection.https://streamable.com/e/9i5fThe Rockets spiced things up offensively by not just resorting to high pick and rolls, rather, they used DHO’s (dribble hand-offs) to add variety to their offense. By doing so, they did not allow the Raptors to settle in and specifically target something schematically.Yes, the Raptors had some very notable mistakes which are concerning by themselves, but having no answer for 3 shooters surrounding a high pick and roll only exacerbated any of the actual issues and made them more impactful than they had to be. Additionally, the lack of speed from the front court positions also became glaringly clear because of the added three point threats.While the Raptors did not have a great opportunity to change their defensive scheme against the Harden/Howard pick and roll, they certainly could have to the Harden/Brewer combination that terrorized them. The Raptors chose to “hedge” on all pick and rolls as well as DHO’s involving that pairing, while deploying a lineup that consisted of either Luis Scola or Patrick Patterson at the 4-spot. Due to current personnel restraints, the Raptors chose to not match up with another wing against Brewer. This left a slower and less agile defender assigned to Brewer. This is some of the carnage that ensued as a result of the pick and roll defense.https://streamable.com/e/j5b8It could have been so much worse. Corey Brewer shot 5/10 from three point range and some of those misses were awful after great looks given by the Raptors’ schematic choices and Harden’s great passing.https://streamable.com/e/8dwcThis isn’t to say that Brewer wasn’t also hot, he most certainly was.
Some combination of quickness as well as having the hot hand led to him scoring some doozies of the bounce.https://streamable.com/e/1vspHowever, Corey Brewer being hot for the first 20 minutes should lead someone to believe that continuous open looks will only lead to disaster for the remaining 10, which it did.The Raptors could’ve done things differently. They could have doubled Harden on every high pick and roll and made him dish it to the rolling Brewer/Howard/Capela. They could’ve given some spot minutes to Norman Powell and played 4 guards and 1 big, allowing them to switch more pick and rolls. He had played well in Portland and in his brief first half stint, against Houston he continued his solid defensive outing, yet he was a no-show in the second half. They could have even put Patterson/Scola on any other of the Rockets’ wings (Terry, Ariza, Beverly) just so the Rockets would have had to feel uncomfortable with new screening partners every possession, and who knows, they might have even got lucky with one of the new screeners getting cold.
Instead, Toronto played Houston pretty much the same the entire second half even when there were obvious examples of their defensive scheme not working. If any team should know the difficulties of hedging on every pick and roll, it’s the Raptors! They overhauled their coaching staff for that very purpose as they moved towards ICEing this past summer.Some simple experimentation was all that was necessary. I doubt it could’ve gone worse than what actually happened in the second half.

9842,nba,"As you may know, the Atlanta Hawks have made the playoffs every season since 2007-2008, and are on the verge of clinching their 9th consecutive playoff appearance.However, something happened in the 2008 season that changed the fortunes of the Hawks. In on Dec. 19, 2007, a scorekeeper incorrectly said Shaquille O'Neal fouled out, even though he only had 5 fouls. The Atlanta Hawks won the game in OT 117-111, but the Heat were able to protest and force a replay on March 8, 2008.After replaying the last 51.9 seconds of the game, the end result was again a Hawks win, albeit by a score of 114-111.However, Shaquille O'Neal (traded to PHX for Shawn Marion and Marcus Banks) was not available for the replay, even though he was the reason the Heat were able to force a replay in the first place. Although there was a replay and the Hawks won ""again"", would the results have been different if Shaq was still on the team (or even available just for the replay) instead of Shawn Marion and Marcus Banks?If the Hawks had lost the game, their final record would have dropped to 36-46, placing them in a tie with Indiana for the 8th and final playoff spot. The Pacers, who had the head-to-head advantage against the Hawks that year (2-1) would have made the playoffs and played the 1-seed and eventual champion Boston Celtics.The Phoenix Suns, who owned Atlanta's draft pick that year, would have been able to select in the lottery at pick #11 (assuming the lottery played out the same). Jerryd Bayless was chosen at this spot. Phoenix may have opted to select Bayless at this spot as the successor to Nash, and not have made a draft-day trade to select Goran Dragic. The Pacers would have selected at #15, where the Suns originally chose Robin Lopez. It's possible that Indiana would select Lopez at this spot, passing on two-time all star (how Sway) Roy Hibbert. But unlikely. Would Atlanta have continued on this long streak of playoff appearances had they not made the playoffs? Would this playoff appearance have sparked Indiana, and caused them to miss out on the chance to select Paul George? Do we have free will? Who knows.Edit: 
I was inspired by this threadHighlights of the Dec. 19 2007 gameIncorrect play-by-play from 12/19/07 - ESPNCorrect play-by play from 12/19/07 - BBREF A foul with 3:24 in the 4th quarter was erroneously attributed to Shaquille O'Neal, when in fact it was Udonis Haslem who fouled Marvin Williams. TL;DRBecause a game between the Hawks and Heat had to be replayed without the original players (notably Shaq missing for Miami), the 2008 playoffs were affected, and Atlanta, not Indiana ended up with the last playoff spot. What effects this may have had on the playoff future of Atlanta, Indiana, and how it could have affected the draft are interesting things to explore.

If you're not about those advanced stats; per game Jokic averages more rebounds, assists, and steals. Per 36 he averages more everything except blocks.

Over time I decided to watch the Bulls play every game, then Rose got injured and I figured I'd skip that nights game. So I guess I'm not really a Bulls fan, but a fan of Derrick Rose instead. I watch other teams like the Cavaliers, Thunder, Spurs, Warriors play most of their games because I want to watch the best play, and I'm a fan of watching big time teams play the Sport well. So I'm a fan of the Cavaliers as well. On top of this, I'm from San Diego. So I suppose I should be a Clippers or maybe a Lakers fan?

10137,nba,"Maybe the real ""problem"" with the Cavs isn't Kevin Love ""fitting in instead of fitting out"" or Kyrie Irving being ""unhappy and wanting out of Cleveland,"" but rather LeBron's (low-key) quest to catch/pass Kareem on the all-time scoring list. Perhaps the way the Cavs win is by LeBron switching from a primary scorer to THE primary facilitator. What if LeBron became more like Magic and less like MJ? If you think about it it makes a ton of sense:1.) With LeBron focused primarily on playmaking on the offensive end, Kyrie could move over to the role of primary scorer (adjusting to his strengths and allowing him to compete for scoring titles) and Love could shift over to the role of the secondary option (he's been, by far, at his best in Cleveland in that role).2.) LeBron is an ELITE passer and has the ability to lead the NBA in assists, while still putting up points as a third scorer (see Love's current rate of ~17-18pnts) and allowing him to still get his All Star, All NBA, MVP love. (He's always said he was more like/been most favorably compared to Magic.)3.) LeBron could focus more energy on D which, while no longer his strongest attribute, he remains more than capable playing D at a high level -- and he's still one of the most versatile defenders in the entire NBA. Plus, given that D is weakest area for both Love and Kyrie, more effort from LeBron could help get the Cavs back to their top 5 defensive from earlier this season.4.) Such a move would address the elephant in the room: LeBron is nearing the end of his prime and the incredible stress he's put on his body/continues to put on his body -- with the number of minutes he plays and, importantly, his style of play -- is catching up to him. Exerting less energy on the offensive end could prolong his career on the back end.5.) Even if LeBron doesn't ultimately catch Kareem (or MJ or Malone or Kobe) in scoring, he'd still get close. And neither MJ nor Kobe ever led the league in assists (or averaged double-digit assists, for that matter). And Magic never won a scoring title (which LeBron already did). In other words, his argument for GOAT would be as strong (arguably stronger) -- especially if the Cavs were to win 2-3 chips).Still don't think it makes sense? Go back and look at Magic's great Lakers teams of the 80's/early 90's. By way of examples: Magic was the #3/#4 scoring option on the '80 (18pnts) and '82 (18.6pnts) championship teams, and the #2/#3 scoring option on the '88 (19.6pnts) championship team. Because of his assists/playmaking, however, he still got All Star, All NBA, MVP, and Finals MVP love in some/all of those seasons. LeBron could easily average 18pnts (in his sleep) and, with all the offensive firepower at his disposal, could very likely lead the NBA in assists as well. Throw in improved D and he'd still be at/near the top of the MVP conversation while remaining a shoe-in for All Star and All NBA. Plus, like Magic, he could turn it on in the playoffs and during the Finals (as needed).Fun Fact(s): Magic won the last of his 5 chips in 1988. Byron Scott led that Lakers in scoring during the regular season (~22pnts) and James Worthy led that Lakers team in scoring during the playoffs (~21pnts). Magic still dropped ~20pnts and ~12assts a game that season, was an All Star and First Team All NBA, and almost won MVP (he finished 3rd) and Finals MVP (he, arguably, should have won).http://www.basketball-reference.com/teams/LAL/1988.html",26,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/48iz6v,LeBron needs to play more like Magic and less like MJ in order for the Cavs to win a Championship,https://twitter.com/magicjohnson/status/693172654082121728,http://reddit.com/r/nba/comments/48iz6v/c/d0jxiwp,0,0

10304,nba,"Curry is a palm shooter. So why is this interesting? Well, if you've ever played or have ever went through the process of shooting the ""correct"" way, then you know that this is apparently a HUGE no-no. Steph Curry even teaches you not to do this by saying you need to have a little ""daylight"" between the ball and your palmAnother thing that is interesting (which is in teh same video) is his hand placement on the ball when going up for the shot. His index finger and his thumb make a little V while he's holding the ball and going into his shotSo keeping these two things in mind, I (of course) went outside and put up shots for about 4 hours going between this form and what I was doing before just to see what the difference is. The difference is actually noticeableMy hand placement is the traditional shit they teach you. Pretty much what any player would teach you. Keep the ball on those finger pads at the base of your fingers and keep your hands pretty much wide open. It's a form that most players have, but not the form the greatest shooter of all time hasSo when I let my index and thumb form a V and rested the ball on my palm..it felt weird, but my shots seemed better. This part is going to be super anecdotal (obviously) but I'll explain it anyways.I don't have small hands. I can palm the ball. If I spread my fingers out while shooting, I do seemingly have more control of the ball but it feels like I'm palming it. It's very hard to relax with my fingers all spread out, and if I spread them out and try to keep them on the pads under my fingers, then it really feels like I'm just palming the ball for the shot. I feel like a ton of guys fall into this category. Even by doing this, I can still make shots, but sometimes when I miss shots it seems like 1 finger made a world of difference when it shouldn't have. Logically that makes sense. If you involve your fingers throughout the duration of your shot, and your fingers aren't consistent, then you're going to miss shots or barely make shotsBack to Steph. Now if you were to open your hand wide, or even somewhat wide, as if you were going to shoot the ball then you'll notice 2 things. One you won't be able to have a V between your index and thumb. Depending on how wide you open, you'll turn that V into a very wide U, so what does that tell you? That tells you that Steph doesn't open his hand as wide as possible. He doesn't even come close to that. This part is importantThe next thing to notice when you spread your fingers out is your wrist. You definitely won't think about this while actually shooting and you probably won't think about it now...but when you begin to open your fingers up you add a fuckton of tension in your wrist. There's no way in hell you can open your hand without feeling tension. Since Curry (from what I see) doesn't open his fingers wide at all (because his thumb and index maintain a V throughout his form) then Curry's wrist is super relaxed and this is the first thing I noticed when checking out his shotAs far as the palm shooting goes, I noticed that I got more fingers involved when shooting from my palm. A lot of people say that shooting from the palm is  bad because it can fuck with your accuracy and your arc,but that's so vague. Without telling exactly how that fucks with your accuracy...should you really believe it? I sure as hell don't. Some shots, at first, were going flat, but I'm not new to this. All I did was slightly raise the ball from my normal set point and that fixed the flat shotNow something I noticed with shooting from the palm is that you honestly can't just shoot from the palm. What happens is that the moment you feel the ball on your palm and go into your shot, you shift the ball to a very comfortable position on your finger pads and as you release the ball the shot will look pretty much normal, and this is why I think Curry doesn't think he shoots on his palm. Watching his shot at normal speed doesn't show any signs of shooting from the palm because his palm is really just the pocket that holds the ball for a tiny second. This pocket, imo, is much better than keeping the ball off your palm the entire timeSo instead of people worrying about whether or not the ball is, or isn't, on the palm of the hand, people need to talk about tension in their wristYou ever look at Dwight and DeAndre's form and be like ""they look like they can shoot..but they just can't""? Well take a look at this. Look at what Dwight does right before he brings the ball up to shoot. Dwight does what I've been doing for years. Dwight does what he's been taught. He spreads his fingers out before raising the ball because he's been taught to have your fingers spread and have the ball on your pads. If you don't see it, put it in slow motion. He first has the ball positioned, but then he does a very subtle readjustment of his thumb (you can tell because of how he slightly picks his thumb up and puts it down. If you're going into your shot with a set form then you don't need to do this. He does this to spread his fingers out a bit more, so he basically palms the ball)Now look at Dwight here shooting casual free throws. Look at before he brings the ball up, you see that V? You see how relaxed his hand is? Whether or not he actually made that shot is one thing, but I'm willing to bet he did make itHere's another video of Dwight shooting. If you watch the free throws before that one, you see how relaxed his hand is (even tho he still adjusts it before the shot) but with this specific shot you see how he tenses up before the shot. That tension causes the miss. At 56 seconds in the same video you see the same thingSo enough with Dwight, back to Curry. I think Curry has realized that the most important thing about shooting is having a relaxed hand. Even when you think your hand is relaxed when shooting right now, I guarantee you can relax it even more by not spreading it and allowing your palm to cup the ball to help balance before the shot. Although everyone teaches against this...I'm really beginning to think this is the way to go. You shouldn't have to spread any fingers out or anything, just keep it relaxed and once you put the ball in your hand, your fingers will naturally spread and keep your wrist super relaxedI think his relaxed wrist is why he's so consistent. If you're always shooting from a relaxed hand, then you don't have to worry about its consistency. Do you know how easy it is to replicate being relaxed? But it's very difficult to replicate spreading your fingers. How far do you spread? Do you spread all the way? Are you even sure you spread all the way out on your last shot?The more I look into his shot, the more I realize how simple it is. From his feet, knees, hand, wrist, set point, and all that shit..his shot is all about being relaxed. It's very easy to replicate that relaxed feeling because that's the feeling you want when you do anything...and that's what I think makes him the greatest shooter we'll ever see, and as long as coaches continue to teach the older way of shooting...I highly doubt we'll ever see another Curry",50,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/4ab48x,Something interesting about Curry's shot (and a little on Dwight's free throw shooting form),Agree with you absolutely about being relaxed. ,http://reddit.com/r/nba/comments/4ab48x/c/d0yvlqi,168,9

10427,nba,"After a down season last year Rondo has bounced back and is putting up some impressive numbers again. Despite losing some speed to his knee injury, he's having the second best year of his career, and still seems to be in his prime. 2015/2016 Rondo:11.9 points / 12.1 assists / 6.4 rebounds / 2 steals on   .474/.349/.567 shooting splits. Obviously the shooting is pretty ugly, especially free throws, but it always has been. His overall fg% is .449 this year. Compare that to his best year, 2012/2013:13.7 points / 11.1 assists / 5.6 rebounds / 1.8 steals on    .513/.240/.645 splits. Overall fg% was .484. A little more scoring, and more efficiently, but not a massive difference overall, with the extra assist and rebound. His current year is actually almost identical to his 2011/2012 season, which is considered part of his prime. His game doesn't really too much on athleticism so it might age well. I think Rondo is basically going to be a 12/12/6/2 guy for the next few years. He also brings strong leadership to his team and can be a great roaming defender when he's locked in. Right now he's leading the league in assists by 1.8 per game, he's 8th overall in steals, and he's the second best rebounder in the NBA for his position. Obviously guys like Curry, CP3, and Westbrook are way better than him, but who else do you definitively put above him after that? I too am sick of the constant posts ranking players. But Rondo has always been one of my favorite players and it's exciting to see him bounce back to basically his prime numbers after the whole sub was trashing him last year. Is he a top 10 pg again?

On Bledsoe - The guy is injured. He's obviously Tier 3 level, but we don't know what will happen when he comes back.
On Antetokounmpo - He's a monster at the moment, but if you watch the games, you see that it's still hard to run a team when the PG attracts to defender beyond 18 feet. He also hasn't played too many games at PG.
On Kyrie - The guy can score, but what else can he do? He's really bad at running a team, and horrible on defense. I think Kyrie is one of the most special and gifted player on the planet, but he hasn't developed since his rookie year. He might be the same player from Duke tbh.
On Rose - The guy has gotten a lot better since January. Overall, he has been pretty horrible though. The guy will probably end up moving up a lot next year granted he stays healthy.
On Rondo - He's really good skill wise, but he has a lot of flaws to his game and he doesn't try to win games. It's pretty embarrassing. Tier 3.5 caliber player.  Certain players that I believe to be better players are lower than other players based on limited minutes, role, and system they play in. For instance, I think Patty Mills is a much better player than Payton, yet he plays in a much better system and also has a easier role. He could move up a lot if I had a different measure.  I forgot to name some players such as Dcol, Douglas, and etc. Slot them in as you wish.  Tier 0/1 are superstars.
Tier 2 are stars.
Tier 3 are borderline stars/very good players. 
Tier 4 are players that can get all the way to Tier 2/3, but either are injured or playing below their usual levels.
Tier 5 are good players.
Tier 6 is when you seriously want an upgrade if they start for your team.
Tier 7 lord help you. Of course Mudiay and D'lo won't be in Tier 7 for that much longer, will probably both peak at Tier 2/3 level.
Thoughts? I watch all the teams a good bit, but I'm sure fans that watch all the games of a particular team might have different thoughts.  EDIT
I missed a lot of players such as Dcol, Mack, Pat Bev, Lawson, and etc. This was just a quick off the dome type of thing.

10504,nba,"I'm on the older side (43), but I'm tired of all this hand-checking talk lately.  I decided to try to look into it a bit.  A standard way baseball analytics folks look across era is to look at year-to-year changes with players who span both years.If you do something similar for hand-checking, you'd expect to see some major changes in numbers.  You'd expect certain players to go from ho-hum to just dropping GOAT numbers.  The crazy thing is, this didn't happen.  Players played largely the same way they did the year before hand-checking appeared.  Steve Nash is someone who in theory would have gained the most from the rule change, but in the first year of the rule change his scoring average goes up by exactly 1 ppg.  And surprisingly his turnovers increase by .5 ppg (you'd think they'd go down without handchecking).  Player after player, you see remarkably consistent performance before and after the hand-checking rule.  And if you look at the leading scorers before and after the rule change, the scoring amounts are about the same -- with one aberration of Kobe Bryant's one year of 35ppg (which drops immediately the year after).So if you look at the data that shows the same players playing with and without the rule, you'll see that offensive productivity didn't magically just change.  With all the talk about the rule making it super easy for offensive players, it apparently was never really exploited until Steph Curry (to hear the old-timers tell it).  If this is really true, he deserves even more credit than he's been given -- as he is about the only player to exploit something that apparently everyone thought was exploitable.",26,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/491459,The impact of hand-checking,"yeah, illegal defense changers had a much bigger impact than hand-checking.",http://reddit.com/r/nba/comments/491459/c/d0o8tj6,50,7

People said that Pat Riley didn't let him do that in Miami and kept him in check, which is what allowed Miami to thrive, because he was forced to obey the guidance of Spolestra, just like every other player. However, Cavs organization seems to bend to his will, and it's unlikely that there would be a coach that would be able to disagree with Lebron and not cause tension. That being said, Lebron has a brilliant basketball mind. He's talked about visualizing games, and you know he has plays and ideas for the game flowing through his head. He's shown himself to be a powerful leader that the organization rallies around and prides himself on. He's essentially hand picked his teammates as well, so he has a system in mind for how he expects it all to work out. If there was that clear guidance in Lebron as a player-coach, perhaps chemistry issues would disappear, and the Cavs can find their working system?If you DO agree to this theory, then is there any reason why the Cavs can't hire a figurehead head coach, but have Lebron be the de facto head coach?",27,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/4ckl49,Serious question: Do you think the Cavaliers would have less chemistry issues if Lebron became an official player-coach?,"LeBron should just be the head coach, but wear his Cavs jersey underneath his suit and tie.

10812,nba,"When a player is on an NCAA tournament hot streak like the one Oklahoma’s Buddy Hield is on, NBA scouts have to ask if they can believe what they are seeing. In terms of predicting a pro career, success in March means nothing — for every Kemba Walker, there’s a Shabazz Napier fighting to stay in the league. So what are we really seeing with Buddy?Hield is averaging 25.4 points per game, the highest scoring average by a player entering the Final Four since Georgia Tech’s Dennis Scott in 1990. Coming off a 37-point Elite Eight performance against the 1-seed Oregon Ducks on Saturday, his stock is so high that some are wondering whether the Sooners wing, projected as a second-rounder after his junior season, could go first in the upcoming NBA draft.The question facing the scouts is simple: Whom has Buddy been beating to get these numbers? There aren’t a lot of great teams in this tournament, and there aren’t a lot of great prospects in this year’s draft class. Most of his peers — Hield is 22 years old — are already in the NBA.Hield hasn’t faced great talent this season. He matched up with Villanova’s Josh Hart in nonconference play, and the best Big 12 competition he saw (aside from Baylor’s Taurean Prince, who was playing zone defense) came from Wesley Iwundu (Kansas State) and Wayne Selden Jr. (Kansas).However, it’s not so much who is guarding Hield as it is whom he is guarding. The best way to slow down a scorer is to attack his legs on defense, and Hield hasn’t faced many players (or any) who can do that. In the NBA, it doesn’t matter how many points you can score if you’re giving them right back on the other end of the floor.Hield has the physical tools to be a good defender. At 6-foot-4, 215 pounds, with a 6-foot-8 wingspan, he has prototypical 2-guard size. And while he’s not an elite athlete, he’s not going to get blown off the court.The Sooners advancing to the Final Four gives scouts a chance to see Hield throw down against better competition. A win over Villanova (and another round with Hart) would mean a game against either North Carolina’s Justin Jackson or Syracuse’s Malachi Richardson and Michael Gbinije, all three of whom are 6-foot-6 (at least) NBA-caliber athletes with the ability to challenge Hield on both sides of the ball.At the next level, everyone Hield will face will be as good (and likely better) as those guys. How he performs against his Final Four foes could be the truest predictor of how he’ll fare in the NBA.",45,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/4cb32j,Can we believe in Buddy Hield?
