It was rough the first couple of games but he has answered out Point Guard problems for the most part. Once he clicked we won 10 of 11 games with him averaging career highs across the board. Almost had a triple double a few games ago. he's been really great fit for us. I wish he would take a couple of less shots but he is really good with this team.`\aw yeah boy`\I'm so glad we got Lyles. He fits the system well and we needed a stretch 4. `\the last game @ LA is actually the last game of the season and it is against Utah

Kobe's shot form looks broken. He is shooting on the downside of his jump.

Also these kids are running around with basketball like headless chicken. Under normal circumstances Kobe would have murdered every one of them.

The Jazz were on a little run, so Kerr probably sent him in to preserve the lead. `\No I didn't, but I've seen most the games since the all star break. I'm not saying he doesn't make them, they used to just be seemingly guaranteed. Like Harping's catch and shoot curl around the the free throw line was. I haven't felt confident in his shot for a bit now. He still a beast no doubt. `\fitz sounds like a kid bragging about his dad on the playground.

What is this`\Yeah but I want Hood to break the record. `\lol, because you don't want them to beat a record that your franchise got 20 years ago.

I'm scurred ! ! !`\They got blown out in the 1st quarter and then the rest of the game the Blazers outscored the Cavs by 7. It isn't like they just stopped playing. JR went 1-6, Mo Williams went 0-6, Mozgov went 1-4, Jones went 3-8, and Shump went 2-8. If those guys were making shots they wouldn't have been down 22 after the 1st quarter. `\I am!

Steph went full Rondo in this game...`\He's in the doghouse, but there's no officially stated reason why.  Probably because the Jazz have made a decision not to resign, so Snyder sees no reason to keep playing him.  His defense is bad, his shooting is streaky.  But he's been a solid pro about the entire thing.`\Oh man I guess you proved me wrong. No bandwagon fans here.`\Speights, Barnes, and Varejao were absolutely dreadful tonight.

what if mo speights is actually good?`\10 assists is solid but nothing spectacular. Couple that with meh shooting and turnovers and I think it cheapens the word to call it a "great" game. Compared to his usual this was a poor game for Curry`\Hornacek's in the rafters, AK should be too, imo.  At the very least 47 should never be worn by a Jazz player again.`\Who doesnt`\Sorry? GG.`\Neither of them compare to favors, and exum and burks are intangible.`\I can only assume that it would make sense if Gobert is affected more than Burke.`\But better `\wait what?? was it a heave or something?`\He doesn't have the mind. He just totally relied on his athleticism. `\Ball is life.`\That dang GSW small ball from the 4Q onward killed the Jazz, and the Jazz buried themselves with missed FTs.`\shaun livingston is fucking money`\FUCK CURRY WHAT THE FUCK`\He averaged just over 10 points per game, nothing stellar overall.`\I feel like Hoods made more 3s in this game than AK did in his career `\Idk I expected him to shoot a 3 after hesitating for so long..surprised he passed. `\FUCKING HELL FUNDAMENTALS YOU DUMB FUCKING CUNTS`\You brave, naive soul`\Some dude in this thread bet on Jazz +14... his asshole is clenched.`\The 10 assists are great.`\Hhhhhnnnnggggg les go`\Lol hel str8 trash the Rockets everytime`\Really? Another bad call lol.
edit: Ball don't lie. That was no charge.`\Here we go`\Yo if this game doesnt get Byron fired i dont know what will...`\Wow big shot Klay`\To be clear I meant no disrespect, the Jazz have been great aside from FTs. It's crazy that this even went to OT.

Note: Data from basketball-reference, March 9th. Data from ranges 0-3,3-10,10-16,16-<3pt,3p are plotted to the midpoint of the range. For example, FG% for 0-3 is plotted at 1.5 feet, 3-10 at 6.5, 10-16 at 13, 16-<3pt at 19.875. 3pt% is plotted at 23.75 however. The curves in between ARE NOT to be used to extrapolate data accurately, it merely shows the *trend* between separate points, as the area under the curves divided by a unit length will not provide the FG% for the range as an average value.`\If we have already locked up our playoff position can we agree to rest the teams and make hood and kobe play 1v1 to 21 (1s and 2s make it tske it)`\So since LAL beat GS, and UTA beats LAL, that means UTA > GS right?

# RGiss's (Jazz) Keys to the game:

1. **Guard interior well.** Golden State shoots 29.2 of their shots from inside of the restricted area on average. If we can limit their easy shots, we should be able to limit their scoring.

2. **Break up passing lanes/Force ISO.** The Warriors score 68.5% of their buckets assisted. (Best in NBA) If they aren't passing the ball well, than their offense isn't working well.

3. **Shoot the 3 well.**  Warriors Opponents shoot 33.1% from three on average; In the Warriors losses this season, the opponent shoots 41.4% from three.

We just get embarrassed by the spurs`\And ESPN is praising Kobe for holding Hood to 0 points in the 3rd.`\What did steve Kerr just put into his mouth ? `\I'm loving this game`\Just rewatching some parts of the game. And its so nice to have Iggy back. One of the problems in the last couple games has been turnovers due to active hands from the defense. There was this one play in the game where Barnes (?) passes the ball to Iggy, it looks like its going to be wide and go back court, but Iggy actually see's that its wide, he reacts and hustles toward where the ball will actually be. So nice.`\Not much salt in this thread....too much in SLC?`\No. I'd rather have a Jazz win than OT. `\getting ready for friday's game`\Jazz offense hasn't been great but im worried :/`\Blows my mind.`\great pass nene`\Give him a T`\our small ball is completely in their heads on d`\he's just adorable. and his bromance with barbosa just warms my heart`\Kobe took that first half personally.

Off the TT turnover, Lebron makes no fucking effort to get back on defense leading to the easy transition layup.  Shit like that - it's a fucking 15 point game and just the 1st quarter, you don't give up like that.  That's just embarassing.

Did you watch the game?  `\Is that an actual stat? `\Because Neto is even worse lol.`\We're like 2 games out of the 7th spot and we've had so many injuries this year lol.... I'd say that's pretty impressive we are still within reach of making the playoffs.`\The Warriors have looked so off for a long time. `\Goddamn, people were so worried about Curry 70 feet from the basket, it gave them a layup`\LOL Beasley just did the cooking celebration on the Celtics`\really? do other Warriors fans feel this way?`\Franchise low?!`\What if that one block is what shatter's Steph's confidence and derails his season o.o`\he looks like hes on fire in NBA jam. hes in full godneymode`\That was the joke, indeed. `\I think you dropped this #`\Derrick Favors is shooting an even 80% from the free throw line since the break.

All their strengths: deliberate, slow pace, excellent/disciplined  defense, ball movement cause problems for the Warriors

As long as they don't turn the ball over and get the lead, they'll be hard to beat`\i always have that feeling`\I found myself watching more and more games on the Jazz's opponents feeds lately. I like this announcing team. They have one of the greatest jobs in the world watching the Dubs this year, and they just seem calm and happy about it. No real bias, just solid broadcasting.

The Lakers' announcers were so good the other night too. They've had a long ass season with that team, but they announced that 48 point loss with grace and humility. Would love to hear them call all the Jazz games.

Rockets' announcers, well, let's just say the Rockets get what they deserve with that broadcast team. `\still 57-55 in denver. teams havent scored in 3 minutes`\fuck`\At least 17`\I mean we got the turnover.

I might as well go see the other team go off on them smh.`\Fuckkkkk Frye. `\I hope Kobe gets some use out of our present. :)`\And the choke sets in`\I'll admit usually Cavs announcers drive me nuts but they were making me laugh at the end of the 3rd`\Curry bolted off the court after making it from half court, like "I'm so fucking hard right now where's my wife" `\i can't believe he's even knocking down all these threes now. what is happening `\Save us....HB?`\I'm having so much fun.`\Whats the point of living guys? `\Yeah bring them back!`\Good stream?`\He is good, but we got clarkson at the 46...only Sacramento can top that in recent memory with Thomas as the last pick`\we also have RSL

edit: world champions RSL`\These guys are fantastic. So complimentary. Super classy and really enjoyable to listen to. `\Cmon curry. You're better than that.`\WTTFFFFFF`\I don't watch Jazz games very often this year (I learned my lesson the past couple seasons).  The last time I saw a win was well over 2 months ago.

Being a Jazz/Rams fan fucks me up.  I can't even imagine what it would be like to be emotionally invested in postseason sports.`\This is exactly how it will go down.`\LOL`\Hayward and Russell must've been partying together last night.`\The worst part is that nothing will ever change with the Wizards.

They will always fail. `\sitting in my apartment in the bay area i got hit by one of the free throws shot in this game`\We started doing out part, then these jazz fuck heads fucked everything up`\I really want Hayward to have a monster game to bring his scoring average back over 20ppg. `\Lol Curry's mad when he had his arm on him the entire time he was driving `\That as well as his good passing and a possible blowout occuring, then I can see it ending, although he will probably hit one. `\There's a difference between fist-pumping because you're happy and fist-pumping because you're pissed at the ref...`\It would be fun as hell to do that and take live calls from streamers during intermissions. I'm going to do some research on how to do this.`\Do yall like Harpring? `\yo how can we bring the worst possible elevator music to the stream breaks?

Even from like 30 feet I think many elite guys could drain 70%+`\Eh... I dunno man. I mean he intentionally moved that way. And he hit Frye in the nuts. But I don't think he intentionally moved that way to hit Frye in the family jewels. I've only been watching trey this year so I don't know him personally or anything, but he hasn't struck me as the kind of guy to pop another man's sack on purpose. `\Oh Rudy....

Seemingly over but then a bolt of adrenaline.`\It's pretty simple. Even though Hood has been playing worse than my white ass, he draws a lot of offensive attention with the way he's shown he can play. Really opens the court for Hayward/Favors. I see no way we lead at all in this game past 6:00 into it unless Favors and Hayward combine for 60. `\Yeah honestly, the bias bump that winning teams get because their fans are the ones hitting r/nba post-game doesn't need any more fuel.

I feel like the Warriors are almost sand bagging at this point, Iggy is going to be fresh as a *daisy* for the playoffs. `\DRAYMOND JAM`\Poor Jazz, and I think the only reason this game made it to ESPN is because of the hype from last year post-AS and Hayward's game winner against the Cavs.

SEGABABA on the ROAD and 4 in 6, we are missing plenty of pieces ourselves, and we have faced every single team's best effort this year. We have not lost to many "good" teams this year, and we have dominated the "best" teams but this game could determine whether or not the Warriors reach 73, that's all this is about. But if we lose, maybe it'll be good cause that means the players will choose to rest up for the playoffs.

You guys have been beating us all night and choked it away at the FT line. So no, we should NOT be in this game, but the choking started with your trash FT %

We got #1 seed and home court on LOCK through all the playoffs, and have not lost at home. `\This is the first Jazz game I've watched this season. Please tell me you shoot better than this usually, this is painful.`\he heard you.

edit: oh, maybe not. oops.`\yeah. Fucking Dray had me like (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻`\Does anyone not like the Mario mushroom sound on 3s? I expected it to get old, but still dig it.`\It's funny hearing all the opposing announcers "Our teams defense is awesome, Jazz FG% is low, forcing lots of turnovers..."

Heh. We do this every game.  It's how we play.`\just let curry hit 3's all night and be done with it....`\Curry what the fuck are you doing? The dude's wingspan makes aeroplanes jealous.`\Checking in to see if the 3's record will be broken.

`\Terrible call.`\i know im just trolling`\Good matchup defensively, slower pace, interior game, and a shooter. They have the pieces to compete.`\AUSSIE OOP!`\I still think we'll probably lose this game as the b2b legs start to hit us. And Jazz will probably pick up their play in the 2nd too.`\weak call`\Best clock game in the league.`\A bit of one.`\Even then he exaggerated.`\Dray shoved the hell outta Hood and didn't get the call, come on refs I wanna win this shit but please don't invalidate the other 46 minutes of the game with bullshit calls.`\I feel like Barnes fouled him, not draymond...dray was pretty straight up but Harrison ran into him`\just a yam like one of us
`\Or catch

Such is Jazz basketball`\Holy shit these refs are atrocious`\I'm more worried he'll want more playing time than we can give him.`\Bron's 'Beautiful Mind' can't even deal with that plus/minus chart!`\MoVP`\That's really solid for the dude who's normally your 5th option. Honestly all Barnes needs to do on offence is stand in the corner and nail 3's and occasionally try and find something by cutting to the basket.

I really don't like his post ups or pull up J's. When he puts the ball on the floor bad things start to happen.`\theyll give it to some nerd`\Wow rare miss`\Gobert just got elbowed in the face by Bogut on that free throw. No call.

It does indeed check out.`\Yes.`\This is the usual time for a Warriors 3rd quarter to be starting. That's good, right?`\GSW are fucking punishing teams... like Utah should have won this game, and Warriors are the ones still executing down the stretch. They don't know how to stop, give up, let go. That PnR with Dray should have NEVER been that open, but in OT? In a game this close? Just goes to show you how mentally tough it is to match execution with the Dubs. `\
Having to play Gobert rather than Favors allowed that small ball lineup to do whatever it wanted.  Gobert can't stay in front of ball handlers.  Favors can.`\That was a monster shot by hayward`\I been klay thompson with da shot`\Man, Hayward is not a crunch time go to guy.`\No one expects the Brazilian reception`\we arent even playing that bad.

They choked it away with a trash FT%`\Not really.  Training in high altitude acclimates you to it and strengthens your lungs.

They showed they could step up, and Curry still had a respectable double double. This game was more about his gravity and the team capitalizing. Great job all around.`\true, his defense and hustle on rebounds has been really goody. As soon as he get his jumper back i think HB will be back to full strength`\Hibbert on the floor for the second time in 47 seconds`\Terribly game by dray. Bad decision making all night`\I'm dreading the day I won't get to see Andrew Bogut play for the Warriors.`\lol refs, still making bad calls when the game is over...good job`\Lol and Green can talk all day and nothing...`\That was Draymond`\There was that one YouTube stream where the streamer was super annoying during the breaks. `\Are the Jazz ever going to be good?`\nooooooooooooooo`\Lyles was playing better though.`\Harpring is off on another Chickfila bender. `\thank god for Mack.`\Utah has a ton of bandwagon fans`\TOUCHDOWN!!!!`\I just love this team.

most of the time, i love the guy in the way i love an overexcitable younger brother, but oh my god, sometimes he really kills me.`\yeah, he's my age. Dude looks at least 30`\wow this game is really bad. both teams look dead.`\The only part of that shot that amazes me is the fact that I now expect it to go in. Damn.`\Refs doing everything they can to give this game away.`\look at the second video. He turns it over, then sulks. Shit happens. Lebron gets back much more often on the break than steph. `\Suns bout to run up the score to make this game look less embarrassing. `\Rodney Hood`\***********At home`\lmfao commentators throwin shade at the clips`\kobe fadeaway `\What is life. I need to go hide in a corner`\one of the best quarters we've played in a while.

curious how it all changed when derrick favors came back in the game. im back to thinking hes lowkey our best player.`\pls no :(`\well not over yet i guess`\To try to win every damn game and beat the Bulls record, there def some games we gotta pull out of our asses.`\Cause NBA made the Jazz shit their pants at the line right? And run a pathetic end of game play?`\that's actually the single most repeated jazz related comment`\Please refer to Exhibit D.`\What's going on with this team ?`\Yeah, I'd hardly say it's irrational. Fuck Fisher.`\Klayyyy lmao.`\Warriors have two of the best shooters of all time and a couple other dudes who hit treys.

The Jazz have two guys who I trust on a 15 footer.`\Two plays in a row where the 5 man just watches an easy bucket.`\http://i.imgur.com/LHwysEd.png`\That was a good game. GG both teams. `\Conley would be very cool, but I think it's far too early to count out Exum. He was playing great defense last season and in the little time he had in the preseason he showed a lot of aggression. I think he has potential`\Utah plays hard against the Dubs`\Those were 10 great games by Ish though.  I think Nerlens had a couple or at least came close too.

Best news - Steph only 10% better than Ish in the double double category.  Ish is keeping pace.`\For fuck sake Draymond he was 30 feet out`\THESE FTS`\No terrible play. `\More like thank fucking God `\Why is no one going back to help?? Kerr needs to use his TOs.`\classy jazz fans booing dray...nice`\I would love to see the Jazz make the playoffs this year.  Mostly because I hate the Rockets`\I'm just going to assume this is a sick burn.`\Nice, now we are gonna watch top notch basketball! `\mom get the camera `\That feeling when you order chips from the vending machine and it gets stuck?  That's what Utah looked like when they played great D and then Curry ends up with the open 3.`\Lol`\Huh, warriors cheerleaders in bollywood get up. I like.`\Not watching the game but if I were, on a scale from 1-10 how mad would i be?Feel free to go off the scale.`\If you were the Jazz you'd be stressing about this lead. Even if it were against the lakers`\Good to see Varejao starting to look for his shots now. `\No, we all think that.`\120-60 final score seems possible.`\Scared of a lob here from Hayward.

Is this how the refs have been all night?`\haygod for lebron cuz`\Their entire team does because of the fucking champ status. its bullshit honestly, but it happens in every sport.`\that was terrible`\Please get Mack out of there.`\i know it's so stupid. now all the discourse is about the format not the game. this was an awesome game! I came here to read what people thought!`\I'm so happy that the Shelvin Mack trade has allowed us to use the lethal Burke-Neto backcourt.`\botchrimewave

They won't even notice a difference fam`\AND ONEEEE!!!`\That shit grin he had running through the tunnel, priceless ♥`\We gonna take the NBA back Maccabees style?  `\You're referring to Looney, Ezeli, and Iguodala being out, right?`\Or better yet, if we make our free throws.`\HB is a better defender; Rush gets blown by on defenses and especially against the Jazz that would be bad since HB can switch onto Hayward no problem.
`\Damn, halftime performance had Drake in it:

https://twitter.com/_MarcusD_/status/707789811214495744/video/1`\You can't shoot free throws worth a damn.`\I legit think Steph should win most improved.

Gg Wizbros.`\Warriors just don't have any energy left.`\Wait what`\Livingston was clutch on d`\I would still say 12 pts and 10 assists is pretty great tbh

Edit: It's a good game. He was also +12.`\That's the best one.`\All ball. How was that even whistled? `\Our defense was terrific today, so many transition baskets. Would have won by 30 if not for UTA's terrific offense boards`\damn no love from the refs at all for the jazz`\How does everyone ignore the fact Quin Snyder looks like a serial killer?
edit: apparently no one ignores it and I just don't watch enough Jazz games. But holy shit, I feel like I've seen some true crime documentary about him`\Holy fuck steph.`\His defense was shockingly bad at first, but I think it just took him a while to get used to the way the Warriors switch and funnel players toward him. Now he's passable at that end, and another good playmaker on offense. I wonder what the rotations will look like when Ezeli comes back.  `\11 free throws to 27. Ok buddy. `\this is such a weird game`\frye was mad that he was getting bodied and losing the game to a goddamn ROOK `\*sigh*`\Dallas ain't gonna make it....Houston have a cake schedule last 4-5 games... Jazz or Houston with a firing Beasley, warriors fans?`\Death squad!`\we just dont have enough playmaking on the wings without Hood or Burks. Now we have Neto/Trey/Shelvin attacking and its just not a threat`\I'm more surprised when Livingston misses a turnaround than when Curry misses a 3. It's cash every time `\Did you hear about the Italian chef that died? He pasta way. `\Goddamn!`\Anyone want double OT?`\YASSS`\Fumble or not you can't go for that stepback Mack!`\Fans are about to get a T also.`\i thought Bollywood night was over after Vivek left for Sac`\triple double territory!!`\# A Concise Game Guide for Tonight

trey lyles grew some hair on his balls in the last couple months`\Definite upgrade from JT`\This is amazing on so many levels.

* He made a half court shot
* We all expect him to make that shot
* The defender came out to contest a 2/3 court shot prior to the shot

Ridiculous

Side note: He's changed the timing of 2 for 1s for the Warriors.  Most teams seem to leave 30-35 sec on the clock to try to get the ball back.  The Warriors seem to only need ~27+sec`\yeah i was going to say an overall disappointment but i had not seen all of his games to make such a comment. bit of a shame. `\"Heavenly Hood, you are intimately aware of the struggle we are experiencing -- the pain and despair of Hairgod's injury.

That's such an easy reach call. GTFO
`\Double technical.

"He definitely gets hit in the groin"

Fuck man he's on a roll today lmao`\Missed a bunch early on but since then he hasn't really taken many shots or hasnt had to.

Started 0/5 and is 3/5 since.`\I know we're up 22 but these refs suck`\this happens sometimes at the end of season between teams playing their asses off and teams that have totally checked out and are smoking blunts in the hotel pregame`\I bet it smells like sweat and greatness`\Got it, thanks.`\Thanks buddy`\Hayward walks like he's wearing heels.`\I like the confidence.`\Which is why I hate this boxscore shit.`\Funny we pay about $22 million for those guys to do that.`\GOBERT = STEPH CONFIRMED`\Gordon Haywards hair is the definition of perfection`\Via Jody Gennessy

>Kobe Bryant just ran over to Jazz owner Gail Miller and gave her a hug. Utah fans didn't boo that.`\Turn around J's from 24+ ft?`\Because when this sub went through the phase of those titles, EVERYONE was trying to make them and trying to be the funniest. Then all the comments would be about the title and not the games. Literally what is happening in this thread that people are complaining about. `\I hear a lot of cheers when he scores!`\Phillips, Fitzy, and their families. That's at least 8`\I'd say on average it pays off that he, Iggy and others play like that.  Gets a lot of steals.`\lmaooo`\No matter what your win/loss ratio is, never let anything slide if its rightfully yours`\I can't imagine how terrible Gobert, Mack and Hayward feel after missing those free throws. The game should never have went to OT.

They had a shot to take down a giant and they shot themselves in the foot instead. `\GG Dubs. We done.`\It was over in the second. Those turnovers and missed open shots. `\Hopefully favors is fine `\#any word on faves yet?`\nah they turned into the Chokelahoma City Thunder`\WOW.

San Antonio is still two hours ahead of the Bay Area. Draymond being left off those ballots was inexcusable; any way you slice it. `\Probably vs San Antonio`\ooo kill em lyles`\lol these refs.`\andres bogut, steven curry, karl thompson, drayman green, and the other  guy.

quite a team.`\Neto is neato`\Hood has gone nuclear.`\Yeah... about that..`\cry me a river.....`\Good grind-it-out win by the Warriors. The prospect of having to face them in the playoffs is intimidating, so I hope they get upset in the first round by the Jazz. But not the Rockets.

Not a lot of mental toughness, he misses open shots, he misses more open shots, he forces the ball, it's just been hard to watch since he came back from injury.

`\Wow Russell gnna play only 12 minutes this half. I don't fuckig tune in to watch Marcelo Huertas play.`\Warriors broadcast hasn't even acknowledged he left the 2nd time. Wondering if Utah's dug up anything myself.`\Why do we give book minutes with this stud on the bench`\WTF is taking these refs so long?`\Go fuck yourself`\stop shooting john`\iowa or temple? im having a hard time on this match up. i mean iowa started hot but has really tailed off recently, and to be honest i dont know a whole lot about temple.`\so Russell is not overrated by you guys? lol`\Whaaaaa?!?!?! streamable for that curry drive please.`\trey 4 trey`\Gotta love the Warriors for giving us so much good ball to watch.`\Slo Mo Joe deceptively slow`\Lyles deserves a suspension. `\Fucking rolling, that's hilarious `\Agreed.`\Yep, this is the Mormon version of the island from Lost.  You've been dead all along.

Not much, but by his standards in the slump he's in, it's decent.`\The more correct statement is the Jazz play ugly games `\I bet his wife roots for him too. :)`\2min ball game!`\I'm having the same battle. I thought we'd have our second half collapse by now.`\insane shot iggy`\he's gotta recharge once in a while `\We should make this quote our sidebar photo`\This is the best game of the year for us.  Sorry Cleveland, we need this so much.`\Wow`\Looks like we are gonna see Curry go off now.

I wasn't talking about that title.`\Hood the new mamba?`\Sure the dubs are good, but the amount of 4th quarter chokage I've seen vs them is ridiculous.`\And there is a link included that links to the boxscore right below it. Weird redundancy.`\we have a lot of dudes injured and bogut has 4 fouls, don't really have a choice`\WE GETTING #68 BOYS!!!!`\Just had to make the FTs :/`\We'll see.`\I can't believe we have the 7th seed right now with our starting point missing a full year, burks missing another half year, gobert missing a quarter of the year, and numerous other short injuries.

Credit to Quinn Snyder and Gordon Hayward.`\To be fair, that's how the Jazz did it.`\No`\With his recent play? He'd fall further. The main reason why I want that pick is because it will become dirt cheap with the next two cap jump.`\Every single shot the Warriors made in the 4th so far lie on a straight line.`\Haha right on. I thought the cavs coach picked him`\Grizzlies losin too`\Can't even tell the game went into ot with this title`\Ugly.`\earl watson was on the jazz like 2 or 3 years ago, i always liked him. hopefully with the morri cleared out of phoenix, and devin booker looking like a real player, he can have success.

but not tonight, lets keep building the lead forever and never stop`\DEATHBALL LINEUP TIL THE END, LET'S GO`\"Jazz are Utah"

Yes, the Jazz are, in fact, Utah

Edit: I know they were saying "We are Utah", but the signs went up the wrong way`\Jazz choked hard. `\Seriously, whoever requested that all box scores be posted like this was a huge fuckboi. You can't even see these correctly on mobile, alien blue at least`\Absolutely shitting on a team when Curry is about as off as he can be`\Saw a kid in a Warriors jersey doing the 3 hands celebration after Hayward's 3. `\Great. Jazz suck and Utah is a dry state full of Mormons. What a shitty situation.`\- Mo Buckets showed up

- Steph hit another three pointer from half court

- The Warriors won by 20 again

I say it's another day in the office `\With the left hand...`\He mad`\I really thought GSW should have rested today, but as a fan I'm glad they didn't.`\If you have enough money to afford court side seats, it's probably not a huge deal.

Sloppy fucking passing, horrible close outs on 3PAs, poor boxing out. `\nahhhh`\Utah's so long, Dubs getting owned on the offensive boards`\Let's do this Jazz Nation!`\refs fucking everyone!`\I think he looks like Matthew McConaughey's deadbeat dad.`\The good Warriors bench decided to show up today.`\Snyder just put that ref on his list.`\And so is the Ws'`\Ifyoureallywannagetawaygetawaygetaway`\This is gross, cmon guys`\27-14, good start boys. `\god damn no shot blockers without bogut `\absolutely`\How the Warriors have so much fight on a back to back is beyond belief `\Everything about this girl is confusing, there's bit of a Kiwi accent being thrown in there, and it's so weird.`\Whistle. Whistle. Whistle. Whistle. Whistle. `\somewhere /u/rabsho is smiling`\Good game for Barnes, you can talk 1-8 on threes all you want but he was on the boards, played stifling defense without fouling, and had energy all game.

And because the jazz got about a billion more free throws despite it being physical both ways. `\I remember in game 6 against the Grizzlies almost end of the game/series and Bogut chucked up a 3. It would've been bonkers if he made that. `\God damn. Don't give it to mack in the clutch seriously

Dudes good as fuck and this is only his 2nd or 3rd year. `\sitting in the Tank listening to that will ease my restless ear drums`\but it is still an improvement.`\Hood is all over Korver on defense. `\SHELVIN MACK????!!!! REALLY??`\They dont call him Wild Thing for nothin'`\Holy crap I'm at work and can't watch, how are we winning without Hayward?`\It's really impressive how essential he is to a team that plays so fast and often plays small. Especially considering his age. He's like Iggy in the sense that the numbers don't really show just how valuable they are.`\They might not overtake Houston at this rate. :(`\Hood and Favors, lets do this shit.`\Aww, didn't make it.`\Bootum could shit all over this laker game. So many airballs. So many bad turnovers.`\it's fine when they aren't on the ground hurt`\I'm surprised you're getting downvoted lol.

Yes he's a legit NBA player.  He's a solid rotation guy.  He almost always makes the correct basketball play, he's shooting 37% from 3, he doesn't take dumb shots, he plays solid defense and he's a good passer.  He's also apparently been great in the locker room as a glue guy.

Having said all of that, I would much rather have Burks playing 30 minutes per night, but as we all know injuries suck.`\He and Burks were taking some jump shots before the game against the Lakers on Monday, seems like they both are working their way back on schedule (Burks is late, however).`\There's no reason to be upset.`\Good things happen when Rodney Hood shoots the ball.`\hope jazz win, would rather see them in playoffs than dallas no offense`\A little off topic but is anyone else excited for [3 on 3 freestyle?](https://youtu.be/DGtRNJe-yrE)

Might scratch my itch for NBA Street vol 2`\Its crazy close.  Houston owns the tie breaker on us.  So if it comes down to the Jazz and Rockets tying for the seventh seed.  We will meet in the playoffs in the first round.`\offense is only buckets`\Another day, another team shooting the trey ball welll against the Wizards.`\༼ つ ◕_◕ ༽つSTEPH TAKE MY ENERGY ༼ つ◕_◕ ༽つ`\really feels like the warriors are having a get-right game against one of the best defenses in the league`\I'll miss him but I'm glad we don't have to play him anymore. `\Utah went to the Deandre Jordan school of free throw shooting.`\This is like last time`\Mack is a bad player`\bruh he ducked down and then put a lil something on that elbow.... lyles knew exactly where he was at and what he was doing... `\I think the 4,000+ ft elevation change is real, too. That would absolutely affect an athlete. `\Here comes the illegal screens`\love you jazz. this is for all those Lakers fans acting as if we're such an 'embarrassment to the league' and their team isn't.

Nobody is going to care in 3 years that you won 5 more games than us. They're just going to remember we were both shit.`\Mack only -8, Gobert -20 right now. +\- is weird`\I believe he means at home for us.`\A bit of slur, but I agree `\LMAO "he'd rather not be a clipper" `\Please be okay Favors. :(

what`\Did the Jazz make a sacrifice to Deandre Jordan or something?`\You see, the thing about the Splash Bros. Is that there's 2 of them.`\Throwin elbows at the groin. He's lucky he just got faced up. `\Indigestion?`\Barnes is a better piece to use in a sign and trade for Durant.`\dalls up 2`\lmao lebron clownin'`\This dance cam is just too utah `\It's called having not enough talent and a trash offensive system`\Neto, gobert, and hood`\Pls jazz`\The Cavs blew out the Lakers and Clippers their last 2 games.`\I know Dwight hate is cool here but he was the centerpiece of a finals team and defensive player of the year multiple times for a reason. Deandre is not the smartest situational guy but it take basketball smarts to run the pick n roll the way he does and defend the rim every night without fouling out. I don't watch Gobert as much but that comment is such bullshit. You don't do any of that by just being tall. `\24 TO's bad?`\The sad thing is that as a Jazz fan this feels like one of the more fairly officiated games that I've seen.

Normally refs blatantly try to fuck us over.  Tonight it's just "meh"`\quarterback mo`\THIS WARRIORS TEAM IS GONNA RUIN ME. I'VE BEEN SO SPOILED. HOW AM I GOING TO RECOVER FROM THIS`\Lmao that's so bad`\Go Denver btw`\haha what a dumb foul.`\Sorry man. I do like the Jazz (Trey Burke <3) but I definitely wanna see the Warriors break the Bulls record this year `\I'm still confused.

How is getting in someones face for elbowing you in the dick equivalent to elbowing someone in the dick?

Doesn't matter now, just found it funny.`\ball don't fucking lie`\Can somebody post a stream please`\Varejao has been a bit disappointing of late. `\Thank you, Mack`\LMAO at bob throwing shade at the clippers with "steph would rather not be a clipper and harp on calls" `\And so it is decreed`\I love that Hood was passed over to let us pick him at 23rd.

Kinda pissed me off tbh`\varejao with a wing jumper on back 2 back possessions wtf `\Fuck a scheduling loss, NBA.`\Who needs curry when we got the yam himself. `\FAVORS DAGGER`\Really bad timing lol
One thing to be reactionary and say it after a poor offensive performance, but like you said, we just scored 110 on a good defensive team`\Is this how it's done now? Who gives a flying fuck about the format? `\at least it's easy to find the game thread today`\HOOD IS GOOD. `\ooo Clark needed to get that to Klay`\Fun stress/drama/suspense`\Mack with the board. `\if only you weren't so good in close games lol`\GET THAT SHIT OUTA HERE`\Rabsho's ex`\shooting 50% from the line against the Warriors is probably not a great strategy`\I havent seen Kevin Love go off since nam. Is he really going to do it against us?`\Neto with the Yakkity Sax on that last one lmao `\Hack a Strategy yes..`\4/14 on free throws this quarter. Even if we go 50% then this game would be over`\What did they say?`\Why aren't we team rebounding against Gobert?`\Why does that guy have courtside seats when he doesn't even watch the game? `\I've always said getting to the playoffs is important for a team, but I'm starting to believe the Wizards gotta miss the playoffs. They've been talking a bit too much and have the tendency to play frontrunner, which they admit all the time. Maybe it's time for them to be humbled.`\Not watching the jazz broadcast, is harpring just going ape about chick fil a right now? `\*Sheldon`\Sh3lvin`\nice dray!`\Someone deliver. I want that too. After this season is over, someone really needs to make a video of what I call all the "Fuck You 3's" Curry took this season.`\Only 30 games behind..`\Just realized that Kris Humphries is yet another Ex-Jazz player to join the Hawks.`\Yeah like the last 50 years. You kidding me??`\no shit`\... Harpring explicitly said it wasn't his fault.`\Flair up bitch`\man. what an effort from the Champs... this was a trap game`\Yeah the wizards have been worse than the refs`\Lol dude way to be a prick when your team is the best.

He is one of the best rebounding guards after Westbrook and Harden, right? Are there any guards that continually get double digit rebounds? `\wow refs suck tonight`\:) lol Curry out there being a bully `\Lost in all of this is Gordon Hayward's 1-point performance. However, we know that Gordon will sometimes save his scoring for the 4th. I'm not sure how much he'll play in the 2nd half, though.`\his offensive game is complete`\Jesus Christ that woman's greed just paid off.`\Warriors just teasing everyone`\pls don't hit 70`\We make history wherever we go`\Bogut running back on that three just like the other night. `\Ingles with a good closeout. Hooray! `\thanks refs. Really proving how we're the most disadvantaged team in the league there.`\Get your whining ready, Utah's a good team`\because their fanbase is avg age of 14 and its very easy to rile them up.`\If Hayward's getting T'd you know shit is bad.`\Upvoted but then read the second sentence lol`\damn dude. what the hell did you eat mo??? what the fuck?`\I told you Big Joe was a lockdown defender.`\Well Happy Birthday Byron, bitch ass.`\Thanks Hayward`\hahaha classic`\sky fucker supreme `\i like mo because he's fat.

Obviously it's probably not usually this bad but how are you guys FT wise normally?`\Our MVP was Steph, but huge props to Livingston for the defense and rebounding, particularly the board that got the ball back to Klay for the game-tying three`\no, neither is tossing a punch. hes gone, im right on these things`\> Plus it's like the thrill of running your own TV station for the evening.

Kid pissed me off but I do like that aspect of it. It's a neat period in broadcasting history where some kid, just by virtue of having league pass or whatever, can reach thousands of viewers because he was the one to put in the work to stream the game. Viewers get the game, he gets an audience, and I think that's neat (regardless of what dumb shit he does with having an audience haha). `\Must win game tonight.`\He is so fucking awful. `\Does Barnes not have the same explosiveness since his injury? When's the last time he's dunked?`\Huh. The Dubs look dead out there.`\That was a good block`\You can always count on Barnes making the weakest fouls`\Lakers are my favorite southern California basketball team`\Why has this commercial break been going on for the past 10 minutes?  I thought Quin just took a timeout near the end of the 1st quarter but they are treating it like halftime.

Not bad.`\Every time Curry drives there's a foul, how can you defend him?`\What did they to do them?!`\bullshit call, but there'd be an entire thread if Lebron stomped his feet like that.`\gg Warrior bros, hope to see you in the first round matchup`\We don't deserve to win this game but fuck the Warriors and fuck the refs. `\lmao fucking ridiculous refs, that's a moving screen? on a fucking hand off!?`\Just wish people would stay loyal to a team, that's all. Players get shit on for chasing rings but fans are given a free pass? lol okay.`\So you're saying we gonna win?`\*Heavy breathing*`\I love that the Arena DJ still plays coco every home game.

Kind of funny that a song about loving cocaine is our unofficial song.`\Dat half court shot tho`\More stupid fouls`\Post Game part 3`\Great warrior team effort on consecutive TOs`\mo speights with MO BLOCKS`\Kobe is playin tight on Hood. `\TREY LYLES WAS WORTH THE 12TH PICK`\1. Hits over 90% of FTs.
2. Hits 2-pointers at over 50% accuracy.
3. Hits 3s at 46%.
4. Hits step-back threes over tight defense regularly.
5. Has been hitting half court shots (and beyond) in a matter of a few seconds.

What's next... a post-up game?
`\Drink whenever Wizards miss a free-throw, by the end you're too drunk to worry about a loss, perfect plan or what?`\Hood has been so cold lately`\Suggs looks like an orc `\So amazing`\No worries bro,  cyu next game `\hood needs to look for his shot more`\Don't worry Hawks. we've had double digit leads in the first half a of our last eight. And we're 2-6 in those games.`\But u/Rabsho said we have no chance to beat you...`\Yes.  Please please please don't choke on these Free throws`\WHY WOULD YOU PASS THAT HAYWARD`\"Sir we weren't trying to trespass, just trying to find our way home and did not know this was private property"`\I agree that he has looked good and healthy recently.  For a guy that has such a reputation for fragility, he seems pretty agile and active.`\I don't recall any game threads that have been worded that way, but fuck the mods I guess. `\alright i ***would*** like to hang the phattest loss on the lakers. we need 50`\Blatant missed call there. Sorry Utah :(`\Utah is DONE`\8 points is a tiny lead, esp by Dubs standards.

Just resting Klay for the big push, hopefully`\You know it's a bad crew when both sides are super unsatisfied. `\Oh Delly the Curry Stopper?

Noone with the impact of exum, burks, or especially favors.`\This is why the eye test is so important in measuring the quality of a defender. There are so many other factors at play and so few stats that work in a vacuum, you've just gotta watch the guy.

Curry is easily an above average defender. I've been watching him all year, and he's scrappy, smart, quick, and a general pain in the ass.`\A little tic tac toe`\And Steph has checked in.`\And he sets nasty screens`\yah but this is essentially a meaningless game as it won't hurt the home streak and the jazz are super physical.  Let andy eat up minutes and don't let the obvious wear and tear on our dudes go further`\Curry is outta the 50/40/90 club with that missed FT`\Curry is now one of those pussies that hacks guys all day and cant believe he ever fouls. `\NBA refs, mad cause I'm flagrant,

People forget that Steph under Jackson used to play 38 mpg or 37 mpg. He is under 34 mpg now. So his minutes over the last few seasons are down quite a bit. He sits out the first 6 minutes in both the 2nd and 4th quarters but thanks to some blowouts he has been able to rest quite a bit.

I like Hayward a lot.`\probably cause Gobert was beast.. `\FUCK YOU KNICKS YOU FAILURES`\damn I feel like I havent seen one of these quick runs from us in a while

probably cuz ive missed the last two games but even then`\that's not even close to the same thing.  When one guy gets the steal and is already at full speed.  At least Curry tries to run back and then realizes it's too late.  Lebron just walks off in the opposite direction like he doesn't give a shit.

But yeah, you're right, they were similar games.  I'm done here arguing with a madman.`\Does Draymon Green always get away with this much shit?`\It's over GG Warriors`\Couple more rounds of D.`\COCO`\Or they just...

Did you see the no calls on Klay and Curry?`\Can't wait for Jazz vs Warriors first round, might be an actual series. Each time they've played(3 times I think) they've all been pretty close.

The reason why we stink now is that Quin doesn't know how to use him and it screwed up our rotations.`\It's alright to be a little gay, dude.  No need to feel weird about it.`\Not only are they one of the best teams ever, but they ALWAYS give us a hell of a show. Every single damn game - and the opponents help, by showing up.

As a Dubs fan, I honestly am indifferent to who we face and when we face them in the playoffs, as I think any true championship team should be able to defeat any team in a series they have to play. I can see how an early GS/Utah matchup may be like last year's Dubs/NO series, and go to 7 games or something. `\Fan beside me just booed when they showed a picture of the refs pre game.

At the very least call the obvious ones.`\Thing is, the team is more than capable of creating plays without Curry scoring all the time, that's kinda what the team was all about, depth.  But they need touches to get into rhythm, same with any other team honestly.  In the long run, it's more efficient to play like that.`\Jazz fans, do you guys want to see your team go after teague or conley?`\Kerr says how Steph is absolutely carrying this team, and they respond with him being the 5th leading scorer in a 20 point blowout win!

There may have been a few comments about the title if it was funny or interesting, but I don't see that at as a bad thing. At the end of the day the people who wanted to discuss the game would be able to and would do so regardless of the title. `\LeBron playing some lazy defense here`\Millsap with the cicus shot`\Barnes, c'mon...`\It all comes down to free-throws.

Not worth the gamble though.`\mo speights just said that his long pass was supposed to go to iguodala, but barbosa intercepted it.

this is the most mo speights thing that he could have possibly said. `\Gives Hayward more space`\Frye em up!`\A foul occurred. But refs are checking if it was before/after the clock expired`\I'm with you on last year, mostly because of the number of games Kawhi missed.  This year, I'm not so sure because they're both amazing.

And to be fair Kawhi isn't on the east coast either so he has some trouble with that too.  That whole east coast voters going to sleep early thing bothered me way more about McCaffrey.  `\warrios dont take a lot of free throws because they're a jump shooting team `\We went a minute without turning the balll over.

WTF.`\LYL3S to close out the half!`\Wizards just let Kieff get caught up in the double team.`\I LOVE YOUR TEAM THOUGH SUCH YOUNG TALENT.

GOD IF YALL STAY TOGETHER YALL WILL BE SPOOPY IN THE FUTURE`\Give it a rest buddy. Your trolling attempts are mediocre.`\They started off so well but lost it big time in the second half`\If Wall plays bad defense, there's no argument that he's better than Lillard or Lowry `\clear path?`\mr. robot`\Heh true`\Mo Speights had the lowest shooting percentage of all the bench players that scored tonight at 60% (6-10)`\Yes and No. Jazz are great - they have a lot of ways they can beat us, but I think this game really exposed them and if we faced them we'd continue to drive the point home.

They are *big* inside, and I think Favors might be able to consistently beat Dray. Gordon and Favors two man ball is awesome, and with Gordon and Hood splashing the amount of threes they are, they can score and keep up with the Warriors while slowing the game down. They also were out rebounding us tonight and that has shown to be a big advantage and a great way to keep the game close. See the OKC game.

However, Hayward CANNOT DRIVE LEFT. And Warriors exposed that tonight. He turned it over multiple times, was not able to create space, and that's just such an achilles heel that the Warriors exploited in OT. Apparently, they can't shoot free throws. But I guess this was just a fluke? Also Klay and Dray both matched up on Gobert and he didn't do shit about it. That's the kind of thing that will lead to a fucking starting lineup change if it comes down to it. Gobert may be able to capitalize eventually but as it stands he is not a threat on offense. `\Fucking ayyyyyylmao. Sky fucker does it again.`\I saw Curry look at the scoreboard at 41-46 and think to himself "we are making this an 11 point game"`\They havemt seen us go like 1/18 in a 9 min stretch, but we have`\Lol honestly what's your ideal realistic pg situation this off season?

Ok, first of all things about this game: I was feeling physically ill during the first half of the fourth quarter. I think this was due to my anxiety regarding taking a loss. This level of emotional investment is too much. Also I should eat some food.

The Warriors were just getting trashed by the Jazz, all game. Even when they made small runs or went up it just looked so bad. But the Jazz... Unbelievable amount of missed free throws.

The Refs were shitty.

Also, that was one of the clutchest games from the Warriors that I've seen in a long time. That huge run to tie it at the end of the fourth and then extend in OT was ridiculously clutch. Way more impressive than a single-shot winner.

That matchup is just meant to be brutal.`\10 points in the 4th for Lyles`\Give Hood the ball!`\It's the clock management at the end of quarters. They ALWAYS get 2 for 1. End of the half they called timeout, came out got a three, then got the stop and the heave. `\You have to be kidding..`\What an incredible pass by Mo Buckets! `\Wtf are we doing.....book and cj in at one time?

I just got in trouble for saying this.`\Shhh`\So Jazz fans, how untouchable is Gobert?  Is he like LBJ, Kyrie, and Love for Gobert untouchable or like Teague + 1st rounder untouchable?`\to be fair he isn't usually this bad.

It's the rebounding that has been poor. 8 offensive boards is the reason this is a close game.`\Is Hibbert still semi-good or nah?`\>"Nothing but Net"

-Bolerjack`\It also usually comes in a spurt where we haven't made a fg in 2+ minutes.`\Nice, Ian's coming in. Hope he gets a few buckets.`\https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_BBKI3zcTQ

Watch the second clip in that video, Steph gets beat and then jogs while Russell gets the easy fastbreak layup. I did watch the game. I watch every portland game.

Edit: Or go to 53 seconds in here https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRny0PTCZsU`\negative`\Oh fuck off refs`\Surely that was one of the worst FT shooting performances of any team the whole season, no? That was atrocious.`\maybe they left it on because the boxscore was taking too long? i know it was doing that for a few games couple days ago.`\This is ridiculous, how do you miss the fact that a ball hits a person?`\>Still all speculation for now, but no injury report today plus Burks changing his recent pregame routine is certainly a bit interesting.

No doubt.`\Oh Mo :(`\Lakers must really want Jazz to make to playoff and push Rocket off.

Love Dray, but I was just yelling at him like "WTF were you thinking?!"`\fml`\I just started watching, which means there's a good chance we'll lose our lead.`\AH SHUT THIS THE FUCK DOWN. WE DONE FOLKS`\To be fair, I can't name another player who played for the Cavs prior to Lebron and Love coming so it would make sense that the only player they have worth a damn takes the bulk of their shots in the fourth.`\God I hope we get the 8 seed`\If they made layups worth 3 then Dwight Howard would be MVP, unless they made free throws worth 2...`\It's a good thing our terrible guard situation is solved with our two major injuries in Burks and Exum.`\A non-robot doesn't make that shot`\Holy shit touchdown. `\you can't think that way. if he didn't get that tech, maybe mack doesn't get the 3pt call on the next play.`\Just catch and shoot! The moment he hesitates, the accuracy goes down.`\Hood please stop the crowds face is melting.`\The Jazz are about to shoot a lot FT tomorrow. `\Proof all warriors fans are bandwagoners `\OT :) Let's gooooo`\That's a rough schedule. `\in Yam we trust `\I'm still pissed at that bogus blocking call. `\The point is that the mods have to draw a line between what is acceptable as a title and what is not. If they do not draw that line, titles will become absurd. It is better this way.`\HB pulled an MJ`\Cmon man, don't take one incident in isolation and use it to taint the entire player lol. You see a couple "lowlights" of Dray and think he plays like that 24/7, it's just disingenuous. `\and Memphis. Dallas plays Cleveland, Portland twice, and Warriors twice in the next five. We still got time.`\Ooh, that ball movement was a thing of beauty.`\Why? `\Holy fuck this is a fun game to watch!`\Dear Jazz, please shoot it and hit the rim before 24 seconds have expired. Thank you.`\Warriors starting to lose their composure. `\We need Iggy fuck`\JRs lobs to LeBron are so sloppy and LeBron still throws em down`\Mo letting Ian Clark battle gobert for that rebound...sigh`\Go lose your money then. If Kerr doesn't rest your guys against the Iowa Energy then he isn't doing your team any favors. Have you seen the roster we have? I think maybe 3-4 guys playing that actually started the year as Grizzlies. The rest are mostly 10 day contracts.`\Yeah, I think Teague didn't move because Atlanta was asking tons for him from everybody.`\He need some milk`\Amazing to see how dominate Rudy Gobert can be. Canada sure as hell doesn't televise enough Utah Jazz games for me to see him often..`\Warriors used the same play they used to beat the Pels in the playoffs last year.

Miss a 3 (on purpose, to use more time), get the rebound, kick it to the same guy who just missed, swish.`\Oh god don't do this... Don't start to make a comeback then just shit it away..

 oh yes!`\Just came back from DC and turned the game on and Buck is talking about 5 seconds `\Favors, exum, burks.

Favors is much much much better than iggy or ezeli combined.`\so tired of political ads.`\This is looking like a pre allstar game for the warriors!`\Like a Brazilian ballerina `\that 3 never should have happened man`\For those wondering. This half-time show is north indian (punjabi) dance called bhangra.`\I'm so happy that basically every post (at this point) is about Big Yam's performance.`\Tigers fan here, it always hurts.`\you're not wrong`\Curry gives up a wide open 3 and then he instantly sags off in the same way. You either have to commit to a double team and actually apply pressure or stay home on your man. None of this just standing in the middle playing no D. Andre did this in the first half once.`\AK NEEDS TO COME TO MORE JAZZ GAMES`\Good hard foul after giving up all those And-1's yesterday. Can't go soft on em if you're gonna foul`\that was a legit foul on curry, can't hug the screener no matter how lovable he is`\Way too early.`\klayyyyyyyyy`\That's the one result you don't want? You would rather lose in regulation than win in OT?`\No thanks to Bum ass Barnes.  Guy is holding the Warriors back.  `\Where the varejao haters at?`\Watching Jazz fans try to nae nae is about the most cringeworthy shit I've seen all week.`\The ref looking at there backs has to trust his crew there, the official in front of the play held rightly held his whistle.`\Now a Hayward airball.

And that was a clean block, imo. The body contact seemed minimal. `\thats how u foul HB`\hayward is NOT out top free throw shooter mr lakers

rodney hood shoots a pure 87%`\haha yeah, that's pretty much how it feels...`\These fucking refs are complete garbage`\Is that Gobert's first made shot from outside the paint? I'm being dead serious it honestly might be!`\worst fanbase honestly. all of them dont suck but those that do drag it all down

Still, lots of love all night for the Laker announcers. Man I'd kill to have them doing Jazz games all the time.  `\Dead.`\The boys look exhausted out there`\How far out was it?

I wasn't exactly sure what the Jazz were doing for him.`\Didn't feel like a game against the Warriors until he hit that`\just a sLOB like one of us?`\Jazz bear is my favorite mascot`\Why is Clark still in if you aren't going to play Barbosa with the first team??`\Utah: We supposedly have a good coach, and they have no big men, but let's just take a contested jumper every goddamn possession`\Yeah who loses close games to the best team of all time?`\Utah deserves to lose after letting Shelvin Mack, Neto and Lyles run the offense. How about letting Hayward shoot rather than stand in the corner? Wtf?`\God fucking damn it it feels like the Jazz can't get a single look out there. It's either Gobert or Ingalls or someone in the paint or nothing damn near. This is so frustrating.`\"lol step back lmao" - Steph `\Clear charge`\Anyone else think AK should get his number retired? His number is so iconic and he's top 5 in so many categories for the franchise`\Here comes the screens.`\stream?

You can have a double double without it being a great game. John Wall does it frequently. `\he was gonna keep it because Curry's man came to screen, so Hayward could take it against Curry. but Curry and Dray switched their assignments right before so that Hayward couldn't really take advantage of the screen`\Should have added "make it optional" option.`\I blame Joseph Smith, dumb dee dumb dumb dumb. `\Thornton make a shot so we can like you please`\european`\Well that was fun while it lasted. Hard luck Jazz`\For real, shit gets frustrating. He does a good job of staying calm though.`\Otto's shooting has fallen off a cliff yikes.`\You're not just an embarrassment to the league, you're an embarrassment to professional sports `\time for flopjao`\Denver needs to sign Mo Buckets at QB`\It's a weird situation...

I don't think he was good enough to deserve it... but at the same time I would be upset if someone wore 47 for the Jazz again.

`\gross.`\hes softer than tissue paper`\Hayward plays very similarly to DeRozan`\y was no one boxing out anyone..`\Man comeback win when it looked like there was no hope and now the stream is playing new star wars before it comes out? Great night`\Lol. Look at your comment history. You've said it like 7 times. Glad that's all you know about the Cavs `\Worse than Harden`\it is tradition `\AK!!!`\WHAT THE FUCK IS THIS STUPID FUCKING TEAM DOING`\steph "mo speights" curry`\Not when he's anchoring this team's perimeter D`\They're starting Joe Ingles right now have some sympathy`\Are you fucking blind?`\didn't he lose weight this offseason for that purpose?`\So, um, hi. This is awkward seeing as how I wanted you to end up on the worst team in the league for a pick a couple weeks ago. But we chill now fam, i should have never doubted killa T. Just don't go back to being what you used to be k? k ��`\Warriors look extremely vulnerable, and I don't understand why they keep on playing Varejao. He looks consistently horrible.`\Mo Speights is the best QB in the NBA. NINERS SIGN HIM!`\I embrace the team, I'm awestruck every time I watch them play. Doesn't mean I'm gonna become a fan.`\Perfect end to a perfect 3 quarters.`\tristan thompson no contest`\Warriors need to just have Bogut/Varejao/Ezeli (eventually) in the paint as Steph chucks threes from half court.`\Mack attack going full choke mode preciate that fam`\Went back and watched it again, looks clean from our angle but he might have got arm.`\You're being selfish.`\MO = CURRY????`\I read that as Speights Yam`\There are foul issues to consider man.

If the refs hadn't done both teams dirty all night, it'd be completely different. `\And he's a rookie `\Shawn and Steph can play together but shawns pretty big`\But our lord /u/RGiss is gone. He is at the game. For shame.`\Curry needs to control this game now`\Gobert might not get a dunk Tonight`\u/Rabsho said a lot of things`\Reckless. Shots aren't falling and he keeps taking them. Lots of turnovers. Bad defense. Just pretty miserable.`\lol...so true.`\BOOKER BLOCK`\Any time a Warriors fan questions Kerr's sub patterns, I question how often they actually watch them play.

For example: why isn't Curry in to begin the 4th?`\"Stick to (couldn't hear what he said)...stop taking threes, you're trash" etc`\The cavs are launching as many 3s as they can during games to prep for the warriors in the championship. Wins be damned `\this delay is so long i think gordon's foot is better now`\Sounds like I did. You're trying to say that if you attend an out of town game you are a bandwagon fan which is the stupidest thing to say. `\Yeahhh get those defensive stops you dirty Warriors `\Mavs losing after 1.`\favors sexy crossover`\Jesus, how many games have there been where the opposing team can't finish off the Warriors in the 4th quarter? Feels like there's been at least 10 of those.`\well if livingston can do it then anything is possible and bogut might just morph into a shooter sometime soon`\Guess what? Looks like Warriors are gonna score under 92 points!`\ugh, I wanna watch the rest of the game but I have to get up early tomorrow`\sloppy quarter, too many turnovers and missing wide open shots `\Can we convince Larry Sanders to love basketball again and stop smoking weed so he can play for us?`\Putting contact back in from floor DansGame`\Warriors chant in Utah!?`\Not sensing a lot of energy from Rudy tonight...`\the goddamn mavericks came back on the goddamn knicks again`\It really doesn't seem that far`\Rodney: 30

Lakers: 33

good game going`\Curry says fuck you`\Not sure if I'd call it wrapped up`\Right on JB, I had the same reaction. Why would you pick your contact up off the floor and put it back in your eye?`\How the fuck did I miss this game? Everyone talkin bout it now`\thats a lot of Ezeli!`\Well you guys tried super hard in the first quarter, good try Utah. Going to bed now. `\Thanks Mo`\Holy shit we suck at free throws tonight.`\Free throws....`\If you're going to complain about a guy getting the rub from the refs, maybe don't pick the most unfavoured in the league.`\He's your casual friendly neighborhood Aussie, what'd he ever do to you?`\Good thing they are still all super young and Get Burks and Exum back. Overall this season was a complete injury filled season`\9!!!`\You have got to be kidding Draymond`\tired as fuck, jazz playing super physical`\Everyone's missing free throws today`\Did Bogut foul out?`\I like him. He was hard to listen to when he started but he's grown on me.`\Who is Hubie`\It's not like the Lakers can afford a producer to fact check, poor small market teams...`\Ranger Rodney. `\Some players are totally in sync, and then there are two players like Mozgov and James who couldn't be any further apart in chemistry. `\Someone's going to give him $80 million. Could be you.`\fucking of course my stream goes down at the last second `\Varejao!`\DUDE STOP FUCKING POSTING THIS GODDAMN`\Lebron also sulked and gave up on the game which was completely over before the end of the first quarter.  I'm sorry, but did you even watch the game?`\We should probably shut Favors down for the rest of the night. I wanna win, but I'd rather keep him healthy.`\To ne`\holy shit... what a game`\I disagree - you play defence and force them into a tough shot. If they make it, then you can't do anything about it. Think of the backlash if they foul then miss the game winner. The warriors are clutch but not stupid.`\Damn sick of listening to Fitz`\Marreese, Mo, Mole, Speights.`\Ok Jazz now just score more than 11 points in the 4th`\They're already fucked. Forget present tense. Let's just say choked. `\Dronkey `\The standing Movation has returned. Love it.`\Weird, the refs are actually favoring us tonight.

Of course it finally happens in a game that's virtually unwinnable.`\Iowa can do it if they catch fire and build some momentum and never really let Temple in to it. Temple's ability to slow the game down on both sides of the ball can take away a lot of that momentum though. Temple by 6?`\Sundiata Gaines to hit the game winner`\Gobert feeding teletovich the ball`\Are you aware that we are currently the 7 seed and beating the warriors at the moment?`\Aware :/ Lost a year of development for Exum too. And when he got hurt, all of the good PG free agents were spoken for.`\SHOOT OUT`\How do the refs not call that push off by Hayward, my goodness.......`\It's like they're scared of Draymond but think Hayward is soft or something. Fuck that, go kill em Hayward`\Somebody has to like us :/`\...Hair`\I do not wish to see Utah in the first round `\Mo just overshadows people. That's how it is...`\s3sh`\WOOOO`\GS are the best at pulling wins out of their ass

But Utah still has a chance`\NONONONONONONONONONONO`\THAT MJ/KOBE BASELINE FADE`\These refs are horse shit. Just give them 73 wins already. Holy fuck.`\HASTHAG MAX CLARK OUT `\Mack fucked up the rotation because Quin thinks he's better than he is. We're 1-5, going to be 1-6 with him in uniform. Awful trade by the FO because of awful coaching.`\Brazilian Side show Bob `\Neto is such a qt. He's totally not 6'4" though ahaha. I don't think he's anywhere close.

Really good defender.`\Mo Speights is the honorary Subway sub of the game`\remember when we started Chris Johnson against the warriors?`\Yesssss`\What do you mean if? Lebron throws a tantrum on every call that goes against him.`\Does Exum still play??`\I mean, we ok.`\He basically can only miss one more FT the entire season.`\Getting popcorn.`\You're welcome, Mavs.`\That foul tho smacked dray in the face hard`\The curse of Kevin Hart `\Budenhozer. What kind of name is that?
`\this made my season`\Tired + good Jazz defense. `\That call is gonna help the Warriors. Curry is pissed now lol.`\Loving the energy, now for the 2nd quarter collapse. Also those Hawks jerseys are sexy.`\we should trade him`\HB!!!!`\Can we sit Barnes or Livingston for Barbosa or would that make us too small? Really need the offensive spark of Barbosa`\XD. Youre funny dude. `\MACK WHAT DID YOU JUST DO`\dammit Utah

you had one job

#ONE JOB`\Bad defender, streaky shooter, takes bad shots.`\/r/nba should *not* strive to emulate /r/nfl's "delete literally everything but news tweets" moderating philosophy.`\disagree. He missed wide open looks, did was not able to take advantage offensively, and kept us out of the game for a long time in the process. He has had every chance to prove he's the guy and he just isn't. `\Looks like we still need a year or two to man up a bit.`\Held Bogut's arm so common foul? Unless they go by the book.`\How much were tix?`\kobes last playing time in utah

Our offense is miserably bad.`\Bogut's an idiot...4 fouls already...has to come out...game`\Such a clean block...  `\Yeah it was. Apparently the ref calling the fourth foul he's committed on the play is not the right thing to do. `\he has a decent BBIQ but he just doesnt have the coordination to always pull it off. he does some stoogy stuff man`\I say the samething to the rich people at levis stadium.`\http://blog.sfgate.com/49ers/wp-content/blogs.dir/2277/files/gs-warriors-at-the-49ers-game/packers-49ers-football-jpeg-07405.jpg`\You're only hearing me.`\Agreed fuck'em`\Daaaaaang.gif`\Only 19 assists for the Warriors.

Hayward 3-10
Hood 3-12
Mack 1-10
Ingles 1-5
Neto 2-6
Chris Johnson 1-2

Overall: 11-45 for 24%
`\I was just thinking this! So nice watching them take shots and assume they'll be misses. `\Utah didn't either apparently `\spurs are playing out of their mind too. or maybe they're robots. who knows. `\lmao fuck off refs`\yep similar eyes `\I`\doh`\BOOOOOOOOM`\Return of The Mack`\How badly would Curry need to play to put his 50-40-90 season at risk? I really, really want to see him get 50-40-90`\fuck Ian Clark`\So is Mo the Warriors version of Ostertag? `\wtf is Ingles still doing in this ball game`\That mascot putting in work`\Can we get triple digits in three quarters?`\Mack going off in that first game with the jazz was the worst thing to happen to us this year outside of injury tsunami`\good shit leandro`\Damnit meant dray`\dat touch pass by sacre.

smh when randle couldn't finish. good thing sacre was there to clean that shit up`\Lol. Hayward doesn't get hot very often. Even if open.`\I think Shelvin Mack is worse`\bad everything hes getting fucking humiliated but somehow stays on the court`\its not like its not widely known and reported about, but i still think its fucking absurd we are playing a team with single digits losses with single digit games left to play`\Why are you reaching Varejao?`\i love mo speights. i'm so sorry for everything i said at the beginning of the season.`\Im sure some but they live and practice there most of the uear`\BDD!`\Your album is missing the new Asian cheerleader

http://i.imgur.com/dEt2A3P.jpg`\Curry is fucking ridiculous. If he did that at the beginning of the year, that would be top of /r/nba. Now it's just like, oh, he did something crazy again.`\"Here's a guy who's been missing"

lmao `\we lose. It's over. Take our playoff spot mavs.`\I like the double travel move by Lyles. Unguardable.`\That was a bad call `\Calm the fuck down warriors. Jesus `\Haha mo don't get too silly here you ain't steph`\Must be something to do with playoff preparation.  I think Kerr likes to play starters a lot of minutes around now to get them ready for playoff minutes, and then give some rest just as the playoffs approach.

Or it could just be trying to help him stay in rhythm...`\The team that won had the player with the higher +/-, crazy`\Booker....3????`\No more Shadow Realm? Damn.`\there was a super old couple making out.  Like really going at it full on tongue.`\Refs were absolute shit that quarter lmao, doesn't help that we were shit as well.`\I don't even remember the last time I've cheered for the Warriors.`\WHEW!~ GG Jazz Bros`\These reviews. Just make the goddamn call already!`\I don't! I looked and can't find anything.`\Moruption!`\A locked in Kobe on defense is still absolutely fucking terrifying.`\Come on Warriors `\Haha! That would be so dope.`\Everyone is gettin blocks, welcome back to Swat Lake City`\Seriously sometimes he gives no effort and just looks bad. Like during this stretch in the 2nd right now. `\Get up, Shelvin.`\shit, not a great start for marcus lol`\expect  a gofundme page for kevin loves contract if he doesn't make a three this game.

`\Can you bring treats to the next practice?`\Damn stream is falling behind!`\Mack has a double double now he needs 3 more rebounds`\Is this Kobes worst +/- of his career? What a way to say goodbye`\Haha we are going to get blown out by the jazz`\Curry has been choking it hard these last few minutes`\Trade this Curry scrub`\Chill Mack our slow pace was killing them `\HEHE streams for Utah Jazz home games is a gold mine /r/whitepeoplegifs `\As great as the Curry passes have been, this last play was by far the most satisfying to see.  Multiple passes, movement without the ball, simple direct passes, nothing fancy....got your SG wide open to nail it.  Thats what we've been lacking since the all star break.`\It was also against the Jazz I believe.`\Went to OT`\lmao at how many people are so upset at this perfectly logical comment. fucking children on this sub man, holy shit...`\>only`\r u there fam? `\YOU GET A T

AND YOU GET A T

#EVERYBODY GETS A T`\GET YAMMED`\I'll say it.

This is getting feisty.`\We're as surprised as you`\***THE NEW YORK KNICKS ARE BACK ON TOP OF THE DALLAS HAGRIDS***`\We don't deserve it, make us work for it.`\I mean technically they're only allowed ten seconds.`\I mean. You're not lying. `\Ayyyyeee Klay LFMAOOOO`\suspect call`\compound interest, maaaaaate!

Don't have to call me accountant and ask 'where the fuck is this champ?'

– Boges!`\Haha hahaha .... I love you Mo`\I'm not saying my sherm induced psychosis is a clean play....  wait, is that what we're referring to?`\ahahahhahahaahah dat huertas pass to nobody`\Yeah, after seeing the replay, it was pretty bad.  Dumb reaction from Frye though, but I understand why now.`\this is our best game in a while`\As a someone who isn't a Warriors' fan Mo is my second favorite Warrior. `\Who is that?`\Welp, those "headbutts" and the double ejection will be the big highlight on everything tomorrow.`\It's a fact if a player ever slips, its a foul.`\i might need rehab for warrior-fans anonymous after this stretch ends. `\Yeah, he loves Len. `\When Kobe plays, Russell becomes invisible. That's why I can't wait for Kobe to retire after this season.`\I sure hope not. Jazz have a habit of blowing leads.`\Our first offensive drought is right on schedule.`\bro can you fucking call a foul`\He plays like Brandon Roy.`\hubbie brown shut the fuck up it's clear who you're rooting for`\tbh i havent seen anyone on the lakers run any plays so far. `\knicks down one with ball :49 left`\I can't watch the game tonight. How are we winning by 20?`\Alright how about anyone but Varejao shoots the ball`\im wetto for neto`\Whatever, I'm not going to fucking baby you when you choose to disregard the facts. I'm not being a prick, I'm being honest. If you have a problem with it, that's on you. `\mo killin it tonight.`\>HOOD AND HOOD ARE THE HOOD

i agree`\I mean, it's early in the game and we've held the lead for most of the time anyway. He's always going to look for the open man or move the ball around before he just pulls the trigger himself in a situation like that.

In a "late game" or clutch scenario where we need to come up with a big momentum swing, he knows he's got the go ahead to always pull up. `\If this new design is so important to the mods, then why not let the person who made the first post game thread change it? Deleting a post game thread after it has more than 300 comments is just dumb.. and the title isn't even right.`\Getting sloppy again. Let's focus on getting stops and let our offense come from that.`\I'm sure you will manage on your own after this game.`\Gobertstien!`\Hood, time for redemption `\This is such a frustrating game to watch.`\I know its early but the Utahs defense looks shitty right now `\Random shower thought: would a 19 year old C who is 7'7" with and who averages 5 points and 15 rebounds and 2 years of basketball experience be drafted 1st overall?`\Why'd they sub Gobert out? He probably would've boxed out there.`\well they still play them one more time, I think if they win that game they'd have the tiebreaker. Plus Mavs are looking a little shaky recently, Jazz are getting Burks back soon, they are rising.`\he's been pretty bad the past few games but yea, he's a maestro`\Man,Jazz are missing some easy shots.`\Barnes`\downloading this twitch emote app was a great decision `\[Searching for post game threads isn't hard](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/search/?q=%5Bpost%20game%20thread%5D&restrict_sr=on&sort=new&t=all)`\I'm so happy Rodney hood is our team`\He'll make all 3`\I bet Curry gets fouled on a 3 with an and1 situation.`\excellent. `\Draymond, what if I told you you don't have to shoot.`\Bogut yam!`\hes played 9 years in the NBA`\german as fuck man, budenholzer`\Free throws are gonna cost us the game is this real life
`\God I dunno whats sexier, Ros or that shot`\Take my mana Favs!`\if you told me that we'd beat the cavs on our 3 point shooting any other time this season I'd say you were a liar. But here we are, and it is amazing. Not over yet though.`\His stat line reads better than his game looked.  I think his misses were amplified because they came at important momentum moments.  I really hope he gets if figured out before the playoffs start.`\i like how he ran out to back coz he got no time to be interviewed`\We're done here Harrison `\helping off hayward ain't smart`\Hayward slammajammin now!`\Utah fucks up`\Ugh`\I sure hope so because he's played like wet tissue paper.`\Hood and Hayward? Favors? Jingles?`\#it #automatically #drops #it`\Only other time they had less than 20 assists this year was in the loss to Detroit, when they had 18.

GG`\He can start in Bogut's absence, for one thing, and WAS starting/playing with the starters against athletic bigs like Thompson and Cousins. Plus his lobs are superior to anyone else on the team. This year he also started to get a lot more blocks, his timing was good. Still a few too many turnovers but he more than made up for that by finding ways to get putbacks, dunks and finishing lobs. `\pls do what the clippers couldn't jazz`\His boy Harrison is killing the Dubs  right now though,  with his awful chucking of the ball`\But can you make a bot to rank the Spurs #1 every week? `\Ya if we was making more shots we'd be winning. `\took hayward down by the neck in a fucking preseason game.`\Just turned the game on...Cavs seriously imploding.

I created the original tool - which I use to post most of the Hornets threads - back over a year ago. Because a lot of people were asking how I created them, I made a post sharing/explaining the Excel file (over a month ago?).

I have no idea where that [Meta] thread from a few days ago came from. Once a saw it became popular, though, I posted how the generator works and tried to answer people's questions / implement their suggestions in it. As for "making it mandatory", I think the users should do whatever they want. I think it's a nice little tool, but if it causes a headache (...which it seems to have done), just stay with the box score links. I'll keep posting mine in the Hornets threads, but as for the rest of r/NBA, just stick with whatever works best.

Okay then. `\hahahahah`\Klaymen`\Man, Utah, you had so many chances.`\Went from one of the best offenses with an aight defense to one of the best defenses with an aight offense in one offseason.

He did a sky hook the other day, made our radio announcers go bezerk with happiness.

I don't really follow basketball but Steph has been so exciting so I was going to watch on the ESPN app but couldn't find it and had the time wrong.

As soon as I turn your feed on he hits a half court 3 `\damn, I feel like Steph is usually great at those finishes.
