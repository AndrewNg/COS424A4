Making the playoffs is about winning the games you are supposed to, and maybe escaping with a few extra wins you steal. A win on a back to back in Oklahoma city against the thunder was not going to happen. So be it. You're upset because your team lost, at home, to a team that on paper, they should have beat.

`\Same for them and KD tbh`\I'm fully convinced Curry still lights it up this quarter.`\So at this point, do we just move the team back to Seattle? `\id rather be 6th seed than 4th or 5th`\I did `\But then you look at what's going on right now and it's just been the Westbrook and Durant show

But you know those two don't always ISO because Westbrook has 12 assists and I doubt he was passing to Durant the whole time

I think since Durant subbed in, he and Westbrook put up all the shots except for a Roberson shot and I think an Ibaka dunk. And that's why they've only scored 18 in this quarter. They're not moving the ball around

I'm not hating on the two or anything. I love Westbrook and Durant. But when only one of them is on the court, it's like they play a different kind of Thunder ball.

Basketballs a world sport. NBA is a American league that plays the sport. I have league pass, so I watch as much or more than a shit ton of Americans. So what the difference again? I see the same shit as Americans see.
Therefor not living in America makes me no less ignorant about the league.

Also chokes are the same in EVERY sport. You have a lead where you are almost certain to win and then you lose. Here you go bud, Ill give you the definition.

"In sports, a choke is the failure of an athlete or an athletic team to win a game or tournament when the player or team had been strongly favored to win or had squandered a large lead in the late stages of the event"

Strongly favored to win? Nope. Spurs were large favorites.
Large lead late stages of the event? Nope. 7 points is not large, 3rd quarter is not even really late.

So there you go, by definition you were wrong. Sorry.

Why is Randy Foye still on the court?`\How old is he really? `\Yup, 17 brothers and sisters and the average size just for the girls was 6 foot`\This game blows but there's no need to get upset as a Thunder fan.

I see what you did there. `\We already got Bobby Shmurda feat. J Cole`\It was down to 15 at one point though wasn't it? Those guys haven't gotten any minutes together though, so it's not surprising. It is good to see them get some time on the court. `\I can't believe I'm still watching. It hurts lol`\He doesn't get calls even when he's fouled. It heavily discourages driving.`\Ibaka and Foye are having the *best* seasons in Thunder history`\Golf clap for the T-Wolves, smart play`\Wtf are you doing Russ.`\I can't believe we just stood there on that Paul 3 attempt. Holy shit

Donovan needs to do something about this shit`\He dosetn even need time lol `\He really doesn't get that many calls lol`\i don't even know what to say`\Lol this game is just Westbrook and Morris`\Curious to why?`\He is, but I wouldn't say much better `\You keep saying this but every time they've come in they haven't hit shots `\what's wrong with Durant? buttery hands?`\After a horrible closeout. Then after he scored, he has a turnover and defensive foul.`\I'm just gonna go jump on my neck now :) `\Praise Chris Paul`\Rule change proposed by OKC ownership over the summer: change the game to 3 quarters/thirds. `\Only Westbrook can stop himself. `\Good game Kings, I hope that Boogie isn't too hurt for the road trip. Also fuck the refs, so many bad calls for both teams.`\Look at the originality here`\lol seems like a pretty even trade.`\yes but he had hope to begin with`\Durant keep spamming that shot.`\Lmao gotta love the refs ignoring Smart I guess they are learning`\Clippers are bad but the Raptors? Ehh`\Tweaked his ankle, out for the rest of the night`\Kanter was going off and then we just stopped trying to go to him. `\Just for the record, the thunder are legit outplaying the warriors.`\KD YOU DON'T NEED TO HEAT CHECK AFTER ONE MAKE`\We do have a great overall team...`\England `\Goddammit, Kyle. Another FT bricked.`\yeah, this is some rough shit...`\Do Spurs have points this quarter that aren't from the line? `\Wait WHAT THE FUCK? Did I read that right? `\Lindros comes to mind but more in hindsight.

He was during an era where everyone just thought he was a big baby at 6'4".  The big take when Stevens took his head off in the playoffs was how awesome Stevens was, not what a brutal hit that was (although I think it would still be legal under today's rules right?).

When he argued with management over his concussions, no one sided with him, instead they brought up his jr hockey / pre-draft maneuvering to call him a cancer.`\Hey I'm actually that guy, only I fucking hate cats and don't drink wine - beer snobbery level 11/10, and we're talking liquor, I stick to bourbon. Me and my three dogs, Sadie, Riley, and Aurora all do just fine and we don't need no stinking party when the dubs are on or reading the ASOIAF books for a millionth time is still entertaining. Haters gonna hate.

I just need a fedora and to grow a handlebar mustache and wax the tips to look like some sort of shitty 1850's villain. Then the transformation to full on forever alone will be complete. `\I've got 9 of 21, but I'm probably off. `\Talked so much shit about Spurs i put 100$ on them to win it , lol i just think okc is worse than weeknd hair at 4th`\first time for everything`\Curry looks really winded`\This broadcast is eerily quiet without JVG`\Coach gonna get fired and players gonna have a players-only meeting.`\He's going to have to go to Splinter for some sage advice. `\You could have Hoidberg or Byron`\TRIPLE DOUBLE FOR BEASTBROOK`\Gg`\Their confidence is what takes them to a whole different level. You have to strip them of it completely to even have a shot of winning. `\God damn do I love 2016.  Not criticizing any of you guys, but the fact that we've reached a point where we can literally analyze a man writing 5 periods in a row on social media is truly incredible.`\They're employed by the mysterious Thunder propaganda ministry, if they say something against the Thunder they'll be fired. `\Its not just the 4th its Dion Waiters playing defense like he doesn't give a fuck he don't care to call screens and doesn't fight through them and his offense is just awful .`\relevant: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ctn6GgooNI`\Thunder aten't dead`\OKC is making us sweat like crazy for every point.`\these refs can go fuck off`\Damn that was some hardcore illegal screening there Kanter. Really should've been called on that.`\Tony leaving his man for an open 3`\He's sick.  "Simmons has been ruled out of Saturday's matchup with the Thunder due to illness, Paul Garcia of Project Spurs reports."`\I TOLD you guys that Kyle Singler was amazing.......`\[KD block to euro dunk](https://streamable.com/xfwk)`\The Anderson's got tickets to the game because you are a bad father.`\That's alot of bricks.`\We are coming for the Raptors.`\Celtics need to start shoving on these rebounds.

But I don't know if it is a straight-up effort issue. Serge is a passionate guy and definitely wants to win above all else. It almost feels to me like Ibaka is playing injured, it would explain a few things. Firstly, his offense, and especially his jumper have suddenly gotten a good deal worse. At the start of his season he was scoring 13 ppg on around 50% shooting and hiting 3's in the upper 30% range, pretty reasonable for Ibaka, especially considering he is sometimes the fourth option on the floor. But in the past few months, his percentages have gone way down, shooting around 30% on threes.

I wouldn't be surprised if he was playing through an injury, it would explain him randomly getting rested a few nights ago and it's not like he hasn't done it before. He was still injured when he returned to that Spurs series a couple years back, he talked about it in his documentary. Also, the team was aware of his knee injury last year for about a month before they shut him down. Serge is just and old-school type of guy who will play through injuries because he knows his team need him.

Then again I could be entirely wrong and he might just be a 77 year old man.

`\Games not over until a hilariously pathetic OKC 4th quarter. Let's see if we can lose by 40 in the 4th this game. That's the natural next step`\Teams just don't lose like OKC.

I would also say that he typically responds to criticism by turning the things ppl are bitching about up to 11.

Everyone doing stuff today, huh? That's cool

I've just been [listening to Chvrches](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=faRvIbs1_bA) and recovering from last night

`\It would just be so OKC to blow this`\i really enjoy when we play good basketball and then the majority of time it looks like shit `\ayyyy`\Almost like he tried to steal the ball. Woah. `\Marv you don't have to fake like that was a good pun `\Haha`\The Rams were LAs team to begin with, so them returning home isn't quite the same as having your team stolen.`\Not really . You can waste a lot of energy trying that and still have a whole period left. The warriors know that teams  want to get a big lead so all  they have to do is  keep pace let  the clock  and the starter burn themselves out playing against their bench . Then somewhere around the 3rd or 4th , KABOOM instant offense. In the thunders case it was the 4th when westbrook starts  getting frustrated and taking selfish shots.
|
Not saying it 100% but it looks to me like the warriors know how to finish teams off as they have shown time and time again . `\Just tuned in for the last minute of game time. Has the game been this bad the whole time?`\Parker's looked old today.`\I figured Warriors would win anyway. It's a b2b for the Thunder and they're playing a historically good team at home lol`\Another big win for the thunder. I didn't even bother to watch the 4th because we were killing it the entire game. GG clippers. Y'all will be better with Blake. `\One thing about the Celtics, they don't get rattled.`\Kanter actually had decent defense on that pick and roll :D`\we are so privilaged to have westbrook in this teams`\he's also got kneepads. maybe he blades. `\THAT RIM HAD A FAMILY!!!`\How the fuck does he do that??`\won't last at this rate`\Jesus just looking on. Majestic with his towel on his heead`\wooooooo`\HNNNG`\Sorry for the downvotes for having an opinion. `\Past few games he's been really good. He's still shit offensively though`\I could talk all day about Russell`\Because he's the worst fucking coach in the league, and that's saying something. I can't believe we've won so much, he routinely makes the worst decisions imaginable. `\Get creamed on red dick`\[OKC...](http://m.imgur.com/3IetoJ9?r)`\Sounds like you're a Rockets bandwagon thinking youlk take out the Warriors. Last time you won was...?`\Honestly it's a little clever for Shaq
`\A win tonight and I will cry myself to sleep`\There it is!`\Tried to get away with a chicken wing. Smdh `\they call it how it is, and are a little homer as they should be, but despite westbrook having a shite game they have both critiqued and praised him. so good to hear`\RUBIOoooooooooooooo`\kawhi is tired `\It seems like OKC has been shooting way more threes than usual.

`\25/20/11 lolz`\lmao retarded team `\I died a little more for each brick he shot. Ugh. `\I mean , sure winning does matter. But doing it with flair is flaunting and has certain aura about it ,  that's why Duncan is nobody to casuals and Kobe is God - although fundamentally there are very few things Kobe did better than other greats of his position. But yeah , whatever - NBA is supposed to be entertaining and Spurs do lots of stuff like resting and inventing medical problems that aren't there .

Don't hate me for hating on them for lacking entertainment , for a business that's main driver is providing entertainment.

`\Teams half the time don't even try exploiting his defense. Makes no sense.`\I cringe at those quick 3's KD takes. Like seriously, how about trying a play to see if that works better`\Russ is the point god`\Dur4nt`\where is enes kanter`\The Brazilian Blur`\That was a comical moment.

"IS that Curry? , should we contested? Why is he wide open?"`\BBIQ is a thing.
`\Im getting downvoted while you get upvoted, what gives?

Probably my flair.`\Yep.

xD`\That was classic`\What value does he have as an assistant? `\We really weren't being favored yesterday, I don't know what the Timberwolves were all up in arms about. We play physically inside, and those refs weren't calling shit inside, the Timberwolves did not play very physically at all.`\Dj is one of the underrated passing centers lol`\I don't know if he still does it, but a couple of years ago, he used to fall on his ass after almost every shot`\Serges jumper has been off all year. `\ugh danny green cant shoot the entire season`\This is our lineup that can change the game. Lets do this boys!`\SANDSTORM`\Curry is off this half`\Speights jam! I love it.

He's gets minor injuries like ankle sprains and sore calf, etc... a lot. Also he has a major problem with fouling, I mean even while rehabbing in the D League he will post ridiculous stat lines but still foul out. It's frustrating because he is a big strong guy who can run the floor, dribble, shoot, pass, and IMO would be an amazing starting power forward if he could defend and not foul.`\Wtf are you fucking doing Donovan? Pull this fucking guy. `\GG we fucked up`\Looks like we got Worstbrook tonight. `\"a degree is a degree" - University of Phoenix.`\Yeah let's just leave them a lane right there.

And fucking 1.`\Every time Westbrook bricks a 3, I die a little more inside. `\That's true, but you're still getting way ahead of yourself.  I know the Warriors are the odds on favorites to win this year, but anything can happen, especially with the Spurs dominating like they are.  And next year is a completely different story with free agency shaking up the league.  This is all before considering Jordan's defensive player of the year and 9 first team all defense selections.  Curry has as good a chance as anyone in this generation of joining Jordan in GOAT conversations, but he has a long way to go with his longevity and defensive accomplishments.`\Not guarding Durant off of screens seems like a bad idea `\Has John Henson played like 10 total games this year?`\This shit is ugly`\O`\Kawhi doesnt do it much but when Pop gives him the freedom to create, hes a pretty legit playmaker`\my body is ready`\Seems like to me your defense is ready to play tho.`\Lord, that chocolate woman next to Prince.  `\PLEASE PLEASE `\DeAndre makes all his free throws and KD can't make one. Fuck this game and fuck this uninspired effort`\A choke for the ages!`\Can I get in on this action as well`\Sorry Cameron we have a shiny new hype toy now`\holy shit Westbrook, be gentle.`\Our perimeter defense = hopefully they miss this wide open 3... `\That was...

Fucking garbage.`\Okc would be in Ben Simmons sweepstakes without Russ and KD, how did they manage to surround them with such shit`\I agree with you, he did have a lot of positive impact on the Thunder and picked apart our defense, but 9 TOs is a shit ton. It's hard to win a game when you turn the ball over that much and your gameplan is to limit the Warriors' scoring off of defense. Thunder had 15 turnovers and gave up 13 points off turnovers. That means that Durant gifted roughly 7.8 points to the Warriors as well as losing his team 9 possessions, which is another 10 points roughly (based on Thunder ORTG).

The Warriors beat the Thunder by 15, and they gave away the And-One to Curry + the 3 because they quit after they were down 7+ points with less than a minute to go.

If Durant turns the ball over 5 less times, this is an entirely different game. `\That lead bout to go from 11 to 0 real quick `\He got to the basket so nicely on the last one, too.

If our bench play half as good as they did tonight consistently watch out. `\What is she doing with her mouth? `\I really hope they break the win record. `\That offensive foul against Adams was a fucking robbery. `\I hate these late calls. This is the one thing that really irritates me about the NBA. There is an obvious foul (the Ibaka push). I saw it, the whole world watching the game saw it. Call it as it happens. That's all I ask.

He shows effort, so therefore he's a good defender. He's playing for his last shot in the NBA so he wants to make it count`\Well JV plays well also, but we don't utilize him in the post like we should most of the time.

They really need to step up their defense if they wanna compete in the playoffs.`\Obviously it wasn't a great pass, but you'd hope Howard can catch and finish that close to basketball.  Better than a highly contested shot that we would have ended up taking otherwise. `\/r/nba never acknowledges clippers as contenders. Well here we are without Blake fighting for the third seed.

I still think they were only a 69-70 win team but they won during an expansion year and had a stacked roster.

when a 20ppg scorer joins your team and is your 6th option on offense (R.Harper), you're stacked. Also, when you add Rodman and Kukoc (who could have been an all-star on another team, or at least a 20pg scorer), then you're stacked.


I think the warriors arent that much better than the spurs. The refs have bailed the warriors out of a few games, which realistically puts the spurs just 1 game behind them`\Back in his 20's Ibaka would have been fine for the back to backs but ever since he's hit his 30's he seems to struggle with them`\thunder better let the clips get ahead if they want to stand a chance by the 4th`\True but everyone time he seems to start poorly from 3 he goes on fire later and corrects it overall.
2-6 now, but he will probably finish 5-10 or something.`\As soon as we have the number 3 seed confirmed to be wrapped up we should rest Ibaka for the rest of the season. Dude just looks lethargic. `\was this unexpected?`\It's especially painful when Dion fucking Waiters goes iso for this offense.`\Chokelahoma City, goddamn.`\aye at least adams is having a little block party`\Eh, it's probably a 10 year old just trying to piss people off.`\Lol`\Fucking Klay is ass tonight. He needs to stop looking for his rhythm this quarter and just focus on defense`\Remember all those people who said the Thunder were going to EXPOSE the warriors??? lol`\Have there ever been two triple doubles on the same team in the same night? `\Please don't lose us the lead bench, we need to be able to close out better`\Overachieving is not the right word to describe that. The Celtics play in a fashion that doesn't suit playoff basketball. Which is totally fair, I don't expect us to make noise in the playoffs. Saying we are overachieving just annoys the hell out of me, it discredits what the players do on a game to game basis `\Yea that didn't sound pretentious at all.`\Posting on reddit `\Westbrook is playing awful.

That fucking team...`\>verajo`\I fucking love these new state farm commercials`\Lol Mark Jackson talking about coaches losing jobs due to "mistakes."  `\quick question: What do u think Curry's best game this season was? `\No joke.. With 7 secs.. `\Good thing Aubrey McClendon didn't see that one.`\Finally a foul call, not like Giannis got fouled two drives in a row.`\>Westbrook: 1 point, 5 assists, 4 rebounds (0-0 shooting)

>Durant: 6 points, 6 assists, 3 rebounds (0-1 shooting)

In the first quarter....`\smh.`\STRAIGHT UP. FUCK THESE REFS

edit: Okay he turned, I think that's bullshit that those are called though. The defender is protecting himself from contact. `\You should take BTC donations or something man. Obviously not advertise it or ask for video games lol but I'd send a few bucks your way.`\Jesus Christ Cam Payne can't even get garbage time minutes. I'm fucking baffled.`\in the shower`\We could have played smart and been able to rest our starters for tomorrow, but, nooooooooo`\Fuuck dj!!!!`\what the fuck westbrook`\It's like the defense isn't there`\Can we just get to the game and stop showing these people `\BAAAAAAAAAASKEEEEEEEEETBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAALLLL`\More pick and pop with Kanter`\Horrible call.`\Things I thought were gif-worthy

He saved us from getting eliminated by Memphis in 2014.`\Westbrook with the hate crime on the rim`\Ibaka and Foye... my 2 least-favorite Thunder players`\everytime i see that tshirt machine gun i wonder why the can't just increase the mag`\SINGLER is the splash daddy`\OKC fans say Waiters is trash, but he's always good against us`\Mo!`\lol WATCH, the bench going off tonight and tommorrow, brick city..`\OKC up 23-15 in bench points...never thought I'd read that stat. `\Lol which is a bigger problem for OKC: the lack of offensive movement or defense`\They Choked harder than the clippers`\Clear path. Fuck`\Kanter is so great around the rim. It is absurd`\jesus i look away for 2 minutes...`\Injuries suck man. `\SO GOOD IT'S SCARY

AIR CONGO`\Well if we're not playing McGary in garbage time we're either trading or cutting him this off-season`\I've become desensitized to Brodie's trip dubs`\fucking Danny`\God fucking dammit. Fuck you JJ.`\Go to hiphopheads this is a game thread`\LETS GO QUADRUPLE OT PLS`\Yep, and he takes 4 a game. `\Yeah. Sucks because I love Westbrook. The last few weeks have been really disappointing. `\Of course not, but having a player who scored 111 goals throughout three seasons (176 games) certainly doesn't hurt and he improves their chances tenfold. `\Westbrook plays every game like the opposing team's bus ran over his dog. `\Texas fight`\Don't worry guys, Foye and Huestis will sort this mess out`\That seems like a good idea.  `\Just feed Norm, theres nothing to lose`\The only reason anyone guards kyle singler is because they don't want to get scored on by Kyle Sinigler. Not because he's a threat.`\Nah we'll get it, you mean shots taken right?`\My god will Harden cheat any more? At least Khloe came to her senses

(Was referring to his help defense that gave Morrow 3 consecutive corner 3s)`\Everyone's getting downvoted! \^_^`\"He's been on fire for 9 years"

JVG on his A game tonight...`\but if there were no Curry teams would focus their defense on Klay, making it tougher for Klay to get open shots and it probably would hurt his efficiency. Sure he might still be breaking 3pt records but that would be because he shoots a lot more threes and I highly doubt he'd shoot the ridiculous percentage that Curry shoots`\search for AnotherDuck's comment. That's what I watch.`\Steph shooting like a scrub from 3 and we're still coming back. I feel alright about this one right now.`\Kyle the Lock-down God.`\Probably not without overtime, but possibly`\Waiters!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!`\He is bae`\That was a sweet sign. It still is but it was too.`\The Mo Speights game `\Uhoh zoned out Curry

dominate.bat`\"With Durant open 5 feet away from me"`\i'm in the camp that theres lies, damn lies, and statistics`\Nah, you have your opinion and I have mine. I'll take him with that play most every time. `\Seemed like Durant and Morrow took his "can't make shit at the basket" curse for the night, and with his defense... he killed it tonight`\Unless you're playing against the Thunder's defense, then you can just run pick and pops allllllll day.`\speights for kap confirmed`\THOSE FAMILIES HAVE A CRAVING FOR GARBAGE HOT DOGS`\JB is always complaining in the coaches interview`\I really hate flopping... `\Ibaka has yet to score a point and only has 2 rebounds. `\FUCK YOU REFS!`\On Enes Kanter: "He's one of the most dominant players of his generation. If he wasn't, Kevin O'Connor wouldn't have selected him with number 3 pick" `\wait til he has one bad overall game and listen to the haters`\Adams is damn good at goin straight up`\Feel the same way about Green. One of them will *surely* go in. Right? Please?`\Kinda weird by itself. I wish they also added more things that aided viewer understanding like they do in football. Like highlighting the paint for 3 second violations. Or a sidebar showing the current foul count of players.`\I mean he was in front of him then moved towards him to foul. I just don't get the rule I guess`\Wtf does the arena you play in have to do with how often you foul? IF you don't want the other team shooting free throws you shouldn't foul them.`\a I-blocka`\But where would he be better off going?  I'm not counting the Warriors because that would be one of the most cowardly moves in the history of sports and I can't imagine Durant would want to ride the coattails of Curry to a championship while he's still in his prime.  The Celtics seem to be a good option, but even with my most green-tinted glasses, I can't imagine Durant signing here.`\Can we.. you know.. guard someone?`\I hope we didn't tire ourselves out in the first quarter`\oh come on, he took a dive on that one`\15 triple doubles and 15 wins for Russ. You beauty `\Is he ever sober?`\Iso not gonna work if west dont hit them.`\Shit, NFL never learned it.  Jahvid Best was incredible to watch.`\I was kinda hoping for this to be a quiet game because I've been awake for the last 26 hours, but it's still fun`\its amazing how many thunder players are in place around the net after a missed shot.  Box out.`\Don't cry C's, I expect most of yall to come to our post game thread tomorrow to talk shit if we lose.`\Terry has a pharaoh beard`\that had to be on Shaqtin a fool!`\DAJ a beast`\Golden State are gonna do it, they're gonna break the record.


Mark my words, GS will only lose one more game and it will be against the Blazers again`\Is Waiters the best (or worst?) at getting to the basket but missing his layups? `\Where did i ever cheer against the raps?

I'm making an observation on their caliber of a team based on their play. Sorry you don't like hearing the truth. `\It's regular starter minutes, everyone except Roberson played below their average. Just because the Spurs are resting players doesn't mean the opposing team is.`\Did Harden even touch him on that foul?`\**THAT FUCKING COUNTS**`\Fucking Harden. So damn clutch, giving me a heart attack. We need someone to teach Ibaka to be himself again. He's really starting to regress. He would never miss that free throw. `\Thunder literally just chucking shit up now `\tough to say. At his age and injury history you gotta take it year by year. If his contract ended this year, he'd be 10-12 mil ez`\Yeah but this isn't really getting outplayed. OKC keeps choking in 4th quarters. `\chris paul pick and roll with deandre with durant spotted up would be deadly. yes I left blake out on purpose`\I got you possibly beating us tom on a double revenge game for this game and our last game. `\Reggie just getting fucking abused tonight.`\Reggie Jackson playing like the Monstars before they got their powers`\'If we got more points than the opposing team we could win the game'

Logic`\No shit. I'm talking about how they have constantly blown games in the last quarter. The Thunder are my second favorite team. Its frustrating to watch.`\I don't watch a lot of OKC games, is Westbrook this bad under pressure?`\Kyle Singler is so pasty`\I always get downvoted when I criticize how Durant has been shooting so many 3s lately `\(That reason being 20% of OKC's games)`\Even Gucci Mane saw it and got cold. `\Lol .... Beasley has been back in NBA for almost a month now and I swear I havent seen him pass once

Dude has shot the ball 88 TIMES IN 144 MINUTES!`\Pretty sure he's smelling Harden's beard`\wow that woulda been so nasty`\Wtf was Barnes doing that whole possession. SMH`\[Kanter has magic hands](https://streamable.com/dcby)`\Things have been rough for the Rockets since the Steven Adams trade
`\aaron, pls, stickum`\WTF boogie`\Rubio!! `\Yeah you definitely can't blame any of our series losses on Butler, he wasn't that huge of a part of our team. Also he shot 35% from three in the playoffs that year, which is right at his career average. His overall field goal percentage was low though. I dunno he wasn't great for us but he's a good guy. `\That was a great block by Robertson. `\wow just tuned into the thread, looks like i've got a lot of dicks to suck`\I couldnt catch the game tonight cause of personal obligations, but when i finally sat down just now and saw the score and our record, I yelled at the top of my lungs in joy instinctively. Back 2-3 years ago it seemed like we would never get back to 40 win status again. So happy and proud (I've been on /r/nba and the pistons subreddit for 4-5 years with various handles and lurking), its been a long time coming for us hardcore fans who have been around through the shit years. `\Is every thunder possession going to end in free throws?`\You know that warriors aren't only pulling up for jumpers and are actually driving to the rim? Klay and draymond consistently get wrecked taking it all the way. `\DJ>KD`\must be a part time job`\You would think that by now Donovan would know better than to roll out a fucking Durant-Foye-Waiters-Morrow-Kanter lineup. Terrible coach.`\OKC has had some great assists so far this half.`\FOYE with the career night`\Love seeing Enes the menace playing`\does yo dick hang low does it wobble to the flo....`\ticket sales went up and alot of the die hard fans that made oracle what it was got pushed out by trendy silicon valley money . I usually go 5 times a year but I can only afford 1 this year and it's 200$ for the top level . I'm bitter but it's all good better than alternative.`\That requires something like aftereffects, not photoshop`\you're getting awfully pissy over a game that doesn't matter. the 3rd seed is locked up and nobody is going to care about how many wins you get.`\I have a good university schedule, so I usually sleep at 5amish and wake up at 12 when we have games. If I'm busy the next morning I'll sleep at 5pm and wake up at 11 before the game`\Teamwork `\wow westbrook only has 9 points but has 12 assists`\Westbrook just got 3 rebounds in like 45 seconds.`\Naww, someone just likes being single`\Man durant takes some bad shots`\cousins doesn't seem rattled though`\Knock knock`\well that stupid map they showed`\Holy shit, Kanter couldn't miss anything. WB with the trip dub, nice stuff from Dion and Singler fucking did stuff. It's nice to get the W.

Also, Kings, I love your announcers. `\Warriors ball movement is a thing of beauty.`\Pushed off on Bogut for the rebound. `\hahahaha well played.  unless you're saving this thread for some reason`\Speights Cowboy`\Okc struggled with the high pick n roll, and Johnson got hot`\Let's see if we can keep our streak going :D`\[Oh boy oh Foye](https://streamable.com/uaeu)`\He's been really weird all season for us`\Damn, that was athletic af`\Iggy with the flop, and Kd isn't playing good offense.`\God look at the plastic surgery on her face, you could recycle her`\I'm so confused right now`\All teams should run the "35 reverse", instant points.`\Just wait until they take fighting out of the game. It'll be long overdue but they'll all but lose the 50-79 market segment. `\Fucking sloppy.`\He's been fine defensively. It's just that that turn around J is Mooks bread and butter.

`\nah he thought rubio fouled him on the shot before `\the best we played was against Memphis when we almost 50 pieced them `\Rough rough night for Westbrook`\this is horrendous`\I like how Steph turns it up at the end as a final fuck you to the Thunder. `\I understand your viewpoint.

I guess some events really need more time. I agree that if there is significant number of living people that had been through such tragic events, people should err on the side of caution with these jokes.

It may sound crazy to you, but I live in a country that was right in the middle of WWII tragedies and yet we still have some *really* insensitive jokes about it and have a good laugh. And that doesn't mean disrespect to the people that lost their lives in those years. We all (or at least most of us) understand the magnitude of the tragedy and suffering. But you can't dwell on it and stay superserious for centuries, the survivors are almost all gone and the risk of opening some old wound is really low.`\His intensity makes everyone around him play harder. The way he drives so hard to the rim creates so much room for 3 point shooters, like Durant... I just think he is soooo important to that team, as he would be on any team he played for. He's a winner.`\I've never thought Wiggins was underrated and the only people I see calling shit on him are obvious haters.`\damn kd`\It's Insane that the warriors have a good chance to lose just 5 games this year`\That was a choke + refs, so it was worse than normal `\He's a decent spot up, Payne should be running the offense for sure`\Boston's a pretty good team. They may be having an off night, but getting a good win on the road is something we haven't done much lately.`\Play Ammo now.`\Kanter too strong.`\I can't believe Barnes is going to get a max deal from some bottom feeder team this offseason `\damn OKC gotta do something to stop these cuts.
`\westbrook is pissed and is making braindead plays`\pls russ ._.`\Trent Baalke take notice.`\[KD's hand is still touching it so it's legal](http://imgur.com/OZcyIHf)`\Two words: breakfast tacos.`\Gives us the fucking bucket, Adams was there`\Grown man dunk. `\People will consider you contenders when you get past the 2nd round`\hahahaa`\You think we will ever see Westbrook prioritize wining over thaey stats and plays? `\tripleee doubbleeee`\There's the morrow I've missed from last season! `\It's gonna be a Beastly night boys!`\lol Durant took a little stroll there.`\Is there a reason KD can't play the whole 4th? `\Yep. Donovan can't coach. `\Another Durant fumble

I get downvoted when I mention how annoyed I am at that shit, but it's been happening so fucking much lately. `\I'm loving this D`\This is the brightest timeline for GSW fans`\Its just odd... it feels like watching college ball at times`\Ugh....`\lowry wanted that 3 so bad`\So this is what it looks like when you play with 50% of your salary missing. GG lol`\WTF Westbrook?`\TP isn't making headlines for not making a point tonight `\T R A V E L B O Y S`\Spights........it's real `\You'll get marmalade first, but yes in time you will get honey.`\And Singler is back on.....fuck`\That Tyus jab-step and jumper made me excited.

EDIT: Apparently it made Tyus a little excited too...next attempt was not so successful`\That's a move right out of Vivek's playbook.`\Y'all gonna complain about Dray not getting teched but not say a word about the actual foul ��☕️`\Should be going at curry like rose did when the faced.`\how has durant only taken one three this game? `\Speights for KD straight up would be more than fair, no?`\We should all remember SPEIGHTS was the one who brought this change...`\No it was based on how his game has regressed for 3 years straight. `\I totally believe you`\we're pretty much locked into it tbh

only way we get the 28th pick is if Cleveland wins out and we lose out and we win the coin flip`\Good to see the refs are just horrible all around and not just against us this game.`\So I hear 3esus is playing tonight God dam it's gonna be good`\How long have they had the professor?! I never knew he was on their team, dude always seemed like a Spur.`\Curry doe`\LMAO Bogut `\Get out`\We've had 9 called on us.

You've had 5 called on y ou.

But, no, they're not allowed `\Yeah no`\The Warriors are aight.`\Get em ammo! `\It's strange seeing a 7 footer move like cauley stein does, it makes no sense`\lmao, take the L and enjoy the rest of the game`\With the 2?`\total choke.`\lol this stream tho`\They should fire Scott Brooks.`\Why did i turn this game off, i thought it was over!`\He does a bit but it's more from when he jokes around with the guys, it's been a while since he's smiled from a basketball play`\Lmao. Ginobili was still shuffling. shit call`\Why are they shooting FTs on a loose ball foul? `\Russ elbowing his own guy`\Their job...`\You a bandwagoner then `\ugh`\Thunder level on losses with Clippers now`\Rim - 1

!remindme in 2 weeks`\I have no problem with singler driving to the rim or trying to guard demar`\Wait Bismack Biyombo's career high is 16? Wow`\Yo, our livers: ouch!`\No I admit he's not a good defender now. But it isn't due to a lack of physical ability, because he is extremely quick and has good footwork on offense. And his post defense actually isn't his weak point, it's his defense on smaller players that's bad. I think it's just something he has to learn.`\He has such weird form. But it seems to work for him. `\does okc still hate their new coach?`\Lol`\Lol I thought he had like 20.`\So it was Greg Monroe the whole time? `\Steven Adams has the ultimate rapist look going on`\Durant's playing fine it's the rest of your team that is dropping the ball.`\Kanter, you look regressed man, what's happening
`\K legit you said you'd be ok with losing this game yesterday`\Lol Shaq just naming every white person he knows.`\He's like 25.`\Yeah he did earlier in the first half. `\Add that to the montage of terrible Westbrook 3's in the clutch`\OKC can't close teams out at all.`\Making it to the conference finals every year is too hard :(`\I thought we were done with random 2 guards burning us. Stauskas thinks otherwise. `\That westbrook to roberson alley oop baseline is a designed play isn't it? Happens alot `\Literally any shot, ANY shot that Durant could take on the floor is better than ANY shot that Foye could take. He's beyond bad. Andre Miller is 39 and he's better.

The people downvoting me: are you aware that he is shooting 30% since being traded?`\I see the score on the Kings broadcast.`\That's the only thing screwing my accumulator up and it was supposed to be an easy over game`\Too many wild passes. Hopefully we settle down and our shots start falling more often.`\Lmao Harden forgot Dwight is not using stickum anymore lmao`\Yo somebody has to post the gif of Timmy throwing up gang signs ����`\i love russ but you gotta get it to kd there. he can get off a money 3 in these spots.`\Durant was so close to that triple. Damn Ibaka couldn't hit the open jumper.`\Lol there are no rules in this game. Just do whatever the fuck ya want`\Celtics could fall to the 6th seed before the end of the week.

this has been the most frustrating season in a long time...our team is immensely more talented on paper and we're playing worse basketball, IMO, then we did last year....record might be a little better, but that is more an effect of the West getting a little worse than us getting better`\Yeah the first quarter was a bit different but you all still got your points.`\Steph was fucking garbage in that quarter huh`\You arent going to get that call against KD Mo`\40-20 BLAZE IT`\Do the Russell hustle `\[Russ finds KD for a dunk and the rim shrieks in pain](https://streamable.com/npgn)`\Kyle Singler looks like a wet seal.`\When did he start trying to hit 3s???

`\Dion was the real mvp for golden state tonight `\All stats are from Basketball Reference. I calculate all of the differences from average myself using a script`\Bullshit`\Morrow is a great shooter, but he's top 5 all time in bench reactions. Maybe that's the real reason he never plays. `\right in front of the ref too, but you can't call fouls for dwight. dude gets mauled every game and it's just ignored.`\KD has seriously turned into a ball hog, he's just forcing every shot and there's very little passing`\idk trotskyism`\WTF KD`\way to bail out a choked layup`\Fucking garbage.`\durant busy asking for a foul instead of trying to get back down`\Gotta have possession for that.`\and then hire who? I disliked Billy the Kid/Eddy Munster when he was in the SEC but that was just my homer-ism. He's a good coach and all that college exp I think helps him relate to players today.`\Y'all didn't even make the playoffs last year. GTFO with you two trick pony team. You better pray Durant comes back`\So did you guys see the stats posted that Neto leads all rookies in 3pt%?  That doesn't surprise me at all.  He's money from outside.  Everyone thought his shooting was going to be a liability.`\Some say the Jazz wont score in the 2nd half..`\Oof`\Russell is better. `\Too skrong`\AND ONES FOR EVERYBODY`\Damn, 4th quarter woes continue.`\I'm...cautiously...kinda...optimistic-ish about our chances tonight, but we haven't had a winning record against elite teams all year so far. Fingers crossed. `\Ok, let's not do this guys...`\that and a fat joint, come over bud lets get lit `\that was a foul, zach has every right to be pissed but its KD so nah not gonna be called `\Russel does that cheesy shit my friends do on 2K `\this is a playoff game`\Beautiful pass `\these comments are a good 15 seconds faster than my stream. my faded ass didn't notice till now. `\Welp, we had to let them get back into it right?`\At some point you have to wonder if it's a coaching issue, or a personnel issue`\Nope. He's playing less this year than last. Dallas told him he'd be a focal point in the offense. He's always played in the fourth`\We're 8th in assists this season. There's definitely a difference. The defense was better under Brooks, but I think the personnel are more to blame. `\Fuckin finally the withgoat`\I doubt it, but I guess it's possible `\PLEASE DO!!!`\Let's gooo.`\>pedantics

`\But my meme!! `\Live by the Russ, die by the Russ...`\[Durantula](https://streamable.com/oc1l)`\lol this was not an evenly called game`\[Russ with the beautiful bounce to Air Congo](https://streamable.com/94z1)`\No idea why Lowry is still in, dude should be resting `\I hope Lowry isn't entering his playoff slump again :(

Past 2 years...`\GRANTED, I HAD TO LEAVE EARLY TO HEAD TO WORK. its a joke `\I don't think you can judge that on our play on the road during a back to back`\Russ does it again.`\hey refs what the fuck r u doing ruining this gr8 game of basketball`\God dammit`\Man, that last quarter and a half was tough to watch. Golden State looked leagues ahead of the Thunder. OKC just never seemed to learn from any of their mistakes. They kept trying to force it on offense, and never seemed to have a clue on defense. Hope things turn around soon for them.`\Westbrick needs to rethink his game...those were some brutal bricks`\Happy for these guys.`\one of the reasons i know more about basketaball than you`\Wow, Kevin Durant's BPM is currently +20, while Westbrook is -2.`\That was a really exciting first half.`\He's had worse games in the playoffs`\i hope so`\Destroy his confidence ��`\If we lose this game, it'll be mainly because our guards couldn't do shit on offense. They really need to wake the fuck up.`\This team confuses me.`\IT BEGINS. SPEIGHTS 3!`\You have presented 0 argument either but you're going to act as if you have.`\Extreme pogo. I've seen it all. `\Canter amirite`\He had "zero" in the first half. `\Lmao, sub .500* `\As much as I love this Spurs team, we aren't the Warriors. Westbrook/Durant have a history of turning it up in SA`\Westbrook with the 6/8`\Steph just took a three that, while very deep, was closer than his game winner in OKC... and he absolutely bricked it. lol`\They'd have to lose someone eventually.

Also if KD went there there would definitely be a change in the next CBA regarding this salary cap jump to bust that shit up real fast.`\Bogut hit 4-4 against Atlanta, you sure you want this OKC?`\Westbrook trying to get that 3pt foul that he did in Game 5, but CP3 knows now hehehehe`\WHAT BLOW THE WHISTLE`\Why not put Kanter in for some offense?`\I'm just worried if the fatigue is getting to him to a bit.`\[Enes straight feasting](https://streamable.com/gw20)`\Sure, just give us Durant`\Steph missing that shot goes to prove he's human `\We cracked the code!!`\Free Cameron Payne.`\Klay "Do I have to???" Thompson `\Lol pathetic. Turn this shit off.`\More like 110-102 OKC `\Paul  is so fucking sick man`\Durant's always had buttery hands`\It's his bowl cut `\Hmmm, 2 timeouts is nearly a third of the timeouts you have as a team. But ya, I wasn't aware of the rule either.`\Thunder lost literally due to Westbrook. He needs a coach to tell him to stop being a stupid fuck and no more threes ever `\Whether or not they beat the record, I'm fully convinced this Warriors team is better than the 95-96 Bulls`\he was amazing this game. `\And he played really shitty defense as well`\Well at least if we loose we can blame it on the bed bugs and ghosts.`\Nothing going in right now. Holy shit `\That's at least 2 times Westbrook has lost the ball going at the basket. Only the first time, Ibaka was there to rebound and dunk it`\Damn that behind the back pass by the ref!`\I think you are 110% correct LOL.`\Lmfao Iggy looking like Harden on a drive`\No. Just durant. `\And Rodman and even Harper`\IS THIS VOLLYBALL? MY GOODNESS STEVEN ADAMS`\These girls are playing weak as fuck D. Step it up`\I really like Clint on the floor.`\Belly back in prime form.`\That Pirates of the Caribbean hype vid is one of the corniest things I've ever seen.`\Haha, fortunately I'm not running on 2 hours of sleep, 0 food over almost 2 days, 14 hours of flying over my previous 24 (and 10 of the remaining were at work), and multiple job interviews... so I should be good. `\Lac definitely getting blown out tonight`\I always root for underdogs in games like this, go Thunder`\I am not liking the 2nd half of this game even a little bit. If the Clippers weren't being idiots, we'd probably have blown the 20 point halftime lead

Westbrook and Durant are both taking some questionable shots. Not that it's entirely on them, but the differences between the 1st and 2nd halves is crazy`\The Ish magic has worn off. I see 4 wins max by season's end. `\Awesome! How did you get into OKC and highlights?`\I thought that was a travel but idk `\I wonder what we could get for Ibaka in a trade. Just hypothetically `\I don't know which is worse. that Singler is literally the worst player in the NBA. That he didn't do a single positive thing in this entire game. or that our coach still plays him over Amo and Payne. `\Every rondo triple double `\Fuck Tim Duncan, shave that raggedy gray old man beard`\man, that looked clean`\BEDLAM.`\Serious question, when varejao hit the layup and got fouled... shouldn't it have been a goaltending when curry grabbed the rim while the ball still hadn't gone in yet?`\Mo has a cannon`\BS foul`\Wtf was that Westbrook? That was unneccesary. `\Okay - let's check your comment history!

Hmmm, more bandwagon Warriors circle jerking, some lame advice about that shit hole the Philippines, a couple of visits in way-too-young-for-you female celebrity sub reddits (lol). If you're a legit Warriors fan that's fine by me, but I won't be surprised when you're flair says "Jazz" and you're asking how to get your hair part to look just like Gordon Hayward's. Oh, you better make sure those jpegs of Ariel Winter that you're jacking off are from when she's legal. CURRY FOR THREE ARE YOU KIDDING ME`\That was an expansion year too, wasnt it?`\Love Harris, he's at least 40/40 from the line in his last 12 games or so. Hoping he can keep it up, pretty cool to watch.`\There is sooo much time on the clock. Wait for IT to get a few buckets and ET to score 8 straight at the beginning of the 4th`\���� we finally beat a press`\KAWHIBUNGA TIME!!!!!`\Spurs missing wide open shots they normally make. Just like in the first game of the season series the Warriors missed wide open shots and kept us in the game until the end.`\FUSH N CHUPS BRUH`\Deandre shot greater than 50% FT, league fucked`\I'm jealous, the 76ers get cool halftime shows`\put Coty Clarke for Tyler Zeller`\teams getting into playoff mode`\GG detroit. `\Nice D Foye`\Singler has actually been getting some love recently on r/thunder. Along with his D he's also shooting above 40 percent from 3 in 2016!`\Warriors aren't playing tonight.`\The 3 point line lighting up is cool^(/s); they might as well add the paint lighting up for 3 second violations, and exploding pop-up text for missed calls and daggers.

I'm mainly kidding, but I almost wouldn't mind it on replays of games on NBA TV, like Cops 2.0.

Good night folks.`\Durant had 9 turnovers. That isn't great either.`\My favorite new centipede :D`\[Ibaka and-1](https://streamable.com/9omn)`\Lol, I just got what you meant.`\oh man I think westbrook got his hand stepped on in the scrum`\Just go back to Saturday night and you'll see a similar choke.`\Take fighting out of the NHL, are you crazy? It's already become decently rare, and the only players who engage are obviously willing. If you take fighting out of the NHL, you might as well ban boxing and MMA as well. `\Going through the motions like this is not going to get it done against the Thunder. `\LMAO Young developing nicely. `\Hes better than Augustin`\Lmao that's so classic rockets. I wouldn't be mad if we lose to Jazz next game just to fuck the Rockets twice this week. `\Quickest release I've seen from Ibaka on that 3.`\You should see what an A's playoff game is like, imagine walking across a 20ft wide pedestrian bridge that is about 1/8th of a mile long, then crowding onto a train platform with 20k other people.

I can understand it here, I don't know what the situation is at other stadiums.  I went to a overtime game this year against the Nuggets, leaving that sucked so hard.

>> `\DION our missing link`\Norman Powell bb ty`\We all had it twisted...`\I mentioned that awhile back and so many Thunder fans got mad at me`\Never seen so many delay of game calls`\But...the game was sold out!`\Why is everyone making a fuss about Dave Chappelle at the game? Doesn't he usually attend Warriors games? `\I was screaming it at the TV at one point. 7/11 from inside the 3 point line. That's where he needs to stay. Driving is his bread, and that stop'n'pop is his butter. He needs to keep it there.

But if he doesn't, it is what it is. That level of superstar is allowed to have flaws. `\I'm still clinging to the fact that the Clippers are 1-0 all time against the Warriors in the playoffs.`\If Kyle Singler fouls everytime he has to defend a post up, we're better off having Huestis and Morrow on the floor`\they have a top 4 squad in the NBA and KD gives up a shitload of money to leave. there's a pretty low chance he leaves`\mean :(`\Ties with Fat Lever if he gets this one right?`\It happens very few times where Lowry and DeMar both have a bad game tho`\Holy shit all of our shots are back rimming.`\Right call though.`\Adams is good on offense and better on defense. Kanter has ok defense and great offense. Better for us to have bench scoring as Kanter can do it on his own and our starting 5(namely 2) have enough scoring. . Now the reason he doesn't close out games is a mystery. `\Westbrook's line is so fucking good. And then you get to turnovers.

5-6, 12 points, 8 assists, 8 rebounds, 1 steal... 5 turnovers `\OKC hitting everything from downtown and crushing the clippers on rebounds = us up by 19`\bruh singler CANNOT stay with him, we need somebody with quicker feet on him`\Her skin is very nice.`\Filthy.

The Thunder would not be able to get meaningful contributions from guys like Barbosa, Speights, and Livingston like the Warriors do. Same with Spurs guys like Mills, Simmons, Anderson, hell even danny green. It's part coaching, part Durant/Westbrook.

We found our ace in the hole. All we need to do to win is run 35 reverse. Every. Single. Play.`\Have you seen how the Cavs are playing lately?`\Here's the thing with Ibaka: He thinks he's now a shooting big man. The guy used to be all about the paint, claiming that it's his and shit on defense, while beating people in the paint on offense.

Now, that he's shown he can make a three, he stays out in the perimeter for 20 seconds of the shot clock. Certainly not just a Donovan scheme, since he did it last year with Brooks. He'd rather take a jump shot than to try to do post moves.`\Amen. `\Barkley isn't there thankfully`\And if you don't like that, you don't like Timberwolves basketball.`\I don't know why this is getting down voted. OKC wins in a by 15+ with Durant and Ibaka...`\I wasn't planning to reply to any comments I got on this because it's just the same stupid arguments about hack-a, but then I saw this

That is just factually true.

You guys can win 98-0 the next 15 seasons and still have a losing franchise record. Gtfo`\This is way more painful than I thought it'd be`\Varejao hustle keep it up`\it means you shouldn't complain about it `\copy paste from last night`\Embracing that villain role.`\I approve of this plan`\> chill out

When did I panic? I simply stated that while I don't agree with the practice, refs have a tendency to not call as many fouls in the playoffs (exception: Wade 06').

 I think we have the talent to make a deep run in the playoffs this year, but if we rely on the refs to call a lot of the ISO touch-fouls at the basket to get points at the line then expect a drop in scoring efficiency for both Lowry and Derozan.

I've said the same thing all year, this is  not a one-game over reaction from me. `\MAybe `\You proved my point. `\Lmao, the 3rd seed is locked up and OKC is resting players. Like I said, who cares? `\Anyone making a gif of those reddick hip thrusts?`\Can barely tell Prince and Joe Lacob apart. `\Yeah I don't know what his issue is either`\Terrible shot selection by Waiters`\Warriors up 9 with 4 minutes left...

Y'all are bros `\Damn, Russell with 6 TOs, hope he doesn't get anyone, otherwise this has been an absolutely fantastic game from him. `\Heeeeeeeeeeeeeeeere we go again..`\[Ya Hoser](https://youtu.be/5WasYK2kDLU)`\Wow. `\kd a beast`\show prince on the kiss cam`\Donovan's sicrit plays`\Thunder bench the most dejected people on the planet the past week and a half.`\Curry's stat padding at this point.  `\Panic in the 4th. Westbrook doesn't always make the best choices but when they're down in the 4th, Westbrook goes to hero ball. If they just slowed down, they could've regained the lead`\Rest
`\It bothers me how similar randy foye looks like Westbrook. `\But shouldn't casspi be starting in the absence of Rudy? `\[Westbeast](https://streamable.com/pkrv)`\thats why i fucking said it`\oldest team in the league, we're gonna have two 40 year olds by the playoffs

I think if Kawhi didn't get hurt against the Heat he'd probably have played, but whatever.`\Ahahah coming from a Thunder fan, I'm dying`\Just keep shooting Russ`\3 point play the hard way`\At this point,I don't even think they need him anymore. `\Adams is a savage`\Russ with only 5 assists but we're up 20 and will push 100 this quarter. Kind of surprising. `\Good lord Danny, 0-7. Did talking to that trash can somehow make him worse?`\Good guess `\Most intense final 2 minutes where no one scored. `\Westbrook has a vendetta against Curry.`\I think you mean paradox, but I get what you mean.`\This run out the shot clock on every possession strategy by OKC is genius`\Lol. Me too. Also, [we need more football references in our basketball ftw.](http://giant.gfycat.com/AcceptableFoolhardyBasil.gif) `\Fucking Steve Blake `\Pretty important information though `\Like someone just farted on his grandmother.

He looks disgusted and appalled.`\No offense, but isn't that the Thunder's problem against every team lately?`\Durant got crossed `\Cheers!!!

Another first round exit. Blow it up Masai`\u must be delusional to think a non-playoff team (yours) can take the raptors to 7 games let alone beat them.`\He always acts like this. `\make the open three barnes `\do you see anyone else moving off the ball? what the fuck else is he supposed to do?`\Good riddance, the slurpee machine is always out of order and those hot dogs survived a nuclear explosion. `\That was a nice pass `\Waiters is still fucking him, though. Durant has set him up more than a few times here at the end`\....he got pushed into him....`\It's our usual "go 4 minutes without scoring" part of the game`\Bad yes.  But saying they are similar to rockets fans is like when people say things are similar to Hitler/Nazis.  "My boss is a Nazi."  Oh really because she feels you should be on time?`\Aww poor guy...`\Holy fucking shit!! OKC fans necking themselves right now..`\ya no team is messing with gsw forget it`\What the fuck happened during the all-star break....

`\Can't get Kanter in quickly enough. Desperately need his scoring. `\Foye almost breaking Ibaka's arm picking him up`\Don't forget the Ted Cruz and Hillary Clinton ads because of super tuesday tomorrow`\I think almost all of our players has had a moment in this game where they fucked up when they shouldn't have.

Westbrook? Yes

Durant? Yes

Ibaka? YES

Morrow? Yes

Foye? Duh

Roberson? Yes

Payne? Yes

Waiters, Kanter, and Adams are the only 3 I can't think of any fuck-ups for

Glad we pulled out a win, and hopefully we can get back to how we've been for the past week or so now`\If we could have Crawford and JJ on our team I would be so happy. `\I love when Mo applauds his own plays.`\Halftime shows have been on point lately. Every time I go to a game its like 125 middle aged women doing Jazzercise or a bunch of dumb kids singing terribly. `\You guys are the 3rd seed in a historically great top heavy conference. Don't be such a narcissist. This isn't the end of your season. Its one game`\We don't either. At least we still match-up with the Spurs well. To be completely honest, part of me almost doesn't want to beat the Spurs and get to the WCF if it means we get wrecked by the Warriors and deprive the world of a Warriors-Spurs seven-game series.

Obviously I'd like to see a Finals run first and foremost, but if we're doomed not to get out of the WCF, I'd rather see GS and SAS throw down more than a mediocre GS-OKC series if we keep playing like this. Maybe we'll come together, but we're 1-6 since the break even though we're healthy and rested.`\I know/knew. I was thinking we cut him after the preseason last year, but it was actually two years before that. I fucked up...bad`\Anderson Varejao has been granted asylum`\that's correct`\Yep`\As soon as we have the number 3 seed confirmed to be wrapped up we should rest Ibaka for the rest of the season. Dude just looks lethargic. `\i posted that I thought draymond was better than kawhi with that flair`\It's like she's de-synced`\Am I the only one who hates that god awful singing college comercial`\OKC looks pretty winded right now.`\curry getting an offensive rebound is unacceptable with Ibaka right near him. Box out you fucking idiots. I want a close game not a choke.`\KD deserves pancakes after this while we talk about a dubs future.`\ok`\Russ with the "I don't care how many I miss" game.  7 of 24 damn`\He still should have held on to the fucking ball instead of dribbling out of bounds. `\my boy might fuck around and catch scott skiles tonight`\gotta guard reddick better
`\that's way LeBron traded your ass Waiters`\How is Green not T'd up by now?`\[Every time we enter the 4th quarter] (http://dunk360.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/jordan-crying.jpg)`\Fuck this Durant was hacked, turning this bullshit off`\As a neutral observer, GS was absolutely not the team getting the benefit of the doubt the first three quarters.`\Not over yet. Warriors need to throw some daggers`\Fucking Savage!`\I mean, honestly, they had a fairly easy schedule to start, and yes, it wasn't impressive without having faced up against OKC and SA. That being said, now that we've seen them play the stronger teams and win, it's just that much more impressive.

This is history man. Something most of us might not ever see again. It's impressive either way. Heh`\Russell killing it in the paint`\He's part of the 80%`\Why are all my commercials in Spanish right now? `\Will someone please give Westbrook a job so he can buy better clothes and not look like a ragamuffin? `\He started getting average at outside shots, now takes most of his shots from there for some reason`\relax bro we were 1-4 since A.S. break :P`\He's 26`\Curry has the ability to make shots like THAT. 25% is still a lot better than 12.5%`\Hate to say it but Durant would be better off leaving`\Eric Lindros anyone? That guys career was ruined by concussions and cheap shot injuries. He was supposed to be the next big thing. Still great but his career was definitely cut short.`\It's so fucking baffling. `\3rd in WS. Scores like a motherfucker and has rebounding to match it. It's all good`\Lol Adams doing kiwi moves and getting that tech again `\CP3's load just got a bit heavier`\Weird, but dope, right? He's doing all the stuff people have been calling for: staggering, more small ball, playing Payne..`\IT'S HAPPENING`\I love me some Westbrook, but wtf was he thinking with that shot? Also, talk about an overrated defender! He is just not as effective as he should be given his size and athleticism.`\Jeez. Absolutely swept. I feel bad for Thunder fans. They've got some things to figure out before the playoffs.

I'm a little disappointed. After their last few losses, I expected them to come into Oracle pissed and ready to murder the Warriors. `\Can we just not play Foye`\Cam is playing!!`\omg good game`\Westbrook smh`\Come on guys, let's have a good second quarter!  It's been a long time...`\I wonder who Kyle hangouts with that tells him his haircut is really cool. `\It looks like a pretty good crowd to me`\2012 and 2013 were his best years defensively `\Belinelli needs to fuck off`\wtf Kawhi?`\Why is Waiters in the game at this point? Who's going to fall for his patented "jab step, jab step, jab step, go left shoot a fade away mid range jumper. Also, can Wes Johnson make some damn shots? `\I'm sure not everyone when they go to games watches 100% of the game without checking texts, social media, or doing something else. What's the big deal that this girl didn't see Steph shoot another 3?`\Yeesh. So Durant is pretty important eh`\he always struggles in this building`\This is normal boogie `\Over react much?`\Teehee`\Damn KD so scary`\> I don't think he's nearly as bad as the reddit meme tribe has decided,

To be fair, the person who wrote that masterpiece has since written a followup admitting that Singler is no longer the worst. He actually was that bad when the meme tribe initially convened. `\Yea I really believe CP3 knocked down Kanter.  `\It seemed like he looked right at a wide open Steven Adams then gave the ball away`\KD wants the Celtics to win`\I didn't realize Jeff Withey of all people could get me excited during this game.`\STOP TAKING 3S PLEASE`\KMart coming in, please make a shot!!!`\flooooooooooop`\How are you going to complain about not being held in the same breath as GSW and SA, but then go on to be humiliated by them`\already has more comments than your average magic game thread `\Yeah but fuck richard sherman.`\Has anyone listened to Prince early work? That stuff does not age well at all.

So much old music sounds great even today, but early Prince is so damn bad.`\He would have made it if he had a defender jumping at him and be was falling out of bounds.`\Shout out to Randy though`\From what I've read, and I'm  open to discussion about it, but isn't sanctioned fighting in hockey is justified because the alternative is that an angry player who can't fight would be more likely to do something more dangerous (high speed hit, blindside, something with the stick) than punches to the face would be?`\As incredible as he is in many facets of the game, Westbrook's poor bbiq is quite apparent on the defensive end and in late game situations.

I love watching and rooting for the Thunder but I never feel confident when Westbrook has the ball in clutch situations.`\That's some great art.`\Thank God the Spurs won't hit 70 wins most likely, their fans would have been even more unbearable`\Stop talking about FT%s Marv`\I get the feeling that Ibaka just isn't passionate enough about being a great basketball player to take the next step...`\"Know?"
That flint water is getting to your brain`\You're complaining?`\it's not that weird. Westbrook is Westbrook
`\Yep, Lindros was the first guy that came to mind. Hell, I don't even think Crosby's concussion (which was a concussion followed by a brutal misdiagnosis of a completely separate issue in his neck) was the come to jesus moment, though. If anything, it was [Cooke's hit on Savard](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b41ufiDRwc4) that prompted them to take things more seriously and rush the new headshot ruled into place. At least that's how I remember it.`\Man DeRozan has been doing a lot of that lately, getting rid of it to a teammate with 1 second left`\I take full blame :(`\They have a much better team this year. Much better. And they're missing their starting 3 right now. `\Sloppy ball all around.`\I like watching dmo. Is it me or is he still off from injur?`\Westbrook needs to cool down. `\Can't tell if the Thunder come out flat after blowing it against the Clippers or they come out swinging.`\How do you get 15 assists playing iso?`\OKC needs to put this game away. But I hope DMC is okay.`\/u/judgejbs you going to this game in your backyard? `\A POINT PER POSESSION IS PHENOMINAL`\Lol Westbrook what a stupid foul `\steven adams looks like a dude that wears a kimono at home`\Oh my goodness, that block.`\Damn dude `\yea the thunder are bricking but credit has to go to west. those 6 straight points really got the team going. `\The same thing has happened the past two years with our ISO oriented offence running into the brickwall that is playoff defence/officiating. Though Casey has included more player movement in his offence (mostly off the ball stuff/decoy actions) this season but it's still my fear that when things get tight our offence will stall and turn into Demar/Lowry playing heroball. `\Harrison max contract Barnes FTW`\Durant with his 5th block lol`\Tbh tbh tbh`\<3`\Damn Durant abused Kawhi on that last play`\It really is serious, sorry just getting into watching ball.`\Flopping and exaggerating contact are two different things.`\don't forget the westbrook pull up J on a fast break`\Back to back? Against the dubs? Lol no, ID just take the L and rest KD and Russ.`\my plans fell through because /u/riders994 had my friend [shot](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/4agh9s/post_game_thread_the_okc_thunder_defeat_the/d10z63x), so I'm watching the game tonight. I ordered pizza so that's nice`\9:30 ET`\Yeah it's been a rough year for sure `\Those are his two biggest strengths. `\3 point`\Cavs flair tho`\What happened to Ibaka's shot?`\What the fuck kind of drugs did Westbrook and Durant take at half time man. `\You got to get the 40 *before* the 20.  `\LOL oh man perfect thanks!`\Huestis!!!`\DOOOOOWNTOWN`\If Curry shoots, it's a foul. Got it.`\Celtic Fans: How important is Jae Crowder to the team? (Serious)`\jason terry, upon seeing the FT rim about ti rim out "awhhh hell yeeeahuh"

i chuckled`\Cant ever remember Westbrook ever flopping like that cat CP3`\that last shot by okc... wow`\yo had to get lunch hows this game gone so far?`\Scott Brooks rolling in his grave `\No need to bring leBron into this`\Yeah that's Noel's go to move lol`\Kanter with that 15/10 in 15 mins`\I could honestly say he is a top 3 Center in the league.`\I hate Singler, oh my fucking god. PLEASE, get him outta there.`\Whaaaaat `\right? that was inexcusable... but i guess the meltdown was bound to happen`\I think they've been perfectly fine. Can't complain about everything.`\Bogut either looks like he's in pain all the time or constipated. `\Does anyone else`\What are they going to do when he falls to his death in front of a stadium full of people? Little Johnny at his first basketball game is gonna see this old dude go splat because his shaky ass fell off the giant chair ladder he constructed.

The lawsuits would take *years* to play out. What judge is going to be sympathetic to "well your honor, in our defense, he was *really really* good at climbing on chairs most of the time". It's patently ridiculous. Absurd. You all mark my words this will end poorly for that old flamboyant hero. `\You're really going all in in the "act like a 12 year old" bit, eh?`\Don't be flattered, KD has had a turnover problem recently. `\Yet, so beautiful.`\Kick ball?`\I wouldn't be too pleased with the first half performance - okc was very disappointing.

They really need Ibaka to step up and be the interior force he once was. Hes been poor this year. Hopefully this will give him a boost.

Kanter has been solid but his first half performance was terrible. Definitely a tough matchup for the Spurs off the bench (I think hes DD in every game) but his defense needs to be more consistent.

KD is one of my favourite players to watch and is just so smooth. Westbrook is a superfreak of a beast but OKC really need old Ibaka back.

And I agree - will be a great series so long as neither of us drop out.`\Dude Speights is the missing piece`\If the Clippers blowing a game is chalked up to them "pulling a Clippers", isn't that withholding credit from the other team? If the Clippers having a comeback is chalked up to the other team "pulling a Clippers", isn't that withholding credit from us? So it goes both ways. Which sounds more or less fair to me, even if it's kind of off-kilter.

And honestly, the Clippers all rallied and played well in the 4th tonight, but KD and Westbrook also helped by shooting themselves in the foot.`\lol wedgie rim during the break`\Career high at home, his actual one is 48`\Fucking do. I can't stand the Miami fans. I also love Kemba`\I think he thought he was. Would have loved to see him rim check it though`\IBAKA and Biyombo are a combined 83 years old`\Your turn lol`\Does Aldrich not know Kanter can shoot the midrange `\Waiters kept us in the game tonight, imo he gets the game ball tonight at least. Otherwise it usually switches off depending on the night for those two. `\Number of assists != Elite Passer.

Everything else you listed that wasnt bitch made("Ferocious Competitor") is due to his elite athleticism, not skill. Just give it a few more Championshipless seasons until that elite athleticism dwindles. Then you'll just have a turnover machine.`\Wtf man, we are not defending Curry well at all. `\Ibaka just blew KD's triple double too lmao`\He had some furious stats padding at 4th /s`\I'm not overly fussed, just pumped to see McGary get some minutes`\The OKC bigs are too strong for ours to handle.`\Coulda shoulda woulda `\Based Beasley`\is sage steel disappearing.  she's getting skinnier every time i see her.  also, doug collins is dressed like he doesn't give a fuck`\Dmo is in over both of them which is way better.`\gg`\they changed that rip through rule because of him`\does bogut shoot 3's?`\SP3IGHTS`\MOST WESTBROOK SHOT EVER LMAO`\we start hitting some outside shots and we will pull away this game.`\Danny has a foul and unpleasant odor!!`\I don't think any team should to be honest. `\Man. Refs were terrible all second half for both sides, holy shit.

We deserved the loss with our 76 turnovers though.`\Seriously, Parker drives me crazy. `\You're looking at this in the most backwards way imaginable. If OKC's only way to win ball games is KD having a flawless 35 points every night you're in deep shit come playoff time.

You lost by *one possession* and your team shot 39% without Durant. How can you even begin to pin this loss on him.`\damn dat mop boy is on the grind`\Splash`\[something like this?](http://i.cdn.turner.com/drp/nba/warriors/sites/default/files/finished1.jpg)`\What in the fuck is going on there?`\Kmart we used to be friends right? Please be gentle`\*flails*`\Yea you want Moberson, but what if you get Rorrow?`\Only a 2 point lead so not cocky yet. But I am liking the driving by klay and steph`\Where is GSW scoring going to come from with this lineup?`\MO SP3IGHTS SPLASH UNCLE`\No one is going to feel sorry for yall when it happens to you. Yall are known for it.`\I fucking hate my fucking life what the fuck is this fuck fuck fuck`\I don't think Waiters could have been more open.  `\He needs to work on slashing in the offseason.  Gotta coach away the tendency to shoot so many threes when he's not good at them.`\Agreed. He's been having good games a lot more often. Hope he's healthy and gets in shape this summer`\Could've rested KD and Ibaka on separate nights, all I'm saying. `\Kanter!`\You're right`\Donovan stopped me from throwing my remote at the TV.  Thanks Billy!`\wow that's impressive?`\yooooooo MARESSEEEEE`\Steph shoots pretty poorly when he's wide open like that. I think it screws with his timing.`\How Reggie Jackson feels right now

http://imgur.com/8xACjHY`\Lol i choose singler with roberson over waiters w roberson.`\idk how much longer i can watch this game`\pretty sure dion traveled there`\I would love to see his 3 pt shots made in the first half vs second half, I feel he never shoots in the 4th qtr out of fear of missing.`\Two of our assistants are still out. Monty Williams is still grieving for his wife and Mo Cheeks had hip surgery, I think?`\Is kanter the highest paid bench player in the league?`\plays with zero intensity`\Probably his lack of defense. Fantastic shooter but OKC needs more defense, not offense`\MO has been so money today`\He's the Brazilian blur. That's how. Oh and steph learned how to finish from him`\[Mr long-legged mack daddy](https://streamable.com/f569)`\KD with the +30`\Singler so good`\Well to be fair, so did Steph curry`\Kobe had atrocious shooting nights quite often while taking 30+ shots a game and still won 5 rings though.`\Im surprised no one knew it. They only reported it like a billion times when kawhi became an allstar.`\Singler looks so fucking weird`\Good job Serge`\What a crazy comeback this has been.`\Mo Speights is the greatest quarterback in the NBA. `\He'll appoint Harrison Barnes as the new justice to the Supreme Court.`\[Adams gets it from Russ and hammers it home](https://streamable.com/sgqn)`\Poor Westbrook`\Just imagine how good KD could be on defense if he just wore shorter shorts.`\Its on tidal. Jay Z ain't playing bruh. I'm getting that student discount tidal though on free trial still.`\and people say they are the best chance against GSW. I would rather bet on Spurs tbh.`\All these comments that are complaining and using fam and dawg sarcastically are the ones parodying and criticising. Those who use them seriously are embracing it.`\HAPPY BDAY ANDY`\Would hate to play the Thunder after a 2 Game losing streak.`\Let the garden get loud`\Bruh Westbrook would be the best player in the NBA if he shot 3s like this all the time`\lmao what is Kanter doing?`\Not much you can do about a bad first half in the fourth quarter. Had that jam to break up the game and keep our lead before hitting a bunch of clutch free throws. `\Yeah, I just noticed that he gets it done `\this game shouldn't be this close, but it is inspite of all the missed 3s`\PRINCE WAS SITTIN COURTSIDE GAME BLOUSES`\Fucking thing SUCKS!`\KD and Westbrook will kill it tonight, believe me.`\OKC Mental status: Midget`\Things I thought were gif-worthy

The thunder had a few when the warriors didn't.

- Russell, give the mother$#%@ing ball to KD. You are ice cold from 3. Even if you weren't, KD is still better from 3. And he is 6'10 and can always get a shot off.
- Dion Waiters is so thirsty it's embarrassing. No step back 3s and no shooting off the dribble. Try not to abandon both offensive players when Ibaka shows on a screen to help out. Waiters had two boneheaded plays in the 4th that the Warriors converted on to build a lead. It was so aggravating and I don't give a shit about the Thunder.
- Holy shit Waiters had a +/- of (24).

I know everyone knows this, but a couple of boneheaded plays coupled with a few beautiful plays from livingston, iggy, or barbosa are what decided this game. Thunder need to institute the "no shooting unless it's catch & shoot off a nice pass, or your name is Kevin" rule.


Apart from those plays, the Thunder were hanging in and the Warriors had no answer for KD or Ibaka (hint, more KD and Ibaka).

A PACK OF WILD DOGS TOOK OVER AND SUCCESSFULLY RAN A WENDY'S!`\It's a meme at this point, someone made a post about Ibaka lying about his age and actually being 30 something years old because he is from Africa. The proof was that he is losing skill while being 28? i think, and that should be the most productive year from a basketball athlete, so obviously he is 33. And so a meme was born.`\It's painful to watch. `\Russ with 21-13-15, Harden with 24-7-16, and Ibaka looking like he's still 33 with the foul and missed free throw in crunch time.`\Points (now) for Tony!`\well, worstbrook has already arrived`\eh...we need the depth and have struggled to find it. Thompson was useless and Varejao is looking pretty useless as well. I wouldn't be hating on our 3rd string big man.`\well, at least the Clippers are only a game behind the thunder `\And they're overachieving with a broken roster`\He's 33 years old give him a break

/s`\Typical Waiters`\immovable just fyi. And yeah KD vs Kawhi is my favorite matchup to watch. And it keeps getting more intense as Kawhi improves his game. `\are you /u/markjackson`\[Fucking bush league.](http://i.imgur.com/OARwYiu.png)`\He was straight holding Durant's arm. Clear foul that should have been called`\I envision him as an Avery Bradley type player in the future.`\Am I the only one thinking that wasn't a block?  It looked like a goaltending`\He's not.

It's fucking 10:55 and I have work at 7am. Damn come on now.`\Ah ok`\YEah that series would last five games.`\lol`\To a certain extent, I guess so.  It's not rocket science to see that offenses based on ball movement like the Warriors have are very successful but you also need the right personnel for it to work.   Although it also takes a very talented coach like Kerr, Popovich etc. to successfully implement a successful offensive system.`\I miss him ):`\Peace yall `\Because we've hit 6 FG`\Contenders? The Warriors already won the championship.`\Foye is trash`\SLIM REAPER AND THE POINT GOD`\he was legit hurt the whole game tho, i could understand being mad with a 7 foot mofo fucking around with my hurting foot `\Donovan is a bad coach, is anyone still going to downvoted me for this? Took him 60 games to stagger kd and rw minutes, and still plays Dion waiters down the stretch. Anyone would be better. `\Ball movement. `\Paul is killing us`\Lol Westbrook. That was horrible.

The team misses Monty Williams. They just haven't been as good since his wifes passing. `\Lol that possession. `\bc donovan has no balls`\Westbrook should do track and field instead. `\Well, they beat the MJax Warriors, while Dray was a rookie, and while Bogut was out and they had to resort to playing Jermaine O'Neal.

Pretty big difference between that team and this current edition`\Woah, Withey is getting some run. Its been a long time. `\Well I wasn't expecting this from the Celtics.  Still plenty of game left though.`\When bae thinks she fam but the squads mixtape is low key savage af. ✋��������������`\love him or hate him, harden is by far carrying the rockets. its more like his teammates are garbo`\Hey, isn't choking normally clipper's job?`\The thunder would be good if the 4th quarter didn't exist `\LOL YOU CAN'T CHASE BOGUT`\People keep saying Westbrook is top 5 but every time I watch him he throws up the worst shots playing hero ball. `\Fuck Kevin Duraaaaaaant!!!!!!`\KD almost has a 30 point triple double with Serge & Westbrook getting 20, but GSW still wins by 15. I'm not sure what more OKC can do.`\Yeah, sure /s
Kanter is no Ilyasova. He is born in fucking Zurich, Switzerland.

Ilyasova is from Uzbekistan. He was brought to Turkey when he was in his teens, and yes, his age was reduced when he became a TUrkish citizens.

But Kanter, hell no bro. He is born in Zurich, and his father is not some herder in Central Asia, but a professor of biology - histology to be precise. In fact, Kanter's family was in Zurich for his father's research when he was born. `\wow jb has 4 guards and dwight...wow....`\This is so annoying. I don't get it. They must've ran a train on Donovan's wife. No other explanation. `\He has them wring "Like Mike" inside their shoes`\Bogut making Zoidberg noises`\The NBA need to put the pressure on them.  Win the title in the next 3 years or Seattle gets their team back!`\That pass by KD was absurd.`\I'm to pissed off to make the joke`\I don't know why, but I thoroughly enjoy that Galaxy S7 commercial with Lil Wayne pouring champagne on his phone`\eh`\Wtf is happening?`\S.P.A.M`\Just like we've anticipated: Stephen Curry vs. Kyle Singler`\You gotta put some mustard on those fries.`\Holy shit, Westbrook has been fucking awful all night.`\KD is down, and we didn't capitalized hard enough.

So fucking good.`\holy shit.`\Draymond just bitched Durant with that block`\What the fuck happened?`\Undefeated in Chuck the Condor ERA`\The Thunder have been so terrible in the clutch as of late that it hurts me as a non fan. `\The trade deadline passed. You literally can't trade him. `\HOLY FUCK A 3 WHAT THE FUCK IS THIS`\Hmm, but they had to use two timeouts. That would have been valuable if the Rockets managed to hit a three at the other end and the Thunder were down with a short clock.`\Well what do you want, Roberson or Westbrook to have to run through like 3 screens to get to him? He has even more time that way. At least they have a body in front of him`\Classic Donkey`\Nah, Clippers up 3-1 against Rockets with game 5 winning by 20 and ending up losing the series is the biggest choke I think. This is pretty bad though.`\it does, they also choked last night against the master of choke itself, Clippers. I have made up my mind`\damn i hate it, but its catchy `\http://i.imgur.com/vKCskZG.png`\Plays Singler and Waiters too much yeah. Other than that he has been fine with lineups. I think he's saving Morrow a bit for the playoffs... Hopefully`\Just a reminder we got Marcus for a 2nd rounder.`\Just give it a lil time. We look good tonight. `\It isn't even due to great defense on either side. Both sides are playing good/decent defense but not great.`\ Paul is up there for sure.`\15 triple doubles and 15 wins for WB`\The refs aren't why we're losing`\Our bench has been struggling for the last  minutes, and our coach hasn't figured out to put our best bench scorer (that is Kanter) into the game yet. We really have one retarded coach for sure. `\God I had to pee at the end of the game someone link me to that Westbrook shot that sounds classic`\Yeah okay what team is better than us that will take him`\I don't think this year is gonna be his year man unless he puts up like a triple double tonight`\kat is clutch as a motherfucker`\I've never seen somebody more out of control in a crucial moment than Westbrook on that last possession.`\its obvious they arent buying into his system. its all getting blown up soon anyways`\You can't give up 121pts as a team and have any reasonable expectation to win. How does anyone stop this train?`\I honestly think a Warrior loss helps you more. We can't have the Warriors going into the playoffs with 75 wins. They need at least a slight confidence shaker.`\Morris and Harris are looking good `\Made me check my channel to see if the game was on it.

It was. So, thanks for that.`\That is some piss-poor transition defense right there...`\and also a shooting drought`\I remember 2012? Westbrook taking a shot not even late in the shotclock from halfcourt.

Definitely a WTF shot from me`\That's such a meaningless statement.  The Thunder got beat because they couldn't outscore the Dubs--  the simple solution is that they just need to learn to "play offense."`\I hope not, but if he gets that in the next half he's got 22, so...`\Of course a Warriors supporter would think that
`\He seems pretty bright.`\And fouled him`\OKC's defense is reallly fucking lax. They're lucky GS aren't making their open 3's`\Warriors have won every game that Speights yammed a three.`\huh? wtf are you smoking? of the guys hitting the numbers he does he's probably the most unselfish player in the league. Even weirder to see a dubs fan saying something like this.`\DION WAITERS CRUNCH TIME`\lmao westbrook is crazy`\Not just a Warriors fan, fam.`\Ah fair, why'd you leave Blake out? Is this assuming a Blake/KD trade or something?`\Nah that user name is cool. The guy is just hurting. Melo fans want playoffs but they don't get none. Next year maybe tho `\Well our arena is sponsored by a bank which explains the debit cards. The weiners is probably explained by Usinger's being a big company in Milwaukee.`\You should get banned for this`\Hehe. This here is a dumb ass.`\I mean I got excited with the first half but let's be real. We all knew this was a Spurs loss. If it wasn't it would be scary.
`\You're kidding right? There is so much to feel bad about how we played tonight, just look at the box score and the 18 turnovers, 9 of them Westbrooks`\Is it just me or does Ibaka always fail at padding KD/Russ assist numbers late game. I swear he's cost KD like 5 triple doubles.`\HOLY SHIT DRAYMOND`\wtf i was doing homework, how did warriors catch up?`\It's Oakland man. You know how they get `\Of course Curry would end up only missing the most wide open 3 he's ever had lmao

Can I get that gif?`\goddammit kanter`\[Game in a nutshell.](http://i.imgur.com/M4YMzcx.png)`\All they had to do was shoot one lantern out`\He really looks like a low IQ guy out there, like he doesn't get the point of a proper pick`\Holy shit that pass`\11 years of no playoffs `\He`\Well this thread has died off, guess I'll talk to myself`\fuck steve blake, and thank you dion for long twos`\Oh I see. `\All I hear from OKC fans is "oh you are happy you won?".  No one is suggesting we are better, and if they are they're crazy.
`\You can't do anything about Harden hitting that 3. Just a great player hitting a great shot. `\California cantdor`\Kyle "Moses Malone" Singler`\Is Speights shooting the 3 better than Steph tonight?`\Inadvertent whistle. Oh, brother.`\55-5 wow`\Haha thanks man, glad I'm not the only one who sees the Samurai`\People talking about the clippers and how well they're playing without Blake, but they will not beat us without him. The defense has been so bad and the offense against our shit defense has been non existent. DJ is a non factor in this game too. `\this game is eerily similar to the game from 5 days ago`\I am saying it's crazy how if a clear foul happens the teams fans who committed the foul go CRAZY about a bad call, and the opposite team goes CRAZY about the foul

When the Wiz make obvious fouls I am pretty objective about it, I will never understand why teams fans get SO upset to the point of name calling etc when their team fucks up in even the smallest of ways`\Yup have work tomorrow morning but always try and watch a warriors game. It's just too exciting `\WHAT? I gave up on this like an hour ago. Holy.`\I'm saving that good D for your mom.

Maybe check my comment history. I rarely browsed this sub (people like you being the very reason) so I never bothered putting one up.

Pathetic attempt to distract from your weak ass argument sir?`\Oladipo is a starter, and Barton and Lin have fallen off.

prove us wrong OKC.`\did beverly and WB just peace shit up???`\Fire Donovan, just fire him. This lineup wasn't working and he decides to keep it the same in a close game. The fact he's kept Ibaka in is a joke.`\Fair point lol`\suck my dick our series against you got robbed by the refs bs call on Matt Barnes.`\When can you just grab the ball off the rim?`\Yeah draw the foul. I hate my life.`\That might finally kill Don Cherry`\Don't worry, it's an even year.  Which means the Cardinals will make it to the NLCS and lose to the Giants.`\1 more assist till triple double`\Well, I'll see you Thunder bros tomorrow against the Pacers`\So overrated`\I love how SVG gets demonstrably annoyed when his team makes a dumb play.`\Probably. But their iso basketball is easy to gameplan for in the playoffs. It's why we were able to beat them easily last year.`\TIL what Huestis looked like.`\Oh god. Your semen is probably motor oil.`\Does anyone think we can win the finals this year without Danny's offense? I actually don't think so. `\I have to admit that was a low quality half from both sides. By their standards anyway. The refs were low quality. As per their usual standards.`\I never thought it was awful. If we put him in the right lineup, I think he'd be okay. He never plays and he's shooting 40% from 3.`\They only have won like 25% of all the titles since the merger. I mean, wouldn't you be upset? `\Isnt that what they asked of him tho? They wanted him to turn like a stretch 4 so the paint can be clear for KD and Russ? I remember people mentioning that Ibaka needed to expand his game because both he and Perk clogged up the lane too much.`\y'all got to stop putting this on demar, at least hes putting points on the board. Lowry has been straight horseshit. And ross needs to man up and play, unless he broke his friggin thumb we have no offence of the bench w/o him`\Don't know, just know I'll be happy either way xD`\does kawhi never not look sad on the bench?`\He's definitely on or near the level of Tony "1st Team All-Defense" Allen. Allen will get lost and end up guarding no one every so often; KCP rarely, if ever, does. I truly believe he's on the cusp of becoming elite, just give him a few years.`\Yeah that is why you are also in the nba, you can shot just like Curry.`\We don't have our clutchest player so that might not happen. Hope it gets competitive though `\Of course.`\Lol, Andre from 14 feet.`\i have no one to kiss... : (`\I've been told they're the best in the league and aren't biased.`\Leave Durant alone, Kerr! `\goddamn I love it when Curry makes a mistake `\I saw he is like 5/38 in his career for game thing or go ahead shots in the last 10 seconds of a game. Dude is selfish at the end of the game. `\Thanks Oscar.

Seriously, I know these guys aren't the stat-nerdinest stat-geeks, but shit, do you really think the league just got a dose of idiot poisoning? Like, no team thought to themselves, "Hey, Curry shoots a lot of threes, why don't we play him really tight?".

IT DOESN'T WORK. EITHER YOU'RE DOUBLING AND HE THROWS IT TO THE OPEN MAN OR DRAYMOND/BOGUT AND THEY THROW IT TO THE OPEN MAN, OR HE GETS BY YOU AND MAKES A LAYUP.

We get nostalgia, but it's beyond stupid at this point. These teams are *better* than Chuck's Suns. They're better than Oscar's Bucks. The game has changed, dammit, and the players and defenses are better. If Oscar could suddenly be back in his prime and get on the court, he'd get his ass torched, because he never had to deal with guys like Durant or Curry or Lebron. `\back to the old defensive scheme, give them open looks for days and hope a rebound falls on your lap.`\The Oklahoma commercials? Oh yeah. `\God fucking dammit. Way to sour my mood for the half. I think being up in the second quarter and blowing the lead for the half is one of my 10 least favorite things in basketball...ugh.

Being down 2 isn't a huge deal, but come on...that last 7 minutes was fucking weak.`\Every time I see Rubio smile it just reminds me of that 'be happy, change your face' vid`\That's the joke. `\kd is also a beast though.`\can't get any open looks to go. doesn't seem to matter  for the thunder`\Football style chants only for "likeable" players.

<cries with AFC South banner>`\Westbrook makes some stupid decisions in crunch time. Its mind boggling`\BANG`\Save your money. I got golden state -20. `\Did you quote yourself`\We're up 17 and singler and Foye putting up -11 and -12 respectively`\Yeah, he's in shorts and everything, might be the first time this season. `\Nazr moving like he has glue on the shoes.`\Because Seattle `\Damn near went blind

It just makes things look awkward.`\He probably lives in San Antonio so...`\Dion Waiters and Draymond Green? Those 2 alone are good for 15 "And 1's", even when they don't attempt 15 shots.`\Durant is the better shooter, better defender, and more versatile scorer.

Additionally, his basketball IQ is higher and his game will age better.`\Thunder gunnin for that 4th spot.`\who are you kidding. `\I want to be a seventh seed just because it's a higher seed, bigger accomplishment, etc., but I'd rather play the Cavs. It's not like we could beat either you guys or the Cavs, so just want the best series and think we match up better with the Cavs. Also my roommate is from Cleveland and a big Cavs fan so it'd be more fun if I could talk trash to him.`\Both, one with 3 minutes to go to cut down on a 5 point Pistons lead, and one with 8 seconds left.`\ESPN SPENT ALL THEIR MONEY ON A RED LINE CANT SHOW REPLAYS SMFH`\The Tony from last season is coming back, can't play d can't do nothing on offense.`\What is speights 3pt percentage lol`\What the fuck OKC? `\https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cx1J2CzNnS8`\I'm not looking to argue. You disagree, so I said "feel free to argue.........". And you didn't. That's fine. `\we've had some insanely bad defensive possessions in this game.`\no one is a great kd defender`\What the fuck was that Westbrook, lmfao.`\So frustrating watching the Thunder. They keep calling timeouts, and then keep playing the same complacent defense. They all just look clueless out there, and the offense hasn't been much better. It looks like KD is pretty much boiling over with frustration.`\Well at least Foye has found his shot`\Ah that's cool`\I wonder how long we can dominate a team till we lose interest and crumble again. `\The refs are actually doing a pretty decent job this game. There's still a second half for them to fuck it up though.`\Well he sure is hell ain't coming home.

Usually around the 6 minute mark`\> oaklahoma`\Yikes`\Thunder look good when we have low turnovers and hit every shot. Who duh thunk it. `\hakeem? `\Why the fuck didn't KD or Westbrook take the shot...`\When a player gets at least 10 (double digits) of a certain category (points, steals, assists, rebounds, blocks) in any 3 of those categories. Example:

10+ points, 10+ rebounds, 10+ assists in 1 game. `\Lol wtf was that fucking play, Harden?`\And Westbrook is 5/19.
What's your point?`\Don't see why that's even relevant, this ain't the 1950's fam`\Aiming for the elusive quadruple double`\My fantasy team is waiting`\Has Westbrook reached that point where even when he is isn't the best player in the game, his name always gets mentioned in the post game headline when his team wins? `\Jeremy Lin`\Fuck harden`\That picture of Russ is terrifying.`\Mole Buckets`\Don't worry I'm enjoying it too.

Just set back and appreciate!`\lol damn it was like 4 point diff like 4 mins ago`\do they have to fire him?
 I think he is an assistant so they do not need to fire him.  Just keep him as an assistant.`\Warriors defense has been a mess for a lot of this quarter.`\Russell guarding JJ is helping. `\Terrible defensive rotations.`\so why doesn't draymond have at least one T by now`\Dude got hit in the head.

edit: nevermind [here it is](https://streamable.com/c0m9)`\Thunder starting to put it together it seems .`\We are about to fuck it up man`\KD you beast.`\https://i.ytimg.com/vi/oBuxmquP8tg/maxresdefault.jpg`\Dagger`\shaq makes shaun livingston randy`\Got caught up in the game. Haha. You can't blame me. My bad though. `\Thunder have to be the worst contender in terms of defense I have ever seen`\Why would you pull Enes? He at least played and earned to finish the game. God damnnit Donovan.`\SINGLER A FOOL. Seriously why is he taking so many shots`\If Ricky can, everybody can`\KD is in absolute god mode tonight, almost a perfect game.`\i dont get why tho. he has been at the biggest possible situations (the finals and playoffs) and he hit 3s then. `\God damn Russ`\how the fuck is there no defense there`\He is handsome?`\whatever happened to Mitch "literally Hakeem" McGary anyway`\KD has been taking some poor shots lately. He hasn't had any *awful* shooting nights, but I feel like he can take better (and easier) shots than he usually does. `\Come on, Ibaka...`\It physically pains me to watch LaVine play d sometimes`\but have you heard about our lord and savior Mchale`\WTF Westbrook`\Durant said he's doing this thing alone`\lol so open he waited for someone to come at him`\CHOKC`\what the fuck was that Westbrook? `\That was the Reggie I know and love.

;_;`\212 probably `\I don't really like Cousins, but I hope he's okay.`\Splash Cousin!`\I don't agree.  It was statistically great (minus TOs), and super efficient, but he needed to take the bad shots when OKC's offense stalled.  Westbrook was having an awful night.  `\Thunder in a pick em shut it off after the third got damn I hate gambling `\wow if they keep playing like that i dont mind playing OKC in the second round.. `\I wish Donovan still did that thing where Durant and Westbrook are both on the bench.`\When Roberson is making his 3's and our bigs aren't fumbling passes, things just aren't going our opponents' way. The regression surely approaches, though. `\Sometimes you^just^need^a^good^fucking`\Probably a set play, not the best lob and not the best catch plus it was well defended.`\Does Billy always do this? The tide had turned a moment ago. Kanter was going alpha sky hook against a clearly tired David West and Coach Billy fucking opted to not call a time out and just the most cliche reliance of isos. What the fuck. `\We're so fucking capable of doing this every night. It's so frustrating that we keep beating ourselves `\Yeah definitely don't think I've ever heard that. `\He's too young`\[Singler block](https://streamable.com/6yal)`\I'm having flashbacks from last year..`\Okay.... These soft calls can stop now`\You always want one of either Westbrook or KD on the floor. That's Billy D's strategy`\Do GSW fans really think he'd come? I mean he may well leave OKC, but I bet Golden State is towards the bottom of his list. That's a legacy killer for him. `\Russel westbrook? `\It's going to be a pit of despair and self-loathing as we complain about Crowder's injury, Tyler Zeller, Marcus Smart's offense, our tough schedule, etc.`\Will Pop sub in Timmy and Tony? so far Mills + West are terrific.`\And the block on Russ was clean. `\My god Kanter has great hands.`\We are playing some of the best basketball of our entire season tonight. We look amazing. Best we've looked all season. `\dudes gotta have the best hands of all time`\what the flying fuck`\Westbrook, smfh, why do you shoot that ?`\I think this tweet sums it up :)

https://twitter.com/netw3rk/status/705633351860785152`\A Habs player fell head on ice after getting punched and missed a chunk of the season because of a concussion a few years ago. (Moen maybe?).

If you take out fighting, you take out an unnecessary risk of injury. Hockey fans evolved from Neanderthal rednecks liking hockey for fistfights.

That said... I sure miss Lyle Odelein.

`\I'm finna do my taxes during this game. Grown up shit going down on a Friday.

I have no idea what I'm doing how do I get all the moneys?`\wish we had tross out there`\Dude threw Kanter to the ground. No foul. Okay. Thunder bigs getting wrecked and refs just ignoring it`\Well that was unexpected.`\Foul on Tilda Swinton.`\Wow impressive sequences from Singler.`\You can't look at the fouls and tell me they weren't all legit`\Yikes`\okc pulled an arsenal`\LMA showin up tonight!! Been waiting for him to make his mark in a big game for so long. Great to see.`\7th SPOT AND 40 WINS BABY!!!`\so many open 3s. can we hit like half of one. `\You're fast!`\least valuable point guard? he is an unbelievable point guard who can't shoot... til that shot... lol`\Russ is gonna fuck around and drop 20 dimes`\I just want an injury free game pls `\Westbrook has officially fallen in love with the Eurostep, I love it. Also nice to see Durant giving an ear to Donovan.`\It's indicative of the Thunder getting a lot of free throws.

If you're watching the game, maybe you feel a way about some of those calls. Maybe you don't.

Personally, I can't see much difference between the Warriors' drives and the Thunder's, except that the Warriors are making their shots and the Thunder are getting FTs out of them.`\I love Livingston.`\lol true`\what?`\It's sad how true this is`\Norm is the best 2nd rounder ever`\we have no idea how to defend the 3.`\You  can't explain that `\https://streamable.com/oncn`\dude ive never seen fans having a better time than these ones. everyone looks like theyre having the time of their lives`\Russ might be hurt more than we think`\Russell "Jamal Crawford" Westbrook`\why is KD dribbling so loose`\lmao some Warrior's stream started playing lil b `\Imagine if you had two of top players in the league on one team, but they were mis-managed...`\You said worst in the league. I'd say we're more on the lower end of mediocre. `\Damn man Aldridge has come up big in this game.
`\Crawford is like a worse version of Dion`\Curry effect right there. Westbrook wasted too much time since he was worried about a possible halfcourt heave`\oh god no

edit: just a hip`\ARE YOU FUCKING KIDDING ME `\Was*`\i think youre onto something.BLOW EM UP`\Foye is so garbage `\oh no the A team isn't here

i like Shaq and all but it's just not the same...`\oh fuck`\I am pleasantly surprised we made of game of it in the 4th after being absolutely butchered in the 3rd quarter. Kanter again delivering in the 4th quarter.

Too bad WB had a shitty shooting game, if he was on song we would have won.

Singler continues to be the worst player to grace the floor. For some reason he was a starter today but donovan had to yank him every time, only got 18 minutes.

Overall not too unhappy given who we were resting. This game is unlikely to have any playoff implications for us, we only need to win 2/3 more to cement the 3rd seed, even if the clips win out. `\Hurray, Singler hasn't been total ass so far`\Very, very important. He may be the closest thing to a 2 way player we have. The other guys are all specialized in some form or another. `\I noticed that too. He must be tired af`\Too much water`\Waiters and Westbrook both have this weird ability to make ridiculous, no-chance 3 pointers, despite being pretty mediocre 3 point shooters overall. `\god damn livingston `\Not this bad, no.`\our 6th man, playing less minutes than our 9th man. smh`\I can't take this anymore. This isn't the team I loved...`\Jordan & pippen signed a ten day contract to protect their record`\Nah, Steve is a stupid name.

Oh wait, my coach is named Steve...`\Every time serge turns it over from a Westbrook pass = :'( `\Watch now Towns won't play the rest of the game lolololol`\Mark Jackson thinks people don't think Aldridge is a good player.. ok.`\I think we have enough to build a house`\Serge has stone hands`\theyre hot`\"We need a stop" thanks, magic.`\westbrook lol`\I hit live, and it turns out I was a little behind. I don't remember pausing or rewinding, though. Weird`\i told ya'll Singler would dominate. /s`\stop trying to draw fouls. just make a play and score`\Thank fuck, first time I've seen refs fuck up badly and then fix it up`\Do you believe that?`\Here se go. Hope is not a blow out from the start.

At the same time i think GSW is risking it playing the two potentially enjury players.`\Tatsunoko baby `\I know right, a more realistic estimate is the jazz by 45`\Great you compared 3 players that aren't similar at all. What about everything else?`\Things I thought were gif-worthy

He is worthless in crunch time. `\I think Westbrook will end up in L.A?`\He was pretty good on Saturday.`\He must be a righteous dude. `\Hmmmm if you click the #2 post on the the top team subreddit posts you'll find something different. We know it's a pipe dream.`\At least your not a nets fan`\Yeah we've been in a slump from the 3 for about a week now. Very frustrating.`\Hey man, no one could have beaten Brandon "the Titan Slayer" Weeden. No one.`\It's weird seeing Mo Speights get points.  When the Raps played the Dubs seeing Mo on the floor basically meant "ok time to get back in this game."`\Iblocka`\since there's only 41 games a year, there's no way it's their only job though`\I've watched four basketball games in the last four days.

1. Oklahoma up 7 on Texas with 7 to play, loses by 13.

2. Thunder up 4 on Golden State with 14 seconds to play, lose in OT.

3. Oklahoma up 26 on Baylor in the first half, Baylor takes the lead with 4 minutes to play. But Oklahoma pulls it out.

4. This game. Thunder were up 18 when I turned it on.

I think I'm just going to quit watching basketball.`\That Westbrook 3 tho`\Yeah its concerning, but I'm going to be optimistic. Hopefully this lights a flame under this team to keep playing hard the whole game we had a really good 1st half and from there let them come right back into it. That can't happen, someone has to light a fire under everyone we got away from what was working in the first half. `\Crying is a typical side effect of the famous Westbrook last ditch effort, off balance 3s (with more than 6 seconds on clock). `\Man I hate Waiter's game`\Superman could throw the ball to a rim around Saturn, let the ball come back and Kanter would be the one to rebound it. That fucking guy man. So good at the boards. `\You still has an outside chance for the one seed. That is most likely gone now. `\Ros on TNT pls`\We have to be saving Payne vs Warriors for the playoffs right? Does Donovan think hes some kinda Curry stopper? `\Lmao speights missing dunk brings back memories`\gtfo`\...do you even watch hockey?  It's not like basketball where one player can carry a team.  Saying he improves their chances tenfold is ridiculous.`\What is defense?`\I hate the supersonics the most. Their fans weren't even fans until OKC took their team. They couldn't fill the seats and then all of a sudden all of Seattle are fans and we've personally all ruined their lives. `\Good thing I didn't take that bet, I don't have 72 cents...`\AND-1 again!`\Have you ever had Mexican food from san antonio? Its fucking delicious `\They're so fucking good, it's unbelievable.`\\o`\New Zealander vs aussie. Super interesting. And shows how far basketball has come when the starting center for maybe the 2 best teams in the world are international dudes `\Can't they just like, find other jobs then?`\I dont get why they give a super established actor like Ashton Kutcher that role... did he really add any value to the commercial or company? Why couldn't a struggling actor make a little cash in a gig like that`\I'm 22 and I'm going to have heart problems just from the last 5 or 6 days.`\And the meltdown begins`\Sorry, you must be confused.

Slowly becoming pretty solid for us.`\Hey it me, KD`\I wonder what his reddit name is`\Late whistles can suck my dick.

It was still a foul, but call it or don't call it, don't wait to see if he makes it.`\Those things are related`\Give me the Thunder in the 2nd round. Holy shit so ass`\Eventually these open 3's will start falling in.....right guys?`\Right, the guy who drafted KD, Westbrook, Ibaka, Adams, Harden should be fired. What an awful guy. `\hb sucks`\Sad interpretive dance to Midnight Sonota.`\He's moving a lot out there at least. I mean, just look at that screen on Barbosa.`\Only because he was being guarded by the worst choker in the league that was at that time having the one of the worst collapses in playoffs history.`\OKC gave up about 5 minutes ago, just going through the motions now.`\Yeah, that was all me. You got anything else to stutter, fuck wit?`\Hahaha this is actually what came up first in my head when I went to comment.`\Slim Reaper showing up early, good game`\Everything was fine until the salt about the officiating lol`\Foye happened. Apparently he's our backup PG now.`\It's been fine, just getting beat on back cuts. Draymond and several others have been blocked/challenged`\Even though someone else already corrected you I will too. /r/NBA Epiphany*`\I feel sad about my teams (mets, Knicks,) but then I remember Eli Manning and the legend of 18-1.`\I think you and me are the only people in this thread `\Yeah...Thunder shooting 41%, Spurs shooting 36%...`\gg`\this fight for the 6, 7, 8th seed is going to be very interesting.

I concede, you were right. `\Yes, Brad. Fourth quarter execution is coachable. It is either the coaches fault for not engineering an effective scheme and out of time-out plays, or its the coach's fault because the stars are ignoring that scheme to hunt for their shot.

Obviously, a coach isn't out their actually executing and you need players to step up and run those schemes, but in this case the talent appears to be there. `\I see. I guess I only watch national games lol. `\Waiters is red hot.`\Collison would help this team by retiring as far as I'm concerned `\It's almost disappointing that Curry chose this year to go absolutely nuts, because what Westbrook has been doing this season is unbelievable. He'd be the MVP in a lot of other years.`\Bogut's just trying to give a foul and stop the fast break but it would sure be a cleaner play if he grabbed him instead. Shoving a dude in the back is a bit dangerous.`\LOL someone is downvoting Thunder fans`\I'm not understanding this comment. Help me out.`\I mean... *We* lost to the Lakers. Getting outplayed happens.`\WHAT THE FUCK OKC WENT FULL RETARDED IN THE LAST 2 MINUTES `\Westbrook is panicking. He always chucks threes in situations like this. He needs to stop. `\yo it def looked like KD got fouled there, wish TNT would show a replay`\https://streamable.com/q4op`\He was ok, but it's really getting out of hand now. Someone needs to tell him.

As Bogut set a shitty pick, he just grabbed and pulled on the front waistband of Ibaka's shorts and held it.

Then he falls back into the key and pulls on Adams' arm to keep him from defending on Curry's drive, and then shoves Adams away from a jumping/shooting Curry`\Suckbrook`\he has been for the most part. the problem is, when he has games like this, he doesn't take any responsibility. so then it keeps happening. he's been doing this for years, but people write it off as taking the good with the bad. no, stop jacking up three pointers, that's not your game. how does he not get it yet?`\He made some shots, ones that looked good for him.

So it'd probably have to be one where he played amazing but the game was still close. So yeah, the Thunder game last Saturday was definitely up there. It was certainly the most exciting to watch.

I want to know if he is coachable.

I want to preface this with, I have no idea and this is **WILD SPECULATION**.

* But part of me wonders if the reason the offenses in OKC are so ISO heavy and stagnant is if that because of Russ seizing the wheel. Like does Billy want to do things differently, but he cant because Westbrook dictates the action?
* Westbrook strikes me, again **WILD SPECULATION**, as a hyper aggressive, stubborn, and quick tempered star who is likely the one really running the show in OKC.

I love watching him play when he is on, and I think the Russ / KD PnR is likely the most deadly play in the NBA, but it feels like something else is going on here. `\This new method of not choking is kind of awesome `\Would KD and Kentucky be better than OKC's lineup?`\I really hope he wins 6MOTY`\Plus it's not like anybody else on okc is worth a damn besides those 2`\What the fuck OKC`\Warrrrrriiiiiioooooorrrrrrsssss!!!!!!`\Now they have to play the Warriors tomorrow night after playing Durant+WB for 40mins each.

And those 3 actually fit together really well -- it's the other 2 positions, the PG and the C, that were having trouble fitting in.  There's a reason they've been much better with the OJ Mayo/Miles Plumlee lineup, beating Houston tonight.`\They didn't mess around with Curry from that deep lol. Good defensive recognition.`\Man fans in this thread went from "holy shit OKC is so good!" to "lol fuck OKC" real fucking quick`\#AUSTIN RIVERS IS THE KEY`\All we have to do is hope we keep it close til the fourth quarter.`\Hi guys!`\The worst part is that they came out flying in the third with motion and multiple passes, which led to easier looks, but as soon as it got tight they went back to ISO. `\thin krisps`\Reggie was never gang gang gang gang, he was never one of us`\Good job falling on your face for the foul `\Stop.asking.this.fucking.question.`\We've been to the finals. That's literally more in one playoff run than all of your playoff series wins combined.

If you're saying that then you must agree with me-I don't claim the Sonics championship.`\God watching Varejao on the Dubs breaks my heart...he had stuff in the tank to contribute with us, but I'm glad you're treating him well... If we'd have traded him to the nets, for JJ, as was rumored before...id hate it... I'm happy he's on a winning team. I hope you love him like we loved him, warriors fans...he's such a consummate professional and a great teammate. `\I agree with your sentiment, but it's not the same in other sports. No other sport encouraged straight beating another player. Sure, if you fucked with Isaiah, then Lambeir might foul fuck out of you, but in the NHL it was like an unspoken rule to not hit certain players because they'd bring out a 6'6'' motherfucker who can't play for shit and is only on the team because he is 240lbs and knows how to fight on skates.

It was basically it's own little game within the game. It'd be like if an NBA team signed Fedor and were like ehhh....go fuckup Lebron if he fouls Westbrook to hard vs. now it's like okay someone like Perkins might body the fuck out you for a few plays. They aren't out there to actively hurt anyone, it's more of a just don't check the shit out of our point guard.


People definitely did get hurt though. There have been a lot of players with severe facial fractures and /or careers ended because of hockey fights. I mentioned Twist in my OP, and that dude has done a few on his own, and he wasn't even the biggest or shortest live most brutal goons. When he fought Rob Ray his face was basically hanging on by it's skin.

Westbrook is arguably the best PG in the league. He's an *amazing* passer (leads in assists or 2nd to Rondo), *amazing* rebounder (best rebounding PG if not mistaken), and our offense completely goes through him every play.

Thing is, KD is a similar package in the 3. They both "have it all". Take away a bit in the passing stat, put it in shooting and there you have him. Oh, and in a 7 foot body. They're great individual players, yes. But to imagine them apart is not what you want because they're an even better combo. They are the best 1-2 punch in the game. It's what we have and we're damn lucky for it. They make each other even better. Sorry for the crappy fans. We don't like to choose`\[He's been at it for a while](https://www.instagram.com/amazingsladek/)`\Tomorrow's game is gonna be so  hyped`\Goddam Marv Albert just slurps GSW the entire broadcast.  `\This is an off night for Curry `\Get out of here with that shit.

It's like Rondo (or I guess boston Rondo), it's a huge weakness keeping them from being a top 2/3 PG in the league and it's super obvious so you know they must have been working on it their entire time as a pro (much like Dwight FT) but it's just not happening.

Anyway
#Thunder Up!
`\wtf is up with the empty seats? just late back from halftime?`\Oh shit, I didn't know Mo was back`\shh bb is ok`\just watched it again a few times. james definitely was late and behind on it. if he throws it a step earlier and in front of dwight it's a dunk.`\Same. `\Not at all`\We know. We've always known.`\Boo hoo do something in the playoffs and people will respect you.`\KD would be so much better playing with Wall or Rondo as a pg, never gonna get it done with Westbrook.`\HOVAAAAAAAAAAAAAA`\Not even salty this time. We deserved to lose this one.

Way too many turnovers and losing our defenders off-ball. GG Warriors`\He looks way younger`\David Blatt played with a team that had Lebron, Kyrie, Love, a decent supporting cast in Shumpert, Smith, Thompson, Mozgov, etc, not to mention his abundance of experience in international competition. If Cleveland hadnt somehow gotten 3 #1 picks in 4 years, he would have never made the Finals.

Kerr has the single most dominant scorer currently in Curry, a #2 that could be a #1 on most teams, a 4 that can guard all 5 positions, a sixth man that could be a #1 on a decent amount of teams, and an excellent supporting cast, not to the fact that he completely lucked into the lineup that won them the Championship. He also has a crap ton of Nba experience, having been under Pop and Phil, 2 HOF locks.

Neither of them are from collegiate level like Donovan or Hoiberg are, not to mention that a lot of luck helped them make it so far. `\you guys were up 7...`\Grindfest. Like Destiny if you enjoy that sort of thing.`\probably bought them.`\It's your fault then.`\Holy shit, Bucks. What's going on?`\[The best rebounding guard to the fastest gun in the west](https://streamable.com/ty7x)`\Good god ref let people go for rebounds. `\Thats one of the worst 1st quarter stat lines I have ever seen`\Anyone can throw gumballs at a hungry hungry hippo.

No j/k, I'm with you.`\Welcome fam`\Ou won by like 20. Headed to elite 8`\Westbrook holy shit`\As someone with the most amateur of amateur reffing experience, this was frequently the case.`\uh oh...`\Not a problem, glad to have another Spurs fan!`\Wish this collapse happened before the trade deadline. `\Ya two timeouts is nothing to scoff at, but NBA teams are given a ton of timeouts to start the game.

I guess I just didn't like that they got to avoid the 8 second rule after the Rockets had defended well for 6 seconds. Then they denied the inbounds well and OKC was able to get out of it by using a timeout. Normally, the advancement takes place before the defending team has started playing defense. I was surprised that this was how the rule worked. I assumed after they didn't get advancement after their first timeout that the second one wouldn't advance them.

With that said it was a minor thing and the Beverly foul was really foolish. Just bothered me a little bit when I was watching live. `\Anyone else notice Boogie was wearing Barkley's? Pretty ironic haha`\Thibs. `\What i said was salty? Man you should hear some other shit people say about him, all I said was he had a bad game - which in entirely true.`\Mike Miller exclusive.`\lol`\39 and 37? Still a ton of minutes for a back to back to lose the first game...`\Slim reaping`\Even the godamn nose bleeds could hear that slap`\Let's have a good civil game thread tonight. I know national TV game threads can be shit but let's all get along tonight and just down vote the trolls. `\Yeah age is what I'm thinking will hold him back. What a stud though. `\false`\Well when teams collapse on him when he drives he's supposed to dish it.

The play where Marv made that comment had 4 Thunder players surrounding him. `\He wants to roast Russell with a sonics flair.`\Damn those Detroit cheerleaders are fine.`\What `\Their skin colour has nothing to do with it. Dont know why you would think that.
Its more they are both leaders who throw negative blanket statements over a whole group of people.

Vote for anyone other than Trump, they couldnt possibly be worse.
Liar? Check.
Racist? Check.
Idiot? Check.

Hasnt he filed for bankruptcy like 4 times?`\This is beautiful basketball `\It's happened more than a handful of times, warriors twice, trailblazers, Miami, clippers, etc. I think we have the most losses by single digits or something too.`\lol damn i see you on here during every thunder game, you are always on point with the comments sir`\6-19, 2-7 from three vs 9-15, 1-3 from 3

Which one is Westbrook and which is Durant lol`\Recently yes × 100`\You have the foul called on Adams in the final minute that pretty much changed the game? I think it was called as a moving screen when he had the ball and Russ was running by. `\BEASTBROOK`\That would be really relevant it if was two years ago. `\I don't care if you claim it or not. Fact is your team started off as the Sonics. Do all the mental gymnastics you want, you literally cannot dispute that. And going to the Finals means nothing. Ask the Jazz.`\If there is any weight to the free agency talk, you might already have that. `\Wtf was that, Westbrook?! You had a decent chance at a layup`\That asian kid at the clippers game, with a Kobe Jersey, wearing a Detroit Lions hat. Confused. `\he tried to get that  bailout foul from CP3 again like a few years ago`\Come on man, we can't be saying that to ANYONE.`\Slim Reaper just Slim Reaping`\B.

Does some weird stuff and doesn't control the team great. But overall okay.`\Westbrook gets the call before he even puts up the shot`\Long as we don't get out-rebounded by more than 30, I think we will be OK!`\holy shit, these calls `\Jordan has come up huge down the stretch.`\Good, I love seeing KD play well.`\That and-1 putback had me hype`\What do Houston fans think of Beasley so far?`\Fuck off refs, not every bit of contact is a fucking foul!`\why do the thunder look so...off`\You're right, this guy's opinion doesn't exactly match that of the Raptors fanbase. `\Never try to tell me Russ is better than Durant again `\Yes but i wanna see the healthly in playoff hope that dont tax them in that part of the season. `\fucking curry man`\Buzzers scare him?`\Touchdown!!!`\Oklahoma working in an offense. It's a miracle.`\MINI RUN`\100% agree.`\Dwight needs his PEDs and stickum back. `\Maybe his breath smells really nice`\LMAO Clipppers pulling the anti clipper`\Very good point. I had literally never thought about the matter that way before.`\Even on the pass, Harden has to head flop`\Do you think the refs whistles aren't working? I haven't heard it blown much tonight`\Russ without KD gets kinda sloppy :/ `\K`\they are with kd and ibaka out lol`\Just checking in. Did anyone on either side sink a three other than Kmart?

EDIT: what the fuck? Downvotes?`\haha I less than three you too`\Man if we don't at least have a, like, 5 point lead by the half, we are gonna be dead `\Dion "AND ONE" Waiters`\:)`\NaCl `\Adams joked about Howard's FTs, and now Howard is making us pay`\People don't complain about Curry isos, it's ironic.`\Wtf Singler. `\boooooooooooooooooooooooooooo`\this will forever be known as the 35 REVERSE game`\We got out to a big lead and it seems like we decided to stop playing defense `\COJO `\Stan Mad Gundy`\lil pik n' pahp n' pik n' ro`\[KD feeds Adams](https://streamable.com/gefl)`\People have the memory of a goldfish. OKC was at the line for the first 36 minutes`\Some fans freak out but forget we've been among the top of the west for 5 years now. Missing the conference finals once in our playoff runs when Westbrook got hurt in the first round in 2013 (we got into the 2nd round then lost). Very few teams can say that.

Fuck you Beverley.

How did you not know this'd be the answer? Every Thunder fan who watched the playoffs knows we fucking hate the Rockets.`\Feel like the Thunder got away with more in the paint in that quarter.`\I missed the last game, not this time.`\Wait, what? Am I behind in the game or something?`\I feel like you can't do that during the regular season but for sure in the playoffs`\So it's the clippers obligation to pay more than they have to? They're a business not a charity. Going by what you're saying they should just double every stadium employee's pay while they're at it`\Doesn't really matter. Memphis is going to get shit on.`\If Russ can just score 3 points we will win. Based on the fact were undefeated when his has a triple double. `\top 5 players DNP, eh`\NO. NO INJURIES ON DURANT.

Ive been saying he should close games. `\KAT is niceee`\DO WE HAVE A CHANCE?????`\OKC needs to place all defensive stud role players around KD and Westbrook. Its their D that holds the team back`\And that's why the Thunder always fuck up close games.`\He's probably resting for a min or two`\Seriously though. The guy threw it farther than Brandon Weeden did all season.`\We're god damn lucky to have him as part of our fanbase.`\I miss his goofy rookie social media presence, he was funny back in the day`\i just switched to this game and at a glance i looked at Stanley Johnson thinking wtf was Ben Wallace doing on the court.`\[KD cross and driving dunk](https://streamable.com/u7kl)`\¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯`\looked like goaltending`\do you think you are owed something?`\I'm embarrassed for my team. `\I miss Scott Brooks for the sole reason of how much I love this meme`\GO EH-TUNDER GO`\42-12 when out rebounding opponent. The most amazing part about that stat is that we've out rebounded in 54 of our games. `\I think that was the absolute worst game all season.

This is ridiculous, apparently you aren't allowed to contest him?`\Get a sense of humor, bruh`\Hate it then too. `\DAMN.. that pass by Livingston.`\Steph still gonna nail a dagger from half court`\dion waiters chucking bricks.`\>Not sure how you can watch these past 3 games and think Okc can win.

How can you not? The dubs were lucky to win the game on Saturday. They needed a lucky 3 by Klay, a lucky trap, a lucky no time out call, a lucky bad pass, a lucky tip by Klay, a lucky save by dray, a lucky foul call, a lucky iggy making lucky free throws, and then a luck as hell three by Steph (obviously not all luck, but hopefully you get my point).. the dubs should have lost saturday..

and then last night okc dominated/led for 3 quarters.. but the dubs bench took control in the 4th and okc reverted to hero ball... oh and the thunder were playing on the 2nd night of a back to back...

Then in the first game they played the game was tied with 3 mins to go in the fourth..

okc can definitely beat the dubs. Once playoff time comes.. and the benches get shorter.. and there are less fast court plays and more half court play... okc can win. they have 2 of the top 5 players in the league.. the dubs have no one to stop Durant when he gets going.. the dubs have no one to stop westbrook when he gets going.. those two guys alone can win 2 games for them..

meanwhile the spurs.. got blown out by 30.. it was not even close ever.. although we'll have to wait and see of course.. the spurs don't have a mosgof (whose height and athleticsm really caused problems) and they dont have a lebron.. if they play ginobli and parker they will lose by 30 every game.. aldridge isnt physical.. duncan isn't physical... it will be interesting to see but all in all I still think OKC has a much better shot at knocking the dubs off then the spurs do.`\Does Michael Cage ever shut the fuck up`\He just seems to suck in all the loose balls, it's insane`\The pace of this game is approaching insanity.`\If you're terrible you should at least be 6'8 and terrible `\how did he post that before it happened?

CJ Illuminati confirmed `\Lol are we really going to lose another 4th quarter. Really, guys? `\Who is complaining?`\These teams cannot stop each other. This is pretty fun to watch`\Where is Kanter?`\that clutch 3 at the end of G5 was nuts`\Welp, time to turn off the game after that shot`\I'm from the West coast and am honeymooning in the East coast this weekend. It's 1am and my wife has been asleep for an hour already but I stayed up. Worth it! I don't know how you guys do this on the east coast. I would constantly be late to work from watching dubs games on weeknights.`\But the 7/8 seed scramble will be so fun to watch`\But come Thursday, we'll be back to hating you and yall hating enes Lmao, I say we drop that game just to stick it to Houston `\Is it me or are the colors/glare off on the ESPN cameras?`\They're shooting FTs on like every possession of the 3rd quarter

Lets break down his sentence "That would be really relevant if it was two years ago"

Hes implying that if it was in fact 2 years ago, then it is relevant. If he had said, "if it wasn't" then we have another claim. `\Iggy with the flop`\I think we have a big enough sample to say that OKC can be competitive with Golden State in a series. The difference IMO is that OKC can't blow out Golden State and get an easy win due to being a 2 man team. Golden State on the other hand can get hot as a team go 20-35 from 3 and just shoot OKC out of the building. That 1 blowout would make a huge difference in a highly contested 6 or 7 game series.`\Both free throws looked clean too, bottom of the net both times.`\The games not for 3 hours...`\Per Royce, 14 triple doubles most in last 25 years`\FREE CAMERON PAYNE`\they are going to foul Adams out, how many fouls is that?`\http://insider.espn.go.com/nba/hollinger/statistics/_/order/false`\[Nick 'backdoor pass' Collison to KD](https://streamable.com/il8m)`\Him trying those 'weird' lineups is him adjusting to situations.. since that 'weird' lineup we've blown out the Kings.

Payne has had tonnes of good minutes and he'll get more if we build good leads but the decision has obviously been made that he's not ready yet and that's fine, the offense often stalled badly when he got on and we were often poor defensively when lineups with Payne and Morrow were on the floor.

We've got offense to burn, second most points per game in the league. What we need is to tighten up the defensive end, especially going in to the playoffs.`\Klay ups be gone!`\Can we please get 7 games of westbrook and curry head to head`\Does Billy Donovan actually do anything coach-like?

His good games are just a bonus for us.  I don't care if it happens every other game someone else usually steps up if he flops.

And I get why he wanted to leave, he deserved a starting spot and I'm happy he's doing well in it, but he could never have thrived next to Russ.

My only issue with him is how he acted when we had about 7 active players at the start of last season, and he was our only remaining ball handler. Instead of taking the opportunity to run offense (even with lesser talent around him) and flash his abilities as a lead guard, he instead monopolized the ball and only looked for his own shot. This lead to Serge and Perk freezing him out in game, and remember, he was the only healthy man on the roster who could dribble at this point. That could've been a great opportunity for him to try and carry the team and prove himself a star, instead he was just hunting his own buckets.

When shaq left Kobe did carry that team alone. Hell that was a 10 win team without Kobe Bryant


As for Leanord what are you basing that off of? Defensively he's an absolute nightmare and a solid offensive option but most of his shots are wide open and he has never had to be a primary shot creator. Right up there with Paul George for best two way player in the game (and after this year he will edge him out until pg can be more consistent) but we have never seen him on a team with no other offensive players or as a primary scoring option that must create his own looks. If he still manages to keep up this level of play  when the team starts to retool with the Parker/manu/Duncan retirement then that will be a very strong case for him


You're entitled to your opinions but curry doesn't have a career of carrying weak teams or anything that leads one to believe he is the best player in the nba. Best shooter ever? Yes. Best player on the best team? Yes. Best out right player in the nba? No quite. Hell its not even like he is irreplaceable on the Warriors, replace him with any of the other top 3 guards and the team is still the best team in the nba and their defense gets even better. Cp3 or Westbrook would both thrive on that team. But take last year for example, if you were to place curry on that rockets team do they still make the wcf?

I miss those half time shows too ): `\A lot of replies pointing out the difference in ball then and now. I think there was expansion teams that year too, which should be easy wins  Diminishing 72-10 is outright silly though, it's an incredible feat, but the Warriors level of competition this year is crazy.  Every team plays their heart out and we're three quarter of the season and there is only five losses. Two if you only count a fully healthy team. That is unbelievable. `\Fuck Waiters....`\The time you spent writing this comment could have been spent just clicking the link.

Now the Cav's did remake themselves into a defensive oriented team in the playoffs, I just don't think the Warrior's struggles early were all due to good defense (after all when's the last time Steph air balled a shot like he did to win G2?).`\Glad Durant is able to play tonight, if not we'd probably be starting Morrow.`\4TH QUARTER RUSS IS HERE`\Ayy Lmao`\Messing with a dudes legs / feet while he is trying to move is serious.`\Lol Westbrook was about to swing it to the corner that had no one there.

Maybe he thoughh he might as well try it.`\Refs are all over `\So hyped on him right now `\Neither does the bench...`\Westbrook. The chaos that he generates on the floor doing crazy honey badger things allows everyone to attack as the defense has to worry about raw athleticism dominating them. Even Durant has decided to play off of it this year, in my opinion.`\You awesome`\JVG: "but what happened at the barbershop??" lmao`\Wow, Durant is really choking...`\Roaracle lol`\They are playing with much more mental toughness down the stretch. They seem to have crested the "choke away a game late" hill they've been caught on for the last year.`\Lol we were playing hilariously lazy on offense.  Pistons started the third playing good D and we just gave up even trying to run action.`\Fuck yeah!`\Cousins wants a tech so bad `\lol almost every single Spurs fans knows that Danny needs to hit 3s for them to beat elite teams. Please don't pat yourself on the back for that theory. Danny gets minutes because he plays elite defense and he has the potential to get hot from outside. That's why Spurs fans defend him and why Pop continues to play him because the alternative is 39yo Manu, a rookie Simmons, or zero defense KMart.`\Are there black people in Plano or Frisco? Dallas has all their minorities segregated and acts like theyre so cultured.`\Our bench is poorly balanced. We have too many players who are one dimensional and are only good on one side of the floor.

I feel Ibaka hasn't really progressed as a player and has probably taken a backwards step due to all his injury problems.

I'm pretty sure it's Tucker in 17 - Russ in 20 - Russ in 22 - Jordan in 22/3-  - Russ in 24 just now


The actual time of the Jordan one is disputed though, could be third or fourth. Anything after two can't really be officially placed. We just know Tucker is fastest and Westbrook is second`\Yeah he took great shots tonight other than one random 3, but that's not a big deal. He's so much better when he's driving into the lane constantly. He settled for a lot of jumpers against GSW`\<3`\singler proving he's worthy of a max deal`\What position does Huestis play?

Also, someone has replaced his hands with frying pans.

Edit: I should be more precise. It honestly looks like lack of effort on defense. On offense his shot is off.

Defend it all you want, they have lost 5 of the last 7 (and after tomorrow probably 6 of 8)

With Russ and KD they are always a threat, but they have got to pull it together soon or they will get an early 2nd round match up with the Warriors. `\Finally, it took you this long to decide to make a sub.....fucking hell`\The Thunders offense is too one-dimensional (well, even worse than it was before) without Durant.

Nice. `\KD LET'S GO `\Hey that Kevin Durant guy is pretty good. `\Nah i know for sure he came back up and guarded Klay.`\And if they make the finals they're guaranteed home court advantage do long as they don't lose the rest of their games.

There's nowhere he can go that would be better for him.

The Wizards aren't good enough to justify him going home. GSW would be an instant championship, but he'd be playing second fiddle to Curry.

Where else would he go? `\YOU GET A WHISTLE AND YOU GET A WHISTLE AND YOU GET A WHISTLE`\It really is the cavs vs the west.

Lol`\It's crazy because this game somehow showed how both teams involved aren't serious title contenders.`\They moved two years after I was born and my first memory of them was watching the super bowl with my dad and him going crazy when they won. They're the only football team I've ever loved and when people asked my why I supported them, I told them because they will always be the LA Rams at heart. Now that they are again, it's kind of surreal to me. I got a lot of shit because of how bad they have been and I still supported them through it all. Now I get to go watch them play when I come home for Christmas. `\And Rivers actually did a pretty good job on Durant in the 4th.

We're about to drop to 4th seed by the way. I dont remember the exact stats, but IIRC we were up 3 games on the CLips today, so we just went down 2, and will lose tomorrow, which will even it up. So if the Clips win their next game, IIRC, we drop to 4th seed. `\Kevin Durant going for that quadruple double already at 29pts/10rebs/9asts/9tos.

OKC lost tonight defintiely due to the second night of a back to back. They just didn't have that extra gear tonight.

The first 2 games between them were extremely close and the thunder had the second in the bag if not for an embarrassing choke job and steph taking advantage of that and going bananas.

Hoiberg is playing with a depleted team filled with a broken Rose, no Butler, the Shadow of Pau, and nothing else, basically.

Donovan is a rookie coach playing with 2 huge egos, high expectations, and a bench that is so bad he has to give Dion Waiters and Kyle "Worst player in the NBA" Singler consistent minutes.

Incredibly important. If you haven't figured it out yet, this Celtics team is very "team-oriented". We don't have guys that can pick up the slack while missing crucial pieces.

Jordan shot about 3 3 pointers a game.  During this period he increased this to 3.4 shots per gam.e  His made 3 pointers went up from 1 a game to 1.4 a game.  Which is a little more than 1 extra point a game but he takes an extra 0.4 shots to earn that point.  Not much of an advantage. Also other teams have 3 pointers who benefited probably about the same or more.

I would argue the rules governing hand checks and zone defense played a bigger role in affected Jordan's game compared to today.`\Let's keep the streak going, get another win`\KCP and Reggie are awful today, also Drummond, also StaNley Johnson`\Flair up.

Lol`\You guys have SO much talent. I can't wait to see it come to fruition. `\I think the Spurs have the best chance of using the cavs strategy from last year. The fact that they've only played once and have the best coach in the league makes them a bit of a mystery. Okc is not a mystery. Not sure how you can watch these past 3 games and think Okc can win. Even when they outplay them for most of the game, they still lost (game 2) and got beat fairly well twice.

The Minneapolis Lakers moved to Los Angeles where there are no lakes. The Oilers moved to Tennessee where there is no oil. The Jazz moved to Salt Lake City where they don't allow music."`\Nosedive`\Looking at the progress of Derozan, I have no doubts that Wiggins will be an elite scorer if the coaching staff gives him the leeway to make growing mistakes. Derozan was extremely raw coming into the league, barely able to dribble in the lane without turning it over and while he's not as efficient as I'd like, I think Wiggins is light years ahead in terms of talent and progression which is why I'm not concerned and expect him to be a +25 ppg scorer within two seasons. `\I've been a Warriors fan for a long time, though they were my second team until the Sonics moved to OKC. I still wear my Mullin jersey.

I root against the Dubs pretty much every game. Not because I hate them or they don't deserve to win, but I guess I just like pulling for the underdog. Not only that, but in some ways the Warriors being so, so good like they are, is almost a bad thing for the league. I don't know how exactly, but it feels unhealthy to have one team be so much better than every other team, Spurs not withstanding.

are you literally blind?`\Might've helped, but honestly I think Ibaka is so key *even to our offense*, that missing KD and him just means we're going to shit the bed almost every time. I don't know what it is about our offense, but the ball movement starts with him being on the floor. It wasn't that bad with the Kanter/Adams combo though. `\what's wrong with that we're embracing black culture`\Only one dirtier is Adams `\Lol typical crying about fouls again. `\yoinks`\Are warriors fans just making shit up here?`\Nah`\I still have hope he can get better at shooting.`\This is incredible.`\Maybe just not start Kyle Singler? Is that a fair compromise? `\wow, why is everyone on the Westbrook hate train? cuz of that shot last night? jesus christ, dude's one of the best in the league. `\Yes we are definitely not getting a lot of calls, even though we are one of the top teams in the league at taking shots at the rim

close to last in FTA `\BALL DONT LIE`\Harrison Barnes has been having himself a solid game.`\what's three more feet to a god. `\That last loss was probably still fresh on their minds..`\http://www.goldenstateofmind.com/2016/3/2/11134104/thunder-can-beat-warriors-nba-2016-kevin-durant

etc etc`\Are you insinuating that he got carried...? Did you watch the NBA back then?`\I would have agreed with you until I watched Ibaka without Russ and/or KD last year. He should still be more involved in the 4th, but he tightens up (like apparently the whole team does in the 4th now).`\Kanter deserves 6MOY`\You think we can go 26-43 without Harden? We'd only lose 9 more games?`\Pek could hardly get up in the air, but man could he box just about anyone out. Hell, just about any*thing*. I feel like Pek could box out an elephant if he needed to!`\Looks like the Thunder bench will be the difference.`\FOUL`\I take it all back Russ `\Howard is still a really good defender and the lack of touches doesn't impact his effort level. `\Jeez Varejao read the scouting report. Ibaka will shoot 1000 midrange Js before he tries to put on a move and go around you. Pretty dumb to get beat by a jab step.`\Stop fouling, and they'll stop shooting FTs...`\T Dray up, quit being bitches refs`\Nice to see that`\Lowry 4-14, Derozan 8-22

yikes`\I mean he is leading all 2 guards in assists so...`\Tar heel triple`\I would like to know that as well.`\lmao i couldn't help but notice the sexual undertones as i was writing, but i was like forget it.`\Singler and Ibaka with OKC's only 3pters. What a world. `\If you base your entire opinion about Roberson's game on the 1-3 times a game when he misses a 3, then sure. Otherwise, no way. He's a damn good defender and rebounder. `\Of mind.`\OKC have twice the FTs lol `\Better than the Rockets or Jazz will do I guess...`\Adams really saved that double big lineup. thought Tobias would be able to abuse whoever they put on him but Aron didn't space the floor and Adams obliterated anything at the rim`\Pop is about to do some murder.`\Holy shit, Rubio hit a clutch 3. What world is this. `\When I watch the Kings there is also another team on the court. And they complain too `\Damn, that was a nice pass`\[Turtle step](https://streamable.com/h20n)`\Track list:

1. I'm The Only Silverback (feat. Steven Adams)

2. Z-Bo Can S My D (radio edit)

3. Vanity Muh Bae

4. Thunda Made Me Riiiich Beeeyaaatch!!`\I dont think that was him. Pretty sure he was still in the backcourt.`\Sky fucked again.`\Nah`\2nd game of a back-to-back.`\get well pupper`\what a weak call`\Definitely`\I don't understand. Your players are so much younger. Why did they rest??`\The Duke cut.`\Green is starting to piss me off. Acting like a child against Kyle fucking Singler. Come on, man.`\okc pls`\Nah, Durant Lebron and Leonard are still ahead of him. If he didn't have so many wrong decisions at the end of several games throughout the season, then maybe. But he is still incredible.`\Well he's taken like 15 lol

I can make 4 out of 15 threes`\I tried to get my w2 from our payroll website today and my account is locked out for some reason. Fucking taxes `\You weren't far off.`\Mustache is too full.`\[KD getting himself going](https://streamable.com/me04)`\Playing some The Division, watching the game & laughing at you guys comments.. Life is pretty good right now`\DANNY FUCKING GREEN `\Cmon KD, tidy up that handle`\Nice everything but finish by Singler `\[Adams smashes it](https://streamable.com/nhbk)`\Ok Splash. This was with like five left in the third, westbrook is shooting free throws. Hits the first, ties it at 63, misses the second, and Adams draws a foul on the rebound. Then, he only got one shot. Can you clip that? Am I crazy thinking the entire stadium thought he had a 1-1 in an NBA game?`\How would it get to 7`\The game just started `\I've been saying that he's logging in waaaay too many minutes this season. If I remember correctly he's nearly averaging as much as Harden. Not really a smart thing to do, imo as they have a nice cushion unless they really want the 1st seed. `\How does a 5'9 guy carry a team like this so hard. If we had five more wins he'd be getting a couple MVP votes.`\Bless your fucking heart Russell Westbrook <33333`\Haha this guy announcing the lineups has the campiest voice ever`\OKC down two at the half in toughest arena in the NBA:

**LOL LOOK AT OKC THEY'RE CHOKING HAHAHA**`\cant believe OKC coughed that game up..smh

They still have yet to address the issue of who scores in crunch time other than KD and Westbrook. their offense in crucial moments is still "your turn, my turn" kinda thing and that as we have seen doesnt get them far in the playoffs.

brutal game to lose, especially now headed up to the bay to play the Warriors. `\I love watching Russ play but honestly he's been doing this for years. People forget about it because he has an amazing game afterwards and they overshadow the costly blunders. There's the game 6 playoff game against the spurs where they're only down by 4 and he throws the worst 3 ever. And in his 40 pt finals game against Miami he also makes the worst mistake of the game by fouling Chalmers with 4 seconds on the shot clock.`\Thinking about taking thunder +8 and the under 230`\Really? That was a blocking foul ref`\take them to infinity ot thatll solve both of our problems. `\To fuck with DJ's head.`\Okc heart ripples in half`\Lol Durant playing for free throws now.`\He's a rookie, he's going to make mistakes.`\wtf is this???`\Between the Celtics/Rockets game and this one I've seen like 5 wtf are the refs doing moments.`\Rondo is such a dumbass sometimes.`\A bad kind`\I heard it.`\At what point is it the personnel?`\Ikr? Only shooting over 60% from that deep. What a dumbass.`\"Curry moves to 3pt territory" (note: He's at halfcourt).`\Maybe he's tired`\Bogut probably like 0.001% pissed though that his highlight backward 1/2 court pass was batted around all unclean before the highlight dunk.`\People are upvoting this? Lol`\Im a JVG fan. But ya, anyone`\Proud today`\http://i.imgur.com/cxzVkmH.gifv`\I can see why, nice guy who tries really hard and is showing some nice progress`\I feel like Pablo when I'm draining random 3's`\your friend is garage.`\That's why I hate it.`\This is some of the worst refereeing I've seen all season.`\Man, the Thunder went Clippers on the 4th quarter`\I can't fucking stand that god damn Warriors chant`\oh wow lolol`\"were all black friends"`\Serge needs to go to the bench.  Playing like garbage lately`\This has been his best rebounding game of the year. He's average at best at that. We're good at rebounding because of WB, Durant, Adams, and Kanter. Ibaka doesn't help.

And really? You think a player is worth near max and 30 mpg for rebounding and shitting the bed everywhere else?`\Fuck waiters `\He's just an enigma to most fans.

Conveniently good at the best times, disappears into the ether when it should be a normal performance in regular season games. `\Livingston always gets fouled lol

too long`\huge, keep going at him`\What the hell is going on in this game`\I mean it worked for Curry so it must work for me`\[Now that's edgy](http://imgur.com/gallery/EnHaS)`\It's Donovan, you guys need a coach with NBA experience... No more college golden boys`\Yeah and it fucking sucks.`\Couldn't have asked for a better start. How long until Singler is subbed in to stop this?`\Green's gonna have a mansion by the end if this game.`\I mean if you thought the first one was a technical and then Rondo does *the exact same thing* again, shouldn't that be another technical?`\I was hoping there might be a better (or closer) angle on the play he made. No worries. Thanks mate.`\Lmao okay`\ESPN giving Thunder fans PTSD. `\Somebody could always blow out a shoulder..`\Well they tweeted out that a ticket to this game, pizza and drink cost 17 dollars`\I don't think it's been really seriously discussed. I'm genuinely interested in how much another team would value him. `\Even in the age of the Kardashians, Donald Trump, SoFlo Antonio, and hats for dogs, I am still shocked anyone watches these ABC "comedies".`\Thats a blocking foul
`\As soon as Westbrook and Ibaka came on our defense turned to shit`\we aint winning if we dont make any shots`\Blouses`\he could have passed to waiters. on purpose.`\Time for people to accept the only reason the Thunder reached the finals in 2012 was because they put the ball in Harden's hands. Much better decision maker in the 4th than Westbrook. `\How's he supposed to work with Waiters? Also Kanter is eating up a grotesque amount of their cap space for a guy who can't play in the crunch. The coaching isn't great, but neither is their playing staff. `\No worries, it'll show up on Dawkins or something.  You da man `\> Regentius Jackpope

THE LEGENDS ARE TRUE. In the wilderness of southeastern Michigan a long-armed, explosive guard is said to lurk, and tonight he timidly peeked out of hiding. Perhaps next time he appears, the Regentius Jackpope will be more confident and capable, but I, for one, am glad just to have glimpsed him in action.`\[Acy tech and ensuing chippiness](https://streamable.com/a6wm)`\15 assists. Any guesses on his final? I'm saying 22`\It was worse here cuz Adams was basically defenseless and didn't even see the cockback lol`\until you initiate the dribble you can do whatever u want with the ball. it's underhanding a dribble that will be called a travel.

(i'm assuming you're talking about the play when he saved the ball going out of bounds)`\IT'S HAPPENING `\yo, T green up lol, he just screams at the refs with impunity `\KYLE SINGLER HOLY SHIT WHERE HAS THIS SINGLER BEEN ALL SEASON?`\That running shot by Westbrook.....

Whyyyy?`\Thats why Mo played out of his head, Billy Donovan.  How did I not realize that til now`\Choklahoma Shitty Blunder`\https://streamable.com/mqyj`\[KD on the run](https://streamable.com/hena)`\Yeah I think Dame is next closest with like 15/16? `\caught you fucking reaching, you fool

--westbrook, most likely`\Not to you guys. Or Golden State.


Also, a slump is when you play well but have some bad luck. These guys are losing because they're playing terrible basketball. `\Either way they'll lose`\Durant is single-handedly keeping us in the game right now.`\What is defense
-Okc`\gg `\I hit record when I saw him come on screen. Kinda assumed the camera would move onto someone else, but it just ended up being a weird stare`\This last games don't make it easy to like Billy`\Remember when kanter was a terrible sign? I do.`\Foul before the travel...`\Can't even get a delay of game call `\Gorgui needs to make that. Easy layup for a guy his size.`\I love KAT so much and I'm not even a Wolves fan. He's going to be (already is) so good. `\And the time before that Cousins was 2-14 with Adams on the court and 9-13 when he was off. Adams isn't just strong, he has really light, quick feet and can keep up with the crafty and athletic players, what you described is Perk. I wouldn't say he *struggles* at the very least.`\Damaris Lewis. Model.`\Shit is that what's happening?`\Holy turnovers Batman`\westbrook why do you shoot that`\lol`\super down. `\boogie going beastmode tonight`\What the fuck yam`\Forgot this game was on, just tuned in and we not getting blown out wtf?`\Thanks man!`\I saw some guy say that we're not a rebuilding team, as if we planned to contend with the roster we have and the assets we still possess.`\...`\Ezeli would do a lot better against Kanter. `\wtf did westbrook just do holy shit that was stupid`\St Louis didn't steal shit. Just like LA didn't steal shit this time around. Georgia and Stan are just insufferable fuck bags and ruined the fandom of two cities in the process of a pissing match and greed. `\[All about making that extra pass, KD3](https://streamable.com/qr3r)`\FUCK NO`\Don't worry Celtics fans okc is going to lead going into the 4th`\holy shit, look at that foul trouble chart. Refs been raping Houston tonight.`\Same man. They seem to have bad blood for one another. `\Ended the 3rd quarter strong, let's keep up that level of play in the 4th`\Very true`\I mean, I think a lot of people would object to the 9/11 jokes as well, especially if it was involving a NY team or something`\I just tried. Nope not possible `\Thunder can commit 50 turnovers but if we don't box out we lose. `\The Adams and Kanter duo plays pretty well together `\Actually, I think that was a fair block. He got the ball first which (IIRC) makes it legal.`\Singler is a double agent`\DAVID WEST !`\Isn't it on spotify? Have a tidal trial hope its on there`\When is the last time KD and Russ lost 6 out of 8 games playing together? Like 2009? I'm serious I actually think it's been that long.`\Dude was coming off a back to back and had the worst game of his season, are you being serious?`\they figured out how to use tin cans to amplify their wifi signal last i heard. `\Every heat fan I've seen on reddit just pisses me off`\|

It's not even close `\Marv and Fran`\It's more a case of Westbrook just shoveling in to traffic or too hard at close range.`\That would have been NASTY`\Hell yeah d West`\The thing is that he's a soft top 5 player and not a no question top 5 guy. He doesn't seem to be able to elevate his game to LBJ/Curry/KD level.`\He's come a long way from worst player in the league.`\lol he won't pass it haha. Dude is booty`\Harden loves going full assist mode in the 1st quarter lately.`\Thunder fans are getting downvoted too...`\That was off`\[Adams-Russ-Reaper](https://streamable.com/8sxp)`\It's okay. Dagger time. `\Let's dispel once and for all with this fiction that Rubio doesn't know what he's doing.  He knows EXACTLY what he's doing.`\Durant's transition defense is incredible. It's very rare someone scores on him in transition. `\Westbrook is so confusing sometimes. `\every gamethread

cavs fan: "if they were better than the Warriors they would have beat the Warriors!"`\Well, I'm not saying it's really bad. If it works, go for it. But I would be worried that too much iso would hurt the rhythm of the team late in the game.`\Haha hahaha these fouls are ridiculous.
Calm down refs, they have it in the bag now`\OkC is like Arsenal. They have what it takes to win the title but they're mentally weak as a whole`\Looks like Stan Van subbed in my daughters 3rd grade girls team`\[After he finds one on Tinder of course](http://www.thelostogle.com/2016/01/06/kyle-singler-is-on-tinder/)`\Is russ signed with Jordan?`\I had to catch the last 30 seconds of Rizoli and Isles. I'll never forgive them for that. `\Solution is simple: no singler, no blow out. `\Idk there were some *really* angry Pacers fans after our most recent L to them.`\I don't know. It's pretty sad watching his offense.`\Towns scared of Durant. 3 times now he's let him have a wide open dunk `\Westbrook isn't a fan of the 10 second periods before the buzzers sound off.`\What's happening to durant's ballhandling?`\Same here man. These 10:30 games are killer for east coast people.`\Spurs do have the better chance of winning against GSW, i think Pop is saving his tactics until the playoffs. I can see the warriors winning the upcoming regular season games against the spurs.`\Y'all beat Kentucky tonight so just give us this one.. `\Serious question, does Kyle Singler do anything for this team? I've watched a few Thunder games and he's always fucking up or missing wide open shots. `\No it's not lol`\/r/im14andthisisdeep

I wish I'd done the reverse and spent more time in the Bay.

It's like everybody stands around waiting for Durant or Westbrook to do something every possession.  `\http://cdn0.sbnation.com/imported_assets/1233589/ip7tCn1KGSMPH_medium.gif`\man there has to be consistency. That's barely a tap. `\I don't understand Billy Donovan leaving Roberson in the game when you are down double digits and the Warriors are blatantly not guarding him.

When it comes to crunch time he just goes stir crazy and he struggles to keep his head. He just doesn't strike me as a guy who's naturally wired to be calm in the midst of a storm. Most times he is the storm. `\We haven't scored in like 5 mins`\He jumped from under the basket and landed outside the restricted area `\I wasn't anywhere near the game thread. I watched the game though, and came to express my sincere thanks to the Thunder for whooping the Celts after said game ended.

`\Pretty good basketball player, though.`\Thoughts? No.`\Guys, this is KD's 9th season.

Getting old blows.`\Kendrick Perkins held people responsible 2nd half last year sucked too defensively after he was traded. Wasn't because of Brooks lol. It starts with Russ and KD as leaders of this team.`\Give me how much he got paid to do that commercial any day.`\Charles Barkley being salty as usual`\Like, I just want an indication that our locker room is fucking alive still.`\It's on the front page of r/nba, I'm off to university now `\It's that plus the fact that he's extremely biased which pisses people off. `\Huestis, you make the nightmare that was Singler go away :'D`\Says the Mark Cuban fanboy.`\Are we back?`\Well you could of just asked who we think is the more valuable player instead of asking the nonsensical question of who will leave, if you really cared for learning about team dynamics.

Why does OJ play???????`\People say that about literally every city `\kid doesn't look Asian`\Horrible call`\Every game some stupid shit happens to kill us. Not even surprised anymore`\JVG with the Smashburger ad.  `\hmm i just witnessed a singler dunk`\This could be a good thing, right?`\That shot by westbrook why`\in denial lmao`\Waiters come on man, my arms are already sore from cheering`\why now, why do you bring this up now?`\Mark Jackson isn't a lot of things.`\Yeah it was clearly a foul with his off hand but he got the ball with his fingers to stop Kawhi from destroying his career lol, just impressed that he was still able to get to the ball  `\Would love to sit near Doc Rivers for one game and listen to him lol`\It kind of looked like he pushed Bogut out of the corner of my eye, but I need to see a replay to be sure. `\Seems to work`\Sigh`\This isn't unique to hockey by any means. It's the same thing as basketball players intentionally giving a hard foul or baseball players drilling a batter. It's about a code that you don't break (and if you do, expect the other team to retaliate). Some of that code isn't against the rules (refs can't call a penalty for a hard but legal check) and even the parts that are against the rules might not be seen by a ref. Sometimes you have to handle your own business.

Edit: I'm ambivalent when it comes to fighting btw. I don't particularly like it because of the injury risk but I also get why it still happens and I don't think it's a plague on the sport or anything. Fights happen way less frequently now compared to even five years ago anyways. I say meh. `\Watching him play compounded with defensive metrics. I reiterate - good argument man. `\Hood* was clearly a more refined player in college. older, but he had the whole skillset

`\This frontcourt is unbelievably dynamic. `\Sucks watching the self destruction of OKC. Seems like this is the end of an era :(`\I'm not saying fire either of them. I should have said which do you guys think is gonna be a better coach. I understand they both have only been coaching for half a year, but I knew right away that Brad Stevens would be a great coach.`\

#Robot`\Jesus. Horrible offense from OKC, plus no one even tries the 3/4 court shot with seconds remaining.`\Thunder suck`\I'm not even a fan of the Thunder, but that Westbrook shot made me angry. I can't imagine how OKC fans are feeling.. Jesus Christ..`\How the fuck are we in the lead? Oh fuck, the 4th is next.`\no. pls. socks aren't tasty enough for that.`\Curry's the CAT!`\Don't worry, Mo can pick up the long-range shooting slack.`\That fourth quarter? what dafaq was that.`\Love you Robes`\People discount d so much
`\Sit down `\Yeah, goon is another term for them....enforcers, goons, 4th liners, etc.....typically all the same shit back in the day. Now it just kinda means big and slow, or so shit they're on the 4th line. A lot of them can still fight, but back in the day they'd have dudes for no reason but to come out and fight someone for cracking their speed players when they weren't looking. Now they just penalize head hunting and encourage fast play, kinda like how the NFL has done with their penalty calling on DB's. The NHL doesn't have flags like NFL, so they'd be like fuck it hire a fighter. Usually they'd come in and body the fuck out of whoever checked their studs up and then the other team would be forced to put in their Goon, and then a fight would ensue. Literally made millionaires for no reason other being able to throw a punch on skates. `\" come on man ... Come onnnn..."`\I apologize. My knowledge of his nationality and thus continent of birth was off but the slimmest of margins. (Seriously though, Turkey is right on the "border" of Europe and even has some portions that are considered to be European land.) As for him not being white, yeah. But it's not like he'd really be that out of place amongst a group of white Europeans.

My point still stands though. Calling any of these successful coaches racist is retarded. It's the same as with Chip Kelly in the NFL, both coaches have long histories of success with diverse players and now when they're suddenly not winning all of their games regularly they're "racist". `\there must be some pretty sick strip clubs in Oklahoma City.`\Enes Kanter is a machine `\Looks like we are playing ISO ball tonight baby`\JJ playing great D`\Currys been off`\Nick Young, Reggie Evans and Kenyon Martin will always have a special place in my heart because of that comeback. Even Caron Butler with the broken hand suiting back up was special. `\I guess Kyle Singler's mom still cuts his hair lol`\HUESTIS 3!!!`\Air Gorgui`\holy fuck. if you call dwight for that then dwight should get approximately 80 free throws every night.`\Parker, Green, Mills, Manu: 1-21 FG, 1-14 3PA`\drinking game: drink every time mark 'jesus' jackson says "off the charts"`\Mark Jackson doesn't know a lot of things`\Some dude is playing Need For Speed Underground 2 on this stream so thats a plus. `\Westbrook is so good on last possessions.`\That commercial is vicious. Poor spree`\wait, Durant only took one 3?

wtf`\Almost like OKC's defense...hit a brick wall.

I'll show myself out. `\Thought we were gonna blow another big lead. That shit is so embarrassing.`\How is he so fucking fast`\I like Tyus Jones' attitude, smarts, and shot. If only he didn't look like he came from a different species than everyone else on the court...`\DO A BARREL ROLL `\OKC defense much more solid this 3rd quarter, Dubs offense struggling`\It's hard to want to root for people who give no effort sometimes.`\Half glass full attitude. I like it.`\5 rebounds as well... `\Salty`\Nah, he's gotta play at this rate 5-10 more years before we give him the MVP award.`\Hahah Singler is leading OKC in +/- atm`\THE DAGGER`\Ibaka who consistently disappears in 4th quarters and Kanter who didn't even play in the second half tonight. Got it.`\Cuz we shit on you so hard pop is thinking about us at night and touching himself.`\http://imgur.com/vuOUYjv.jpg`\Lol westbrook wtf was that. And Serge missing from point blank range. Is it too much to ask to enjoy a good old fashioned blowout`\We need to make ou 3s`\wat`\Both to the Spurs :)`\What's Klay's excuse tonight?`\Two chokejob teams means that the team up big in the 4th is doomed to lose. `\yea right 2-0 because of a last second foul call for iggy, keep telling yourself the refs didn't get you guys that win`\Giannis about to get his 3rd triple double :,)`\And that's with Leo, who most of us can't stand. Tune in a game with Jack, you'll love it.`\does anyone else think this has been a battle of terrible coaching? like SVG is great but he shouldve put us away by now.

Gg thunder`\You simply adopted the choke. We were born in it, raised in it`\Kanters worth every penny `\When we turn it on, we crank it up!
Love this team!`\Ibaka 0-4 FG, 2 rebounds, 1 block, 6 PF, 2 turnovers.
Admas 3-4 FG, 12 rebounds, 4 blocks, 3 PF, 3 turnovers.
Kanter 7-9 FG, 14 rebounds, 0 blocks, 1 PF, 3 turnovers.  `\Man, Ginobili has the softest touch..`\Nba is so rigged. The refs have such a giant influence when a game is close in the end. It's obvious who the refs want to win. Warriors get a whistle if someone breathes on them, yet Lebron regularly gets pounded inside with no call. So inconsistent with calls from game to game, quarter to quarter, and team to team.`\Game. Blouses.`\oh god, my sides`\This is all your fault.`\LET GET IT DONE GUYS. THEY WILL PAY FOR GIVING US THE FIRST LOSS OF THE SEASON`\Cos he doesn't deserve it at all`\KD has been way to careless with the handle this year`\Good thing I went to Costco yesterday.`\while that's true, he doesn't usually move guys like that. He basically shoved him a foot with each dribble (in a non fouling way)`\Fuck it man, he going for that record`\Waiters has probably been a horrible influence on Westbrook and Durant in practice lol`\Kanter on Morris or Harris? Would have been a bloodbath. He can't guard them. `\That was a while ago, though I'm sure Carroll would make this closer for sure. `\I would like to thank JA Adande for not asking Durant dumb questions about coming to Boston right after he kicked the living shit out of us.`\I find I like watching Harden more when he's not playing my team`\Good shit KD. He's gonna destroy Collision all night if they keep him on KD`\No, show us?`\No. He scores so effortlessly, and he has a complete offensive game. I know Curry is pretty amazing, but I just can't put him on KD's level at this point.

To put it into perspective (until this year at least....) Curry's best year in terms of sheer scoring is still worse than almost all of KD's seasons. `\WUCK FES`\Really glad I'm not watching this.`\Both teams are playing awful`\Does Charles Barkley have a cold sore? Lol`\What a fucking comeback `\"Did you come here for answers? There are none"

Darth sion speaking to the thunder
`\# #justcurrythings`\can i ask what is the point of a mouthguard if you leave it hanging out the whole time`\This is honestly the worst we've looked all season, Roberson is the only one doing semi decently`\Check the score now and tell me the difference.`\fuck it, we'll do it live`\It's a bit late for that.`\JJ is so trash, DC plz come back`\All he has to offer`\How did Speights actually shoot 2/2 for 3PT attempts last game? That was kind of odd for a non-blowout game. `\Dumb deep 3`\klay traveled`\Stop.`\Yeah, I saw that part. But where specifically on the site can I find that info.`\We are definitely playing our brand of basketball today. The last two games were tough to watch.`\Thunder look lost on offense`\Its still a foul, its just not a shooting foul anymore.`\He's an excellent coach, he's lost the two most important members of his staff at almost the same time. They are scrambling at the moment.`\thunder play so good in the first 42 minutes of games and then they turn into a chucking contest with wb and durant `\These track names are awesome`\Is a chain mail net more efficient?`\For necrophiliacs `\He's trying for that 40-50-90`\Then why do these poor victims do it?`\Morrow barely plays anymore though. Defense is nonexistent with him.`\22 fouls on us, and the game isn't even over`\Adams wanted that yam so bad`\you would like us to lose to your Oklahoma brethren `\West redeeming himself on that block.`\He's a rookie NBA coach missing quality assistants.  No surprise here.`\His post defence is okay. But there arent many bigs in this league that are going to post up. He is an auwful help defender who gets caught out of position far to often. I dont see him improving much after beeing in this league for 4 nearly 5 years.`\He was trying to pull a Curry `\Honestly, fuck these announcers.`\yes adams lets increase this energy`\Sweet pass by KD`\He fucking tripped`\lol`\How Kyle Anderson is able to get minutes in the NBA playing at that speed is a mystery.`\This feels like a game 7`\Sorry I know a few girls named Kendrick and figured it was a girl.... never heard of this dude.`\Speights. Westbrook. WTF. `\Yeah... no`\No KD, no Ibaka... this doesn't give me nightmares from last year *at all.*

Go for 100, Russ!`\Our defense fucking sucks`\That's a damn shitty thing to say. You should feel ashamed.`\Yeah, you might take us to 7. `\Hammer Drummond every time for sure.

Man, Russ just doesn't have his 15 ft elbow pull-up tonight. That's his best shot. `\It looked like he got mugged on that last drive `\Westbrook is a fucking god`\I wanted that post game thread to win lol. I miss the silly titles. `\exactly... who gives a fuck if the man can't play defense anyway when we are on of the worst in the league defensively`\Verajao sucks right now. Hope he can pick it up at some point this season`\Filling the spank bank for me with that dirty talk.`\No foul and he misses the shot...still yells And 1. Never change, Dion.`\Westbrook shooting 3's off the dribble is just bad offense. Durant should be getting a touch from free throw line extended or deeper on every possession`\Hate to say it, but the Thunder are not contenders.  Not with that defense as is.`\Is that something Kanter specifically told him? Because I have a hard time believing someone would divulge that sort of information when millions of dollars could be on the line`\Klay can't create his own shot that we'll and sometimes he didappears. He's not on the same level as those guys. We're talking strong MVP  candidates.`\Wow. Westbrook is such a monster he still surprises me sometimes. `\I want to know how many times they show pop saying "that's bullshit" I'm convinced it his favorite phrase.`\Pause.

Westbrook has 12 assists?`\Ah its not an excuse, its called a reason.
If they have won 40 straight at home then clearly they are a really good team, so overcoming a 7 points 3rd quarter deficit is not a tricky task. Use your brain man.

Oh wait you support Trump, you dont have a brain. Lmao.
I dont even live in the USA or follow their politics and I know Trump is a fucking moron.`\They're not moving the ball at all really.  `\NEW KENDRICK THE STREETS IS HOT`\Power corrupts, and absolute power corrupts absolutely. What does that even mean`\I hate Warriors bandwagon fans as much as the next guy, but this game is miles away from a fair comparison to game 6 of the 2013 finals which you seem to be alluding to.`\[I think he threw it through the rim from underneath](https://streamable.com/xymw)


I remembered the play was a coast-to-coast so I looked up WB defensive rebounds in the second half, it was actually in the fourth`\YEAH KANTER `\reported`\whoa Cesar Milan is back!!??? I used to watch his show all the time!`\35-13 is just unacceptable and embarassing with 2 premier players in our team`\Narcissist? Lol that was the exact opposite of narcissism right there. `\Are there even Lakes in LA?`\Hey Pistons fans, how's Stanley Johnson looking? I remember being pretty impressed by what I saw really early on this season, has he shaped up into anything yet?`\Who's Huestis?`\Boogie is kinda being a baby tonight. `\RICKY GOT DEM MUCHOS GRANDE HUEVOS BABY`\Welcome to why I love my team! It's like this every game.`\Bro he's a system player that's all. `\Fake foul. `\Do the thunder even pass the ball?`\Spurs and Warriors are both on a historic pace though lol`\I mean...do you want them to just hand you the championship right now?`\That makes too much sense`\We'll happily take Demar if you dont want him. DD is an absolute stud. `\I'd rather live in a country of bad calls than unethical dick blasters`\That's ^what ^^she ^^^said`\DIRTY DURANT IS DIRTY`\Speights is shooting over 50% on 3s over the past month.`\Swish`\Durant is way more efficient and a much more versatile scorer`\that would be so lame if tha thappened. like for real, I hope it doesn't`\I know Harden will be. He looked really hobbled out there last night.`\Westbrook...`\This halftime show is turnt AF`\You spelled stupid wrong`\Onto the next game then`\CLUTCH REGGIE PLEASE`\That's kinda funny `\Thought Westbrook was much better at shooting three's than Wade?`\alright westbrook did the thing that durant normally does against the jazz`\Hell yeah!`\He's made two this year I think. You should have seen the bench go crazy as if it was a championship game winner. `\This was the kind of game that Westbrook haters feed on, but everyone who's reasonable knows this is was just a bad game. I expect him to be back to doing ridiculously good things as soon as his next game.

As for the pistons, really thrilled with this win, because it was ugly, but we pulled through. These are important games to build a team's chemistry. Morris was simply great and KCP played some great D with a few good offensive moments too. On to the next one.`\refs are shit`\JET, you have one job and that is to hit open threes`\If that's a foul, any contact on any shot is a foul. Foh. EDIT: I still feel this way, but no need to be shitty to others. I withdraw the foh.`\God damn Kawhi you are sickeningly good.`\Tnemmoc detarrednu`\I mean, OKC did get just handed a franchise`\Not sure how KD caught and reacted that quickly to the 3/4 court lob.`\It's his dad a bunch of the kids have different moms.`\He's on the D-League team. Pretty sure they played today.`\Another missed shot by Foye.`\Howard obviously didn't have the stickum on. `\KYLE "SPLASH" SINGLER`\Holy fuck Draymond is hard to look at`\NEW KENDRICK WHAT DO`\wow.`\Dear lord`\tries for the john stockton one hander off the bounce, and not successful.`\Amber Rose is magical.`\Where's the call refs?`\I WANT TO BEAT THIS TEAM.


FUUUUUCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKK`\OKC so dangerous man lol `\Moral of the story, give Durant the ball.`\Curry with the high kick. `\Maybe. But if the players aren't sure who they'll be passing to from night to night that could cause some problems. I've never seen a team play with such extreme lineup changes I don't think. `\The Thunder's biggest problem is that their offense is extremely predictable and practically 2 dimensional. They turned the ball over so many times giving up so many points trying to get the ball to KD or Westbrook`\# A Concise Game Guide for Tonight

Waiters just made a really good play to break it up.`\:D`\Holy shit dude lmao`\[Russ drops off for the Adams slam](https://streamable.com/4qgu)`\You guys were supposed to be better than what your are right now. We were supposed to be worse.`\Sorry`\Half vampire`\I had tickets to this game tonight but couldn't go bc I lost my passport`\Goddamn this is a good game so far.`\ARE YOU FUCKING SERIOUS???

`\Yelling in the refs face once is once too many and it's going to be remembered. `\westbrook`\I lived in San Antonio for 4 years (10 years ago), hate the fucking spurs.`\JJ has been really bad on D lately which is a bit concerning if demarre doesnt come back soon.`\That was a weak call. `\it's cause he's like 33, i think he has arthritis `\I think so `\KDefense`\fuck this game, team is miserable to watch in 4th quarter`\I think they play well together. Both top in PER. Good chemistry. You have to pay attention to both on the floor which opens things up. If you think the team is kind of built like the duo Shaq and Kobe were, two superstars who are the nucleus of the team. I think its more that the cast around them could be better, but no complaints about how our bench played for most of this game.

More teams today though aren't built around two superstars though which is why people think they don't play well together.`\....yeah i'll let your handle speak for itself.`\Can confirm. I'm on dope. `\Pronounced Larry-ors`\Why did you eat dice `\nonononononoyes`\Ok glad the Thunder didn't get screwed there.`\He's not really a ball handler, Harden is really the point guard.`\its crazy to think otherwise. If the mavs had somebody with his paint driving and speed we would be so fucking good. `\http://i.imgur.com/W53AiyS.png`\but they won't `\Is this something that people think? That he's lying about his age?`\I can't believe this is the first time they've mentioned McClendon tonight. `\R/nba thinks he's 35 `\WB always takes questionable shots in LA, those are his homecoming games and he tends to be out of control in those games... Kevin Durant has been playing like this since that game in golden state we lost when he dropped 40, i don't know what his deal is but in order to beat Golden State he cannot shoot 3's like this, he's an incredible player but he's not steph from that 3 point line`\man, the Thunder just made the Clippers look mentally tough smh`\Westbrook has the triple double :D`\I hope we take a big lead in the 3rd, it'd be nice to give our starters rest and I really want to see our deep bench play (plz Huestis)`\Holy shit that was Big!`\You're the reason people don't come to game threads anymore. The ignorance is so real with new teenage fans like you. `\KAWHI SIT ON MY FACE`\We've been bad all season, we've won only a handful of games where we looked decent all around. Our defense has been a mess and the only reason we were beating other teams was because we could outscore them.`\me to buddy`\Are thinkrisps the chocolate with rice Krispies inside?`\A god gifted basketball player. If you're asking where he is, he's resting this game.`\When you start to win over 20 games, you're bound to get some haters.`\hell no, it looks good on him and makes him look badass. Adams' mustache, on the other hand, makes his ugly face uglier.`\All season `\I fucking hate that call`\Kristen Ledlow has the most annoying voice in the world by a wide margin. `\>The biggest X factor is how stupid good MJ and Pippen were defensively.

Indeed.  Think about Curry vs. either of those two.   I want to see it.  I must become God.`\What's the consensus on Marcus Smart? Redpill me. `\"Johnson wins that game of inches"

OKC announcers keeping it classy`\And id still have better BBIQ then that catfish lookin pg`\And just like that it's 16 assists!`\A lot like the 1st half. `\yessir `\haha it's so weird rooting for the clips but man this will be an amazing comeback if they pull this off`\OKC shitting the bed in crunch time as per usual`\Rashad will bring us back.

NOW`\We lost it on a couple of offensive rebounds late in the 4th.`\Get Rekt Bev`\Loving Waiters tonight, great hustle and energy plus he didn't fuck up the fast breaks`\How do they give them the basket? That's against the rules lol`\lord, this is hard to watch`\comon...hes had a sick season`\If we were to end up 4th in the standings, I'd prefer the grizz over Portland in a 7 game series `\Ugh pisses me off that Broussard still has a job at ESPN`\Bogut is such a piece of shit, holy fuck what a slime.`\The best in the world. `\DAGGERRRRRRRR`\Just imagine him backing down Marcus Smart.`\Looks like Foye is the new scrub Donovan has fell in love with leaving Payne and Morrow to rot on the bench.`\I'm growing mine bc of my man crush for Adams`\Zero chance of that. `\No contact all game, and you've tried drawing fouls that way the whole game to no success.

BUT LETS TRY IT WITH 6 SECONDS LEFT AND SEE WHAT HAPPENS.`\Who won that series? Oh that's right, Scott Stevens and the Devils.`\Can't wait for this game, want to Rock the Rockets out of the playoffs.`\That's a nut shot`\Sometimes Towns just needs to shoot. `\The sky has fallen!!`\Just leave.....`\praise be singler`\bitch`\Dubs took a nap at half and still sleeping`\Warriors cashing in on all the make up calls they banked earlier. `\Donovan able to coach Roberson but not Westbrook I see`\Chuck*... Not like that's any better though`\Dat pass`\Lmao can we get a gif of that fan finger fucking his hat?`\Great. We started falling out just in time for the playoffs..... :@ :((( `\They used to let you play in the post, I don't know what happened.`\that play looks familiar... didn't rockets lose with the same exact play before?`\That was a nice pass by Paul. I hate him, but fuck, that was nice`\im feeling a monster WB dunk coming tonight`\I want to believe Westbrook did that shit at the end because he was tired of Durant's shit. He blew like 3 or 4 positions in a row by turning it over or hogging the ball.`\He's looking at the scoreboard like yup we're done here. `\Wouldn't be you guys. It'd be Heat fans.`\It's pretty amazing to see the player Westbrook has become over the years compared to the raw talent he was at UCLA. `\Clutch time `\That was actually harden trying to play d`\Warriors ice cold`\Wooo curry. I'm going to bed, can we go back to pre-allstar break?`\Shaq keeps on saying that OKC needs to trust their "others" and not keep going with Durant/Westbrook all the time. Their others are Singler, Waiters, Foye.`\Fuck.

Although we really just need the Pacers to lose, so Pistons, keep doing what you are doing!`\The late game pick n roll with CP3 and DJ was deadly last night. I don't get why that isn't the late game play every time in the playoffs. It worked 3 times in a row to close out the Nets and it worked at least twice last night against the Thunder. `\Lowry is broken again...`\Seems like he never does, he needs to though`\hahahaha`\Thinking about playing a steph curry drinking game: take a shot everytime he makes a three. `\YES, Cameron Payne!`\So not`\Wow Ibaka fouled out? Terrible game`\jesus christ he might have a trip doub at halftime`\Durant is taking way too many 3s`\This Thunder D is Raptors second quarter against the Nets bad `\Lol eject a coach,  does the game outcome change? `\Don't move there. Lots of opportunities elsewhere. `\I'm drinking scotch. Does that count?`\I'm sorry but how do they not give Curry that call`\Curry last season seemed much better at assists.`\Warriors have done an amazing job doubling KD and forcing him to give up the ball.`\He like the anti-towns. `\The fans who are still here and watching this trainwreck are showing how loyal they are`\I've found that beer is the best medicine for most things. `\nah i live in jersey, which is probably why i made such a smooth transition`\I like this Dion`\lmao roberson. poor dude can't simply make anything`\Try watching the game`\I went out and OKC were killing the Clips, just got back. What the shit happened?`\Kanter thrown down again and nothing lmfao fuck these refs`\1) ~~Not a rookie~~ Depends on how you define "rookie". He was drafted last year but signed his rook deal this year

2) Drafted in the 1st round

Got any more?

Exactly y if we face Cavs, we *will* get at least 1 win. Reggie is among the best finishers in the NBA.

He would have more ppg and Russ would have about half as many turnovers. `\Look at the lack of spacing on our offense when Singler is out there. Just look at it.

`\Kanter's got an amazing nose for offensive boards, got to give him that. `\In other music news Lil Wayne just dropped that new 2 Chainz`\Man, there is insurance on everything these days and it is obviously a losing proposition in the long run as insurance companies make a ton of money. Hard to decide what the proper amount and necessary insurance is.`\To be honest, I am a warriors fan, especially since I am a Bay Area native from when I moved to the US when I was 7, and now veering close to 30.  But this team has something special, a pure confidence in the system, coaching, and in each other, that does set them apart.  Thunder may have two of the top 5 players, but the warriors have this different quality and understanding that sets them apart.  Spurs are the only other team that has this selfless yet talented quality to compete with them.  And that will be a series to droll over.  `\The salt coming out of Chuck is impressive. GS type basketball is so offensive to him, that he can't even stand to give them any credit hahah.

edit: Also Kenny put it really well -- The dubs stretch the floor so well that certain fundamentals that are taught since childhood and have worked on every other team (the help and recover part of his speech) are rendered useless against the warriors. And then you have Chuck, completely ignoring that speech, and almost seething, "THEY NEED TO PLAY DEFENSE".`\He probably should have rested with KD and Ibaka.`\He had 18 boards against the Rockets, he's been a beast on the glass lately! `\We really need Exum's consistent guard defense back :(`\He'd be a good fit on the Jazz`\Trevor and Harden just got super confused on that rotation`\So are Timmy manu and bonner `\Refs forgot they were supposed to be shit for a while `\Nah`\Which is bigger: Number of times you've heard about how many kids in Adams' family, or the number of kids in Adams' family?`\They were forcing things to go through Durant in too many plays  I know he lost dribble at least 3 times. They appeared to go away from what got the lead. Same stuff, different coach. `\Nope too young. 35 is the minimum age.`\baeandre*`\I have argued for years that Westbrook probably drives this iso system. Nobody seems to care that his usage rates are astronomical every year. Which would be ok if you didn't have the best most efficient scorer of the past 5 years on your team.  (2nd best right now)
`\People need to stop sleeping on Kanter. 16/10 on 63 percent shooting in only 22 MPG the past ten games. Those are incredible numbers!

yes`\bullshit call!1`\I hate my life right now`\what the fuck man`\lol westbrook, wtf???`\If OKC doesn't get a bench this off season then they can say goodbye to Durant.
`\WTF TNT JUST WENT OUT`\Weatbrook's passing game is so underrated

Edit: Westbrook lol `\I watch every game. He's my 3rd favorite player on the team, always gives 100%, and is an absolute terror on the offensive end. I really think he deserves more play time even with his sub par defense (which has improved, and he's very young).`\Dont know why Casey still plays jv and scola at the same time`\Got ball but also got shoulder on with the other hand
`\It's tied`\He has very little creativity and relies heavily on Westbrook and Durant's gravity.  He's still shooting very well from midrange and from 3.

`\Chris Paul is such a good shooter, I really think his team would benefit from him being more aggressive.`\Green with so much energy `\3rd seed!`\Just wanted to say you are the best love your highlights! Also its Peyton Manning for future reference! :)`\holy shit i've never seen that or i completely forgot about it... wow`\Jb just put Brewer back in, they go in run, coincidence??`\Its easier to do that with carrol being hurt. `\It's not`\something is a bit "off" about this OKC team since Donovan came on board`\westbrook is ruining this`\Missed like 6 I think. Including one ft`\A FUCKING WALL!

-Stan "Drumpf" Van Gundy`\Well when the Clippers blow a game it's because they pulled a Clippers. When they have a huge comeback it's only because the other team pulled a Clippers. Simple science really.`\[Ho!] (http://www.jaist.ac.jp/~bao/bao522.jpg)`\Wtf is going on. They gotta blow out these scrubs but they just keep making little mistakes.`\RUBIO WITH THE GAME WINNER`\People every where on this sub refer to him as a top 5 and that's only because his teammate is also part of that 5. Also for a long part of this season, before Curry was consistently dropping 30+, it was 1a 1b between Russ and Steph. He is SECOND in MVP voting and one of the most talked about players in the league, no way is he looked over.. and if he is looked over it's only because Kevin Durant is his teammate and is just as generational. `\Refs hungry for that home win streak`\AND 1 REF`\That's what I was aging quarter 1-3.75`\I hope this fuels a strong performance for tomorrow's game. `\>older

Pretty sure he was the youngest player in the draft class.`\The Rockets remind me of the Kyrie-led Cavs.`\exactly. He has been terrible last several games`\Paul is a mini Adams. Lots of tricky lil shit he gets away with`\TIME LEFT`\This should be a good measuring stick, but I fear the worst as we have not played well recently with losses to Boston and Houston. `\You're the biggest troll. Gtfo of here`\wtf thunder look horrible`\maybe Rubio should come to the Spurs and helm the second unit like Manu did...`\No more threeeees!`\That famous OKC perimeter defense `\Why even ask the question? When do you ever see questions like that being proposed to other teams about their stars?`\He's still salty about that 54`\What... the... fuck... Ibaka...`\wesley and dj turned up the sliders till they were off the screen.

`\The Spurs are having an incredible season this year (4 games behind GS as of this post). If GS wasn't 55-5, people would be talking about the Spurs as the best team in the NBA

Edit: See my comment below `\Did we bring McGary to Boston or are we going to have to watch Collison play in the 4th? `\The voice of reason`\That's why we run Wiggins iso at the end of every single game. This time he had an outlet. `\Thunder collapsing in the 4th`\You shut your whore mouth.`\[Russ zips it into Adams](https://streamable.com/r15t)`\I don't know if you've listened to any of the other broadcasts, but noooooooo. Not close.

And I'm not saying I like Michael Cage.`\Curry out but green stays in `\Nah he's not a fucking joke. He's just like an average player. In a Kanter sort of sense. Like while he gives on one end, he takes on the other. Ends up being like a neutral, average player lol.

Learning to shoot would be easier than defense tho Imo. He's had a lot of time to learnt however. `\Jvg or thibs. We all know billy Donovan isint getting fired though. `\I don't like Gobert. I wanna win. `\OKC having a lot of fun with Three's at the buzzer`\Wasting clock in that situation is the point`\:(`\KD has been terrible taking care of the ball lately.`\Only Tony fucks up a 5 on 4`\Dion coming through with that crucial rebound over Dwight motherfuckin Howard ouch.`\Almost Speights lmao`\Grab a damn rebound.`\great, we're gonna get out-rebounded by 30 again, huh?`\Idk but thanks for reminding me!`\ok`\How about trading Beyonce for some draft picks?`\Expecting a livid Durant tonight. `\I mean the team drafted him and invested a lot into him, his actions were pretty disgusting for a team that did a lot for him.

I mean I would of been fine with him if he just played hard and wasn't a total diva after requesting a trade, he didn't need to go ahead and try to bomb our season because he wasn't given a starting spot.`\No way that was a foul.`\What the fuck is Rondo doing?`\Kcp does well`\This is somehow understated IMO.`\Damn I haven't watched them in a while, I didn't realize they were on such a tear.`\Westbrook is one of those players thats not as good as his stats say he is`\*Chocolate-American`\basic!`\Game 4 2014, never forget.`\Refs trying to gain balance with calls I guess? I mean, at least the first quarter was good.`\yikes that choke `\If they give them a shooting foul here, that will make the already bullshit ref job even more bullshit `\If that lead wasn't enough then we won't be overcoming this deficit. `\Please no extreme pogo bullshit`\Thanks as always, but do you have the KD/Russ fastbreak where KD feeds him on the sweet bounce pass?  `\I pretty much only see them when they play national tv games, so I'd be willing to be proven wrong, but yeah I would say something with the new system under Donovan just isn't utilizing him properly.

Just looking at his bk-ref page there's a bunch of things that jump out about how he's being used offensively. He's at a career low in free throw attempts per 100 possessions. He's also taking 10% fewer shots at the rim than his career average, combined with more 3s and deep mid range jumpers.

So yeah, Donovan needs to figure that out.`\Lol how the hell did curry keep that ball under control `\I want 7 games of this so badly...`\Tom wishes he had a giant head mole`\why are people so damn quick to judge? Its one game man worry about your own team getting 8th seed, ik we'd beat you`\HE'S THE GOD DAMN WOLVERINE`\Kawhi!!`\Poor pressure execution by OKC? No way...

Still waiting to be convinced someone other than KD or RW can provide offense.`\yeah we'd be 0-59 without dem calls`\Westbrook playing like that is to be expected sometimes

Durant playing like that is something I've never seen. That stretch where he couldn't hold on to the ball, and then dribbled out-of-bounds or whatever... and he needs to stop fucking shooting so many 3s. 3-12 from 3, 9-15 from not-3

And get pissed off at me all you want, Durant also deserves blame for the Warriors loss. If he would have called a timeout, things might have ended differently. His 2nd halves have been pretty bad for a bit now`\my heart skipped a beat seeing that.`\Woo one more!  also going with the invisible man for Roberson.`\Singler is such a beast`\Well he did invent the 3pt shot after all `\Lets not go that far `\Westbrook with the crappiest shot selection at the end there`\No, Donovan is your coach and he's among the worst coaches in the NBA. `\How many times has Mayo fouled a 3pt shot today? 3?`\Very though schedule. I just want as to beat the Warriors in their house.`\I'd bet on a Westbrook 50 any day than KD against us. `\Is it just me or does the thunder play by play guy get every other celtics player's name wrong`\It's just how we've been :/

It's not helping that Westbrook is out there playing like a crazy person. He's still doing good things, but he'd be doing better if he settled down`\Yeah opponents will also wave at Spurs in Rd1 or 2. `\Warriors' scouts all sitting court side tonight to evaluate if Kevin Durant will be a good fit. `\Hhhhhnnnnnnngggggg`\I dont know that bench looked mighty surprised`\Yeah, but doesn't change the fact that I think they should be paid more, considering the amount of money involved in the nba.`\Actually OU, but whatever`\I know we're down but I'm really pleased with how we're playing today. Shots will fall eventually. Just as long as we control the pace and keep playing to our system we have a shot.`\http://www.ducking.xyz/quack/`\So many bots these days... Fuck the Terminator series was right!`\THIS IS JUST SICK`\Why do we even play Foye`\Did pop yell bullshit?? `\8/28? At what point do you not adjust your game plan to do just about anything else but shoot?`\T is deserved. Get mad but you can't keep going and going and going. I agree it was a missed foul call though.`\crowd is dead`\PRAISE BE BASKETBALL GODS`\No timeouts through any of this shit. Gotta love Donovan. `\That is VERY optimistic `\Stfu`\That. comeback.`\yeah i saw that too. it's nice to know that Thunder fans hate PatBev more than Russ does. haha

He has an uncanny ability to manufacture contact and can take a few dents to the head.`\Depends if Kentucky is playing that night. `\For such a strong personality Westbrook sure seems to try and play his opponents game when he wants to show he is the best pg out there.`\"The refs fucked up, here are there names real quick."`\It was a jab at the shitty drivers in Oklahoma.

* Tell me more about how Cam Payne should get more minutes when, up until the Spurs game he would get slipped if not straight molested by other guards.

* Tell me how Ammo, who gets abused by our own defensive system is the answer to our prayers.

* Enes' offense was great, but up until recently he was too bad on defense to hide.

You know why Dion and Singler get minutes? They get back on defense. Dion does well in one on one situations. Kyle Singler sucks on offense but he hustles his ass off. Kanter doesn't need huge minutes to be effective, he's proven that. We have an overabundance of offense. We play Kyle Singler and Dion Waiters' inconsistent ass and we're the 2nd offense in the league behind Golden Goddamn State.

The idea that an NBA team would field a goon to go out there and hard foul someone into the IR for a few weeks and get away with it is so laughably absurd , I just have trouble believing any hockey fan could stand around and say the fights are actually necessary and a net positive for the game outside of spectacle. `\lowry hasn't had a dominant game since turning 30`\Is kanter the thunders third best player`\ive never seen singler make a shot before`\Yeh it seems like he's losing the handles a lot`\[Deandre finishes the reverse alley-oop](https://streamable.com/t01i)`\Yeah only when the opposing team refuses to foul him intentionally. `\I'm getting real tired of the Warriors dad dickin' us.

My bad. I'm salty as fuck about the loss. Leaving these words up for my own shame. I think that was a great game with some questionable calls down the stretch.

I just feel like it's something the refs would get really tired of really quick so it surprises me he doesn't get called on it more often. `\holy shit amazing pass from bogut`\The Thunder are playing way too careless with the ball`\Naah you don't have to do that man. There's no shame. I understand the salt completely—it's part of the game! It's part of what makes NBA GDTs so entertaining. It's like when MMA fighters wreck each other and then when the fight is over they have a mutual friendship.

But for what it's worth, I'm not a trumper. I'm not even a U.S. citizen so I can't vote, nor would I want to, unless it's Sanders. He's the only guy who seems to be stable enough to understand that the election is about the U.S. being a better place; everyone else seems to make the elections about themselves and for their own 'personal achievement'

I remember watching the Lakers vs Kings back in '02 when I was 9 and starting to learn more about the NBA. I hated that series. I became a fan of GS and basically cried every season until 2007, and then again until 2010. It's been a fun ride ever since. It's entertaining basketball and even better that I can watch and celebrate with all my friends and family here who have been tormented for years. Good luck to OKC, I want it to be Blazers, then Clippers, the you guys in WCF. KD and RUSS are monsters, hands down. `\This is great`\Stop shooting shit shots patty >:(`\Defense?...`\**'Stache brothers ftfy `\Did Klay just stiff arm Serge out of the way?`\speaking of illegal screens, what was that on barbosa lolll`\The key to success is to confuse Curry by leaving him too open.`\KD to DC pls`\That's great!

But it was the complete opposite. NBA and NFL have no similarities other then running and black people.`\Spurs really did give OCK a huge chance to win the game.

Any hopes of broadcasting Miami NoLa ?`\Oh God Steven Adams looks like Adam Morrison`\Yeah that is weird if it's a regular thing. `\He has the potential to be like JJ Redick,just give him more time.`\Fuck off Danny`\I don't care about seeding. I care about continuity. We are not good enough to just "rest" players when we want.`\Adams was straight up and down there. Should have been a no call. `\Good shit KD`\Against thunder on Saturday`\Durant with a quiet 9 turnovers`\Welcome to the Post-Kobe era.  `\OKC's defense is crazy right now`\Damn Manu. `\BAYNESS!!!!

`\We need to pull a away when OKC has their bench out there. `\Ibaka been so passive id rather have Kanter Adams ATM `\Considering we can't buy a shot from anywhere other than 12-18 feet being within 5 isn't a terrible result. `\Lol`\DION.`\The only thing better is drinking and luckily you can do both at the same time`\Well thats one way of looking at it`\That doesn't matter. You're judging them based on their performance against the **Warriors**.`\Seriously? Westbrook is easily the second best point guard in the NBA. Just because he has a rough stretch of games doesn't change that. `\these refs are on one`\Are they gonna bitch about every single call? Jesus...`\Thank god `\If I was making a movie about homeless people, I'd cast Harden as the star`\Pretty sure there are more country radio stations than any other genre in the nation, it's not that hard to believe.`\GOD FUCKING DAMNIT SPEIGHTS`\this has been an extremely civil game thread, I got to say`\They both shit the bed tonight but you're just gonna single out one play?

It's actually 8 now though`\Ugliest successful possession I've seen in a while. `\I need to see the replay again but, to me, it looked like KD's foul threw Kawhi's control of the ball off.`\Average /r/nba user:

I haven't seen him do that much at all this season. He always seems to take jumpers. `\Not a great example for him. Got dominated by west in the first half and didnt start scoring much until late when the game was over.`\This fucking sucks so bad.  About to be 4-8 over the last 12 games. `\Is it selfish of me to want OT?`\I know you have to use them when you have players of those quality, but the amount of heroball by russ is just ridiculous`\Random Conan wtf moment amidst this game`\Durant was the least of their problems tonight`\Fuck yes, Roberson hitting shots, Ibaka catching lobs. No TOs yet, but ~~5~~ 2 (Brian Davis is crazy) for the Raps. This is going really well so far. `\OKC's ORebs has allowed them to be a threat to the dubs and other good teams. Unfortunately, turnovers are still a persistent problem and they have problems closing out due to sloppy late game plays (although this has not really been a problem the last few games, it was quite visible during a stretch after ASB).`\Fucking finally, Foye hits a 3`\KD is our best player. `\bad game. he has been playing well this season. Myself and most spurs fans do think that patty needs to finish games over parker tho`\Pierce is helping OKC more than the Clippers at this point `\shoot out with singler?`\KYLE IS THE SACRIFICIAL LAMB OF OUR TEAM`\The state farm playoff commercials are coming.`\Because he thinks he's Curry`\between Durant's TOs and Westbrook's terrible shooting I'm surprised its not a blowout

I've never seen a coach do as much with so little`\AMMO IS MAKING ME SO HAPPY`\I hope the Thunder win the championship, that would be pretty awesome to see. `\Oh my fuck`\Sweet we held a team to less than 100! Oh wait....`\Lol at randy foye trying to save his percentages`\"Which kid would you rather lose"

There's no right choice here`\Same shit he did against Minnesota. `\What do players and opposing head coaches talk about?  Golf?`\can't make the easy one`\We didn't have Crowder. We didn't have Jerebko. We're guarding Kevin Durant with a fucking Point guard who can't shoot (but still tries). We got Kelly back for the first time in like a month and he's obviously a little rusty.

We'll be fine. I have faith in this team. I expected the loss, was disappointed with the thrashing. Marcus Smart is kinda breaking my heart out there. But Isaiah Thomas has been even better than I thought.

We need games like this. We need this team to learn to hold themselves accountable. The only way we can win against more talented team is if we play together.`\Clearly threw a bow`\Enes was taken out for Adams and Singler came back in for Ibaka... But to answer your question, I been liking him. Nice out of bounds play, Offense looks great at times, just he has problems with Rotations`\hey [pels bro](http://www.gonola.com/images/Pelicans-Pierre-1024x684.jpg),

[dubs bro here](http://cdn.slamonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/warriors-fans.jpeg),

sorry to see u guys hit with the pesky injury bug! Hope all is well in NOLA! With dudes like Alvin Gentry, Anthony Davis (potential MVP candidate fambruh), and Luke Babbitt, u guys r gonna be real **spooky** next year!

Looking forward to meeting u in the playoffs next year (hope yall make it XD) and getting another exciting series like last year xD!

Anyway, gotta go pels bro! Been real fun chatting with u, you guys are so classy xD
`\I'm not even impressed and this is my first time seeing it`\YAMS! `\Lawler's law. First to 100 wins. It's the law`\Aw I feel sorry for her lol`\You can say that again.`\wat`\Doesn't look like a goal-tend.`\After that 1st half I thought the thunder were gonna lose.`\Thx, will let Ruz kno`\Thunder are better without Westbrook against elite teams. KD is that good`\All I care about right now really. Clips will get theirs in a few games. I want to beat GS at least once this season we should have had the last game.`\Durant is so out of OKC this summer`\Yo, I heard Lyles drives his government-issued moose to the arena every game.  `\His teammates wouldn't be close to anything without him`\Nah look I'm a harden fan, I love his game, that was a bad pass. Difficult pass with one hand off the dribble, but it was way too far back, if he lead Dwight it was an easy dunk Adams wasn't near him at all`\Idc if hes steph curry that shot is stupid, he can easily get a better look

I'm sure the thunder prefer him trying that shit`\I'm so tired of watching this tesm`\These Thunder uniforms are ugly as sin.`\Frickin Wiggins stay in front of someone for once in your life`\Foul for all ball????? LMAO`\Haha haha Adams `\They seem to prioritize boxing out to get rebounds.

It's a good strategy when the opponent misses shots. When they hit though...`\Welp...`\Sometimes the eye test is predictive enough... I just can't see these guys as legit contenders, no matter how much I like them. They just seem to wilt under pressure.`\Good God, I'm glad they decided to go conservative. `\I still laughed though.`\I don't know why but when I read the box score I thought it said 7. My mistake man`\Big dick Rick`\it's predictable at this point too`\Missed it, call the foul`\Have you seen the last 3 "fouls" on Ibaka?`\i think if the warriors can just hit a button and win they would have done it before the 4th quarter. `\I mentioned that earlier in this game haha. Westbrook would probably average 15+ assists if they didn't drop so many passes`\same`\Ride him!`\Lol Harden doesn't play defense bro`\22 assists on 29 made FGs seems an odd line for Houston`\Shuffled feet`\no, he has always played/moved like that, i'm certain he still jumps out the gym`\Ibaka is not a better choice right now. When Westbrook (or anyone) sets you up that perfectly, you need to take the shot`\*airhorn* x4`\I just woke up from my Sunday afternoon nap, lots of people sleeping probably `\I'd like him more if the trick wasn't so obvious. Do they really think we don't notice them losing half their body weight during the act?`\Roberson not being able to hit a wide open 3 is getting so fucking old. `\BALL DONT LIE`\don't worry b I got your joke`\parker ft miss just killed your bet`\that dude is good for like 3 things on an nba court and he just fucked one of em up`\Really wanna know why Westbrook would take a runner three with 10 seconds left. Need to find a a better shot for one of your shooters. And by shooters, I mean Durant`\If it went in:

"HOLY FUCK BESTBROOK WITH THE CLUTCH, BALLSY SHOT!"`\Couldn't have made the Livingston to Barnes alley pop any shorter?`\Lets be thankful they scored double digits `\zeller is the worst defender in the league.  forget kanter`\very low`\Not quite, he still needs to take his minutes.`\that pass was absurdly hot for how short it was`\Will Barton is one.`\Mills is catching rebounds than are nowhere near him`\shoutout to the former sonic fans who are now thunder fans`\D`\Ikr, talked to her in the AMA a few months ago!`\still could be tht`\I DONT EVEN KNOW`\http://gfycat.com/TautWideeyedDrever`\What else is there? You never offered any insight to begin with, you replied to something that had nothing of relevance to you, THEN "remembered" to put up a Warriors flair. Maybe you should minimize whatever jail bait photos you have on your dual monitor so you can focus on making a contribution? : T`\Hell yeah Adams. `\I guess thats always been an issue`\I just think its crazy how like 5 years ago, KAT interviewed KD, and now he makes a clutch fadeaway and block on him. What a life. Good for him, and great win for the wolves`\Interesting stat given the first half: as of right now, Spurs are shooting 37% and OKC 39%.`\[Jay and Bey in the building](https://streamable.com/3qkp)`\kerr with the "murda somebody" face.`\Speights you beautiful man. Tom Brady is jealous.`\Completely agree. I know he isn't one, but it kind of made him look like an asshole.`\**BASKETBAAAAALLLLLLL!!**`\ARE YOU FUCKING KIDDING ME? I CAN'T BE MAD THOUGH. OH WAIT I CAN AHHHHH :))))`\nah man CHOKElahoma hahahahah`\Russell's Brussels lol`\Holy shit this thunder line up makes me not angry`\Can we get some Adams, Kanter, KD frontcourt so we can stop all these Celtic second chance points. `\do you guys think it would be good to put the small ball on hold for maybe a quarter and just roll with Adams and Kanter?`\I think ICP just found their new album name`\Green's threes are keeping it close.`\He has no confidence in his shot. Until he does he won't become a 2 way player.`\Hopefully at the start of the 3rd`\This is like the opposite of last week. Both teams look really bad right now.`\KD almost had a quadruple double `\I really like this Bucks gear they're wearing.`\It's not the national tv games...it's the top-quality opponents that *make it* a national tv game.  That's the biggest thing that worries me about the playoffs.`\Awesome. Gobert has been playing like shit lately and is also in foul trouble`\I usually say the rockets but I really hate the Jazz. My top three worst teams are rockets, jazz, and supersonics. `\Fouls on both ends. Missed the one on the Spurs for sure. `\I know he has rookie moments but do I just have a man crush or idoes Campayne just get it running the floor and offense? Especially for a Rookie I just love watching the kid.`\Our intensity hasn't been completely there against weaker opponents, honestly Saturday's game was the best we've played all season imo.`\Just weird.`\damn 15 assists for Harden`\I wish I could find the exact quotes of what he said, but it was hilarious seeing everyone attack the mods when all the guy did was self-promote and put up sponsored content`\33333333 33333333`\Jeremiah rivers? Somehow? `\Lol ESPN talking more about GS-Thunder game than this game. Wow`\I remember when those dunks used to make me scream. Now I see them every game haha. `\Riveting end to the half.`\you know I know IF if was a fifth, we'll be drunk.. but if we didnt choke away those leads between Indy, Clippers, and the warriors twice, life would be so much better `\Preach.`\ste3ph stph steph
`\black`\hot dogs at Burger King wtf man `\finally a foul`\Fuck man what the fuck you're right`\Rekt.`\Damn, I'm surprised George's career high is only 39.`\i havent seen WCS be this aggressive on offense. hes missing but i still like seeing it`\How do you go from playing on the Spurs to taking garbage shot after garbage shot. Belinelli's shot selection has been putrid on the Kings. `\I have no faith we will hold this lead :(`\No matter who wins my heart loses

after last night I may just die tonight from a heart attack`\This by far, our best win of the season. Seeing our team pull it together in the clutch is heartwarming.

Also, why does Westbrook chuck the ball with 7 seconds left? Thanks, Brodie! `\If youre broken, maybe you should just go pee in her butt`\FUCK YEAH BRODIE!!!`\Daredevil season 2 is really awesome

Are you a comic book fan?`\4th qtr collapse again`\You would think that after all these threes Curry would get used to making them and not feel the need to dance after EVERY time`\Your points are solid, but don't discount O's game because he played in a different era.   He would still get it done at both ends, assuming he had developed a deeper outside shot.

The game *is* different, and today's players have the advantage of growing up with the 3pt line and the new movement rules. Robertson (and some of the older players) just don't understand how the game can be so different from what they knew and mastered.`\KCP.

4's and 5's often ball out though. 1's too, if KCP is busy with another perimeter player.`\It really wouldn't hurt you that much. You'd have to go 4-6 the rest of the year AND LA would have to win out for them to pass you.`\Haha yeah.

Don't tweet in. Back in my day the net was made of cotton.

No one is tweeting in mate`\Morrow just shit the bed so hard. Instead of 95-90, it's now 93-92`\Oh, you misunderstand, I was thrilled the Wolves won! Not a Thunder fan. I was just impressed the Timberpups overcame all of the BS calls against them.`\Well, he could practice and stuff outside of games`\Lol what were the thunder doing just now?`\if his max is 30+ points 20+ assists and 10+ rebounds i think id be ok with that`\Phantom call`\what a tip in`\Unleash the withey `\[Step-back Fadeawaiters](https://streamable.com/hoxi)`\Legendary`\That whole sequence could've gone better,`\"You went Full Retard, never go Full Retard"--KD to Westbrook after last night`\Wetsbrooook`\This is more an outlier than the norm for Russ though. `\I get where you're coming from. I hope Westbrook and Durant aren't the Stockton and Malone of this generation. Curry is basically taking Durant's natural progression in history. If you asked anyone who was gonna dominate the league in 5 years 5 years ago, everyone would've said Durant. This should be Durant's Lebron 3-peat Miami time.`\Russell WestBITCH`\Gives him the dry rub on the pick and roll.`\Wtf MVP SINGLER`\PRINCE just  chillin`\Let them keep sleeping`\fuck`\well that's weak`\I miss it when Ibaka could hit shots :/`\The really bad decisions on the court. `\WE'RE GOING TO BE PLAYING WAITERS AT CENTER AREN'T WE I HATE EVERYTHING`\Pretty passing on that Ibaka slam!`\Is Billy Donovan still mad about Michigan and Mcgary destroying his Florida team in the tourney or is Mitch injured? Any Okc fans care to explain?`\they gotta run 35 reverse more often
`\Durant is turning it over by a lunatic, but he's the only one who can score.`\another bad call.......`\We'll see`\It's just not fair for OKC to have b2b after clippers.`\He has contributed absolutely nothing to your team. In fact he's probably a detriment since he's taking minutes away from Campayne`\Ah yes. The old Impossible object and immovable force thingy-majig`\These refs are fucking garbage. As always. We don't need your help to lose, for fucks sake. We got it on our own!`\For me the difference between OKC and GSW is that when I tune in the game right now for a game against the Kings I'm not surprised it's a close game in the first. I'd be shocked if GSW weren't up by like 12 right now. Idk why that is...`\Marques, OKC is going to play tight in the 4th quarter, sure, but the Bucks are the worst 4th quarter team in the league so that doesn't matter......`\I need to learn how to make game threads`\Jazz championship confirmed?`\I was wrong but it seemed like it. I've watched the majority of their games and it seems like every game they start slow. I'm glad their making shots right now!`\1988`\We get the Warriors at home on the 2nd night of a back-to-back while they get a night to rest.

yay`\Especially with Carroll out, everything seems more clogged with both of them out`\No spoilers please`\FFS Rudy, you barely even have to jump to dunk it. Come on.`\All ball`\I can't believe how easily we took care of the clippers last week, what was it 20 points? Granted, I had to leave early to head to work but I hope we stroll to another one.`\I feel dirty saying this but, hell yeah OKC.`\Holy shit Kawhi, you don't need to go full beast mode`\Just saying this is his worst season *ever* and he's what, 27 years old? Case in point a boneheaded travel...`\tomorrow is going to be legendary`\it's literally the combo of their most famous videos`\BILL LEFT THE STORE WITH MY ORDER.  IT'S HAPPENING FAM.`\Adams keeps pushing our players into his own teammates, yet we're getting the fouls. How?`\ey trey lyles and shit`\Damn Wiggins is fucking strong!!`\Damn, Flashbrook.`\What early Prince? Dirty Mind is fantastic. 1999 isn't bad either.`\Don't worry man. The land of milk and honey awaits you `\really do like the design of the okc shorts. `\4th quarter is your QUESTION`\CRUNCH TIME`\Thanks fam!`\that kissing dude's jacket was fresh af`\It's one game. He's been outstanding this year.`\MO THE X-FACTOR`\LOL... I saw that too
`\As and Broncos and Clippers fan, this pleases me.`\It's his newer thing since recently. Okc just unlucky to get it twice in a week. `\I would not want to be defended by a moving tram. `\KD always misses out by an assist.`\Ah ok, yeah I got the premium because I got a discount for being a regular subscriber`\FUCK EVERYONE WHO SAID LMA DIDNT DESERVE THE ALL-STARS!!`\LOL that was NOT a foul /r/ cringe`\FFFFUUUUUCKCCKCKCKDSGKLJBRES`\gg`\MY MAN! I love the dedication `\I love it when Bogut squints and looks confused after he scores. `\Durant was playing great until the last few possessions of that quarter. And after the past few games, I'm terrified shit is only going to get worse`\Dear Durant, if you want to get an assist, then don´t pass it to Dion.`\You can't stop the Thun Thun Thun Thun`\I wish I could say the same :/`\We're letting Harden shit all over us without even having to score`\hes playing against a short ass team with the tallest players being the worst rebounders ever.  but kanter is a beast`\The play by play guy is ok.`\Dion does it more often`\Durant is handling the ball like he's a teen again and is still getting used to his length.`\Thank God curry got that rebound `\Anxiously awaiting a statement game from Giannis.`\kiss cam proposal`\I almost spit my beer out over that call. `\Por Que Jarden?`\Kinda hard to have ball movement when there's no man movement whatsoever`\Better defender and more versatile ?

Lol , do you watch basketball ?

Westbrook is mr. Triple double. He's more versatile. `\OKC TO-nder`\Whatta pass damn`\Is this our 4th game this year?`\LETS GO `\Westbrook fucked up`\Good foul`\Why does Draymond Green get so much leeway from the refs? This dude is literally always yelling at them lol.`\Late ass call. `\To true :/`\Nice, you should be making plays to get the ball in his hands more`\dont mind if it do...`\I'd say thats a stretch`\Good lord someone check that rim `\Kd and cousins `\Game, blouses. `\I think he's only pulling up because he's afraid he won't get the ball again for a while.  Which is true.  `\Livingston to Barnes with the OOP!`\oklahoma is the sooner state, they always blow their load too soon`\I think KD is the perfect player to build a team around. `\What would you do if that happened to Harden? `\KD definitely said all those nice things just so Boston wouldn't be ready lol`\yes they had to :/`\Doesn't have the physical ability? Have you seen how quick he is?`\It happens too much for me not to at least partially blame Donovan.

And that's hardly "blaming everything on Donovan"`\daaaaayum durant`\Doesn't help that Westbrook gets back faster than anyone else in the league. `\I can't believe I watched so much of the game on fox sports Oklahoma.`\The blur is real `\Westrbook for MVP`\Well it kinda worked in the playoffs in 2014...`\Knew it`\Good for you, man. I've always been thinking that I feel bad for the Warriors haters on this sub, because they're missing some incredible basketball. D'lo's been killing it lately for you guys, really happy to see development from him.`\[Russ sweeping through](https://streamable.com/mwvd)`\Probably Singler, I feel like they l focus on Tobias and Morris exploiting the mismatches in offense and Singler will knock down a bunch of open threes off Westbrooks drives, I feel like Singler will score 17+`\Shit, I love thunder fans, man. May we have a good game, mmk?`\shes a gold medalist shot putter`\two in a row? not with this team.`\The fans on here can be unbearable for some reason `\What an awful shot by PG. he was fire hot until the fourth `\Westbrooks sucks this game.

Breathe on a Pacer player?

But patty has to close and he has been proving it this season. `\Well, that's the ball game. Had a LOL moment when Breen yelled Westbrook's trying to take over the game and the Thunder proceeded to miss like 4 point blank shots in a row.

`\If only they had one more superstar... Maybe someone like James Harden???

Nah, that'd be too ridiculous of a lineup. Could never happen.`\Huh.

Really hard to top those numbers.

I know Ammo is a poor defender and probably would've hurt us tonight but the dude is a career 43% three shooter. Might as well try putting him in for a few minutes. I'd rather have him taking those shots than Dion or Singler (although he had a solid game tonight). `\I'm probably imagining this, but it seems like Durant has been missing free throws more often than usual`\so who is better Foye or Waiters?`\GOAT post game thread title`\So how is it not flopping...?`\lmao @Andy's music choice...`\I don't know why everyone is acting like it's something new.

I have no interest in proving to you that Smart is a good defender, and I have no problem with you feeling otherwise. You can ask plenty of other folks if they think Smart is a top tier perimeter defender, and they'll say yes.

I'll ask you this - who do you have that's better? Kawhi? TA? Bradley?`\Forget the house, they're building a fucking fire station with all these bricks.`\West is officially on fire`\I believe the general consensus here seems to be it's pointless and distracting.`\Np fam.

He's a huge defensive liability and does nothing on the offensive end, which at least Payne can`\That might be the worst game I've ever had the displeasure of watching.

On the plus side, Huestis looks like he might be useful.`\I'm kinda glad to be honest, KD and Westbrook have forced a lot of end game shots this season`\I wonder how much do the thunder's tail spin has to do with monty and mo cheeks not on the bench anymore
`\The NHL deserves attention for the hockey it plays, not the sideshows. Watching fistfights is fine, but the nhl doesn't need them and continuing to incorporate them is a form of pandering.

It does go to show us how important an elite, aggressive point guards is in matching up with the Warriors - it's one of the reasons I don't like the spurs chances against them. `\Westbrook 6-7 since starting 0-8`\This is nearly useless to me lol. I think it's like 49 Fahrenheit? `\reggie pls`\Good passer, decent defender, and career 40% 3pt shooter. He's exactly what you want in a bench player.

Really. But the switch-everything style we have on D confuses the fuck out of him, I swear. He loses his man frequently, gets distracted or just plain can't keep up. And then, it gets in his head and he beats himself up about it, which affects his play. It's visible. It makes him a liability. `\If what Kanter did was a foul, then, every collision in the game should be called a foul. That was a bullshit call. `\Fuck off`\http://m.imgur.com/gallery/Scl5rwX`\Westbrook averaging 24-10 is goddamn impressive `\Loll don't you dare `\It's really weird when eras pass and certain players suddenly look old.  It's not necessarily that they are that old yet either...more that there's a new fresh era that hit the league by storm.  Not too long ago it was hard to imagine things where LeBron wasn't the hands down best player in the world.  But it's amazing how fast things have gone from LeBron winning back to back titles and the rest of us just waiting to see how many titles LeBron would win to see how high he cements his legacy to LeBron suddenly becoming basically irrelevant.  I mean, the Cavs still have an interesting story line and will in all likelihood be in the Finals once again.

Team were lucky to get to the second round and no one was scared to play them or face curry.

On the other hand you have Lebron dragging a team of scrubs into the finals and carrying his teams to the first seed all while being alone and young. Kd managed to drag his team to the playoffs with no Westbrook and even managed to win an mvp while doing so. Curry has only ever done well when he has a stacked team, he has never once shown he can carry an entire team alone while putting up these numbers. If curry had the teammates of 06 Kobe and 07 Lebron it's highly unlikely he would ever be able to create his shot through constant blanket coverage not to mention without golden states defense he would be exposed and exploited heavily on the defensive side (again the players I mentioned are either good or elite on both sides of the ball). Without guys on the team who can also hit threes at a high rate or score efficiently as well as defend it's drastically changes how curry would have to play The game. `\Yeah, it is going to be our downfall in the playoffs. `\Indeed, I just wish it happened earlier, I'm not sure if Donovan will trust him over Singler in the playoffs.

So you have to decide whether or not it was more likely that Harden could complete that pass, or Harden could score himself in the next 7 seconds while the whole defense is locked in and waiting for him.

I'll listen to any argument saying Steph, Westbrook, KD or Lebron are the best player in the NBA. I happen to think steph is 4. I think steph needs a very specific team around him in order for him to look like the best. The Warriors have done a fantastic job of getting that exact team, and credit to them. However, if you took pretty much any other team in the NBA I'd say the other 3 would be a bigger upgrade than steph.

It came incredibly close to happening again in the [2002-03 season](http://www.basketball-reference.com/friv/standings.cgi?month=5&day=1&year=2003&lg_id=NBA), with San Antonio and Dallas both chalking up 60 wins, but Sacramento only had 59.`\Hey make me a streamable pls.

It's just wierd to call someone racists for not playing a white dude. `\I want to know how KD really feels playing beside Westbrook`\You didn't see the game last week where it took miraculous play to squeak by with an OT clutch win, where we only held the lead for all of 29 seconds in a game with four quarters + OT....you don't see them being troublesome? `\you're a bitch. curry blows `\I don't understand Foye being first off the bench.`\Adams is just beasting tonight, holy shit.`\Really doubt that happens but ok lol`\Because he's a player for the Sacramento Kings so he's immediately subject to biased reffing`\Kawhi-bot booting up`\Honestly? I still don't feel that pressure that GSW give off from the SAS. Am I alone here?

I legitimately got scared when we played Golden State.

God, Curry is something else.`\Is there a Draymond drinking game?`\Speights always goes off against us what the heck.`\Let's just go ahead and name Speights the game MVP. Dude really stepped it up for us while Curry and Thompson were cold.`\My username is briefly relevant `\Watching the OKC feed they have a commercial for a website that combines Ancestry.com and Tinder.`\Adams come on man, I only have so much love to give`\Just spewing bullshit lol. The Raptors are a great team. They'll do fine in the playoffs`\very true tbh`\Don't be afraid of the Raptors ;)`\Ah.  Didn't make sense before this comment lol.`\He learned it from Durant from their OKC days.`\I don't think he's MVP caliber (though I think he has the potential and my big hot take right now is that he'll be top 3 in voting at some point in the next 3 years) but I'm just saying he's a historically great shooter, whose above average to great at everything else, and combined with all-time caliber MVP Curry, they have an argument to the best duo in basketball `\People need to cut Blake some slack.  Getting drunk and punching your friends is a normal thing to do in Canada, he was just trying to fit in.`\Tuesday is my 25th birthday and I've never been on a date before... :/`\**SPIDER 2 Y BANANA! SPIDER 2 Y BANANA!**`\Not looking good `\Ibaka is lost on those pin downs`\what`\yikes`\Another tragedy in the clubhouse, must be hard for the guys out there tonight `\You also have a top 3 rebounder in the league and he's barely moving his feet`\You know I wish we would get more movement in our offense but at the same time I wish KD and WB ISO would win us a 'ship this year or the next just to fuck with /r/NBA `\Holy crap Westy is fast.`\I don't know if it's just Casey or maybe assistant coaching and trainers as well, but yeah there should at least be a discussion on resting him or cutting his minutes.

I don't blame Lowry too much though, guy always seems like he wants to give 110%. `\bruh is that really a foul?    `\DG will make one eventually`\whoosh`\0 points from our starting backcourt. Can we trade Parker now?`\I don't think this is something you can put a time table on. He's got 5 kids to take care of at home. I can't imagine he can just leave them`\how in the hell is are they tied in the 4th? its the fuking timberwolves `\National Socialism.`\Seeing the difference with the Warriors between Kerr and Mark Jackson I think it's pretty clear that coaching plays a pretty significant role.  It may not be so much the actual X's and O's, because most coaches can draw up schemes with plenty of passing and off ball movement, but I think it takes a great coach to get the players to buy into the system like Kerr, Popovich, Stevens etc can do`\i swear that's like the 5th time this season westbrook threw a shot like that down the stretch. LOL MORON.`\Steph missed the open look, then nails two contested 3s...`\That was rare. I think he had been off all night, and when it came to that one, he overthought it. `\Nope. People legit said this stuff. To be fair, most Warriors fans said the same. We marveled at our unbeaten start, took out the Cavs on Christmas, then looked to February when we would start playing the good teams and truly be tested. So no, Warriors fans aren't making this up, and on this particular point, Warriors fans were saying the same thing, telling ourselves to slow our roll. `\The first half of the game is everything the Thunder should aspire to be. Both KD and WB were unselfish and I think Ibaka and Kanter led OKC in points. Westbrook only had like 5 on 2 shots at the half. Second half they started to step back into their regular iso-ball for a bit but still a lot better than usual. Probably the best all around game of basketball the Thunder have played this season despite only winning by 8. Hopefully this team continues to play like that for the rest of the season, because if they do they're right on par with San Antonio, Cleveland and Golden State. 27 assists on 32 made field goals!`\All these flavours, but you still choose salty?`\Against the Spurs? I dunno.`\That would have been good if it was just out-class.  The redundancy ruins it.`\Yeah that wasn't a foul.`\Agreed that's a tough shot`\Now you play Payne? `\Give it a try. The one with Dudley is probably my favorite. `\M8 if the front page isn't curry, it's Spurs dynasty. Hardly an afterthought `\This fucking Warriors bench, man.`\Some how with Westbrook playing like this, he's +4 and Durant is -2 lol`\hey at least that never happens at staples, RIGHT!?`\Holy`\Just went Super Saiyan right there`\Westbrook gets Adams going on the pick and roll all the time`\Ayy, same here. `\they seriously need to fix this rule. That was good defense by Ibaka`\They must not know the rule, Mark Jackson. Hand down, man down!`\I've been sipping some Klaytorate lately.`\Mediocre.  Need at least 3/5 meat. I'd ditch the olives and probably jalapeno's for 2 more meat choices.`\Westbrook what the actual fuck. I'm going to strangle you.`\Looks like Refs have money bet on the Thunder to win this game.`\I dedicate this comeback to the comment I made about 45 mins ago. You're welcome Clipper fans`\GSW is too good... They can play in any tempo you dictate them to play. They'll even play rock paper scissors if that's what it'll take`\Of course, Curry can only makes daggers but not wide open 3s`\He did play poorly from where he normally excels though`\Not at home to watch the game yet but I'm not surprised Tobias Harris has 11 in the quarter when SInglers starting.`\Normally I'd agree but its us so you have a big chance still.`\They're probably my favourite`\Took me a while figure out what you were saying `\So they give Adams the basket`\Look out for the Warriors to get off to a hot start.`\lol heat check`\Thanks fuck face`\Does KD ever have an off night?`\fuck this`\Basically, Adams is the center (heh puns) of our defense`\Klay. Please stop fucking shooting threes tonight`\Yeah that's true. Bad could've closed his eyes and pointed at the bench and picked somebody random and it wouldn't have made a difference. I would've liked to have seen Collison or McGary in there getting that start though. But I do love the Super Mustashio Brothers both in down low. `\Are you from So.Cal? `\Harden still feeling sore or is JB mixing up the playtime for match ups? Harden came out of the 1st early and he usually doesn't start the 2nd.`\Exactly what I'm trying to say.`\I love that Westbrook didn't take a three there.`\what was that pass KD`\Curry isn't really constrained by the concept of space. The same power that lets him hit deep 3s makes him step out of bounds sometimes.`\warriors comeback is imminent with KD out, no one can score wtf`\Boston attitude at its finest. Snarky passive-aggressive comments to attempt to stir up drama and then be able to backtrack when called out.`\Oh, there's 2 game threads. Mods, can you delete the other one? Really confusing`\The team does not have any more serious issues than any other 39-29 team though. Miami and Atlanta have the same record and they are flawed as well. Charlotte has a similar record and they're playing well, but come playoff time they will have the same pitfalls we do.

I just think the word overachieving is overused and misconstrues peoples perception of the team. It makes people think we are a team of hard working players that have a great coach and not much talent, when that is not the case because some of our hardworking players have a lot of talent. We don't have the superstar talent but we have plenty of above average players, even if their stats don't necessarily support that. I agree with most everything else you said in your original comment though.`\He only had a few minutes but Huestis showed some good instincts and skills, hope that means we play him more now`\He needs to start yelling FIRST TEAM ALL DEFENSE`\19 free throws for OKC 6 for Spurs. Ok`\What the fuck was Ibaka just doing?

I think I officially hate him`\That was an awesome assist. Westbrook is killing the assist challenge this game. `\turn off the 3 pt cheat codes.. it's only fair`\YAM JAM`\Damn Ernie is trying so hard tonight lmfao`\It's over.`\Woah, slow down. One year at a time man. `\Which Celtics fans have you been talking to?`\Yeah. He's only on pace for like 9 FTs this game, so that helps`\LET LMA COOK`\Ohh man 4th quarter Reggie with the nasty cross and rare dunk. I'd love to see that replay.`\Ryan Anderson abused Kanter off the dribble the other night. I have a bad feeling Boogie is going to do the same thing tonight...`\Lol 24 turnovers holy shit.`\good lord what a shit fest. hope clips bring it closer. im goin to bed.`\CONFIRMED`\Cp3/Reddick/Durant/Blake/Jordan would be crazy. `\Zoom then `\Is it just me or did Westbrook not attack the basket as much this game? Might be tired from last night's game`\Yes, I fucking am. Anyone would have left. You obviously don't know the circumstances.

And not many people left anyways. People just blow it out of proportion.

Thought it was a pretty funny comment. `\hope utah wins doe`\Dude look at it this way, 5 years ago Lakers were fresh off of a repeat championship. No matter how hard I try having any sympathy for a lakers fan is impossible, even with how bad these lakers are now.`\WESTBROOKKKK`\https://gfycat.com/MiniatureMammothAmethystsunbird`\And a spurs monogrammed shirt`\4-7-6 for Westbrook already

ESPN doesn't show a steal, though. But he ripped the ball right out of the hands of Cousins `\So many different lineups. Man fuck everyone else. I like Billy Donovan and credit him completely for Westbrook's passing and assist increase this season. `\14-52 xD!!`\> Steph is definitely top 3

Not disagreeing with anything else in your comment but is there really any argument that Steph isn't top 1 right now?`\My heart just stopped oh my god..`\You never go full 2014 Westbrook`\Warriors have won 1 more game under Steve Kerr (on the bench or not) in these two seasons so far than all three years under mark Jackson`\Agreed.`\hahaha kill me`\If we lose this but handle business in minnesota its a 3-2 road trip in 7 days and ill definitely take that`\OKC asserting dominance on the boards :(`\5 point in under 5 minutes`\KD is better than kawhi and lebron this year`\He has 3 FTs...`\Varejao loving Curry way more than Lebron.. lol`\12 points in the first quarter, and still almost give up 100

Damn`\This game is dreadful offensively.`\Singler is so bad `\Did Durant just try for a buzzer beater?`\weak eurostep by russ, that was like a ... dubstep`\Ibaka shooting 3s better than Klay. Sigh. `\Steph transferred his shooting to speights.`\Here we go again...`\Ugh.

"Okc FINDING their way despite not shooting their best." More like refs finding their whistles up their ass.`\It's pretty much the same as a shooting foul, just because the whistle goes doesn't mean the play instantly stops`\impressive!`\why the fuck is Singler even touching the ball...smh`\Again with the lax defence late come on OKC man `\there goes that man`\"TELL ME ABOUT CURRY ~~BANE~~, WHY DOES HE ~~WEAR THE MASK~~ CHEW THE MOUTHGUARD?!?!?"

Twice now. I love this Aussie!`\Holy shit Beasley just got an assist`\Dwight Howard shoots like 90% in practice. That doesn't do shit.`\4 guards on the court, but Rivers is the one taking shots.  SMH`\https://streamable.com/xnu1


I think they judged the foul to have been committed in the act of the shot, which makes it a one shot foul`\See: Clippers games. We deserve our T's when we complain like that though. Draymond should be getting the same treatment.`\I think our guys are getting tired. And Clips are finally moving the ball. Having trouble scoring.`\waiters sucks so bad, waive his sorry ass`\Fair point. Really intrigued to see if they stick together in the off season though`\So what does Curry's dick taste like?`\The Bucks are actually in a pretty good position -- Middleton/Giannis/Jabari Parker is one of the best wing rotations in the league, and they're young.  Plus they'll add a top 10 player in this upcoming draft.`\He will get knocked around in the finals no doubt.`\Play 1) KD Iso.
Play 2) Westbrook Iso.
Play 3) KD pass out of Iso.
Play 4) Fuck it, someone else Iso.`\That 3rd quarter was quiet. But he was stellar otherwise`\I'll bite

Westbrook

Roberson

Durant

Ibaka

Adams

An entire line up of really good defenders= most of team isnt bad defenders.`\Why? Everyone does it for everyone.`\Holy shit that Boban dunk was STRONG`\Lol ok`\Hot elf girl behind Donovan`\WHAT IS HAPPENING`\Okc dominated clippers all game till the bench went on a crazy run at the end`\Refs love the Warriors, Curry barely gets touched and it's a foul. Durant gets gang banged the refs let it go haha wtf???`\No u get a huge lead and pray it's enough.`\You don't have to abandon your team to recognize real. You're cutting off your nose to spite your face, ya know. It's a fun team to watch and just enjoy, dont be bitter.

Don't you think there were long-time Laker haters in the 80's who were like you know what, Showtime is must see TV. You dont have to like the team to love the basketball they play. `\Not a huge fan of Miami's which is weird because they're my 2nd favorite team. That one guy just has a voice that annoys the shit out of me.`\Ibaka has to wake up at some point, right?`\Kanter to me always plays well, his defense isn't top tier obviously but it's decent and he ALWAYS brings it as far as rebounding is concerned, the points will come as well... singler and waiters? extremely hit or miss`\typical chuck hating on Curry and the warriors`\Well, it's kinda rock paper scissors. If Spurs and Thunder want to beat the Warriors, they have to tank until they realize their bad team Zen state and beat them when they are 26-0.`\    audit in progress...

Long term solution, or lynchpin until someone else comes along? I mean, you have two of the top five best players in the league on the team, and I'd imagine championship window is only open for so many years, you know? I still think the team is dangerous and a contender for a while, not trying to say I think the window is closing anytime soon. `\so I gotta more 35 reverse...can we get more of that please?`\No, he is exceptionally talented and worth 2 first rounders  ^^i ^^swear`\That's twice now Durant has missed shots like that at the basket`\pauls been chucking`\They've beaten the spurs already.

Blocked again #bye`\No way we beat the Warriors tomorrow. Teams that blow 20 point leads in the 4th quarter don't beat historically great teams.

Warriors are probably winning it all this year, but I had such high expectations for this team especially with a new head coach. But its the SAME FUCKING THING. In the 4th quarter our offense just goes stagnant with either Durant or Westbrook taking double-teamed contested jumpers. May work in the regular season but no way it goes well in the playoffs. Thought Billy D would bring some creativity and at times he does in the opening quarters but when it comes to crunch time I just don't know what happens.

Disgusting to watch. So much talent going to waste.

And its not an overreaction, its been happening the whole year (GS game, IND game, now today). Just that sometimes Durant does make those contested jumpers and Thunder win. But our record (IIRC) against good teams aren't good, except for the Spurs win on opening day.`\As an Australian your taxation system scares the fuck out of me`\if we win this you're chasing the Pacers, right?`\NEW RULES YO`\no disrespect or anything.. but this team is so inconsistent .. `\Nice job Russ`\I kinda thought the entire game should've gone like this. Took awhile. `\They must think it is the 4th qrt now.`\Hahaha fuckin Prince.

He's probably better than Curry.`\that shooting though by OKC`\Damn we look like trash with Waiters out there, just aimlessly dribbling`\We've been asked this a million times. He's improved some aspects and regressed others. Some days he seems like he's doing an amazing job and others, like tonight, he just seems to derp the whole game.`\The fuck is durant??`\Patty?`\We ever seeing campayne again?`\Westbrook is playing amazing, but KD's TOs are really hurting us.`\Now thats what I call a very solid play!`\Bogut just lightly jogged straight to the rim for the oop lol`\Little early hacking huh?

I can't believe I'm going to be there when a streak is going on. HYPE`\Jesus Christ do you have any comprehension?

I wasn't asking if we are or not-I *know* we are. We've *proven* ourselves. You guys have done *nothing* of note. You need to *prove* yourselves in the playoffs to have any respect. You guys don't have any for a reason-you guys suck in the playoffs historically and even recently.`\That's not a foul are you kidding me`\Who was it that made that layup? They were going so fast. Couldn't tell.`\i said it before and im gonna say it again - Westbrook and Durant are not playing together.. they're playing AGAINST each other..`\Thats how you know he is working magic everynight now. Though if were being honest he really had 27 plus 2 F.U.C.K. Y.O.U. 3's

That's why it seemed so quite from him.

Still 2 days ago we were going nuts for D'lo's 39, and Curry almost fucked around and matched him just being ignorant at the end of garbage time. `\at what point does westbrook realize he's not good at 3s?`\Can confirm, worst fucking pain imaginable. Feels like your dick is literally on fire.`\Flair up or shutup. Also, Chris Paul flops the most. `\he wasnt looking for someone to get the ball, he was setting up an inbound play. Damn Grant is dumb`\Ain't nobody got time for defense.`\Yeah I just watched the replay of that possession and the play was actually really good.

Dwight came off the screen wide open, but Waiters came flying in to close the gap so quickly.

It looked kind of ugly because Harden mishandled the in bound pass, but the play itself was really cool and probably would have worked if not for the fast thinking by Waiters`\[Adams is such a clown lol](https://streamable.com/jiau)`\clips just do not have a paint game with blake out. this is...just not fun to watch`\Livingston cant`\man it would be sweet if Klay got a foul call. he's gotten decked every time at the rim lol.`\so basically donovan hasnt got okc to buy in yet? really sad bc their window is closing FAST. why not go all in for 1 or 2 more years. but like you said easier said then done with all the egos (WESTBROOK) and politics.`\Please put somebody besides Tyler Zeller in there.... I literally don't even care if its Mickey or not. `\Yeah Roberson needs to sit out, negative +/- and can't score`\We called a full timeout `\yes`\I wouldn't blame KD for leaving because idk wtf is going on with us, BUT, if he goes to the Warriors I'll eat his children`\And yet Singer is out there chucking up shots`\what is with russ...`\Clippers announcers said they were giving it to OKC after review, but they were mistaken. `\*Insert witty comment bashing Tidal*`\Let Westbrook shoot, you stop Durant`\so is this team`\I just use wingdings. `\This game is definitely winnable. Raps need to hunker down, get out of the begging for calls mentality and also move onto perimeter shooting.`\Ref didn't have the balls to call it`\Highly doubt it.`\Durant just saw the bright light at the end of the tunnel on that one. `\KD out here passing the ball like Harden`\No`\Donovan just did brooks face`\As he fucking should `\[KD block and fall](https://streamable.com/x45d)


looks like he fell on Foye and came down hard after the collision`\It's that Australian vs New Zealander rivalry. `\What the fuck was WB doing on three there`\Well he just fucked your squad so you should care`\Might as well let him go this off season`\He must feel like he's getting too close to the 3 point line so he has to take a few steps back.`\> thunder are good but the thunder have been good for awhile, there's a reason they don't win

You mean the fact that they don't run an actual offense? I honestly don't know when I last watched the Thunder run a set and thought "huh... that's some high level shit right there." I see more creative and intelligent basketball from the Pistons and Blazers. But then again... Durant and Westbrook, so...
`\okc and cleveland are very similar in the regard that they're incredibly top-heavy. okc could possible take cleveland in a 7-game series.

they're both 3rd tier teams. 1st tier - warriors. 2nd tier - spurs. 3rd tier - okc & cleveland. 4th tier - clips and raptors.

no one else worth mentioning.`\Yeah, that 1 regular season game is really giving Pop nightmares.

Fantastic performance by #35.`\OKC is actually what people think the Clippers are`\He played really well against Boston. Other than that, meh. `\We just don't know how to draw up a clutch play. `\Now *this* is shitposting!`\see guys, singler can play!`\Yeah I agree. Oh damn lol I wish we got to hear more court audio like that `\No Cam Payne :(`\AND 11 REBOUNDS AND 5 ASSISTS AND 5 BLOCKS`\*You're* complaining?`\Kanter's rebounding is something else!`\[Steph is playing fuck yeah](https://twitter.com/StephenCurry30/status/705582433626775552)`\Singler is the most under appreciated defender in the league. Fuck the haters and fuck your circle jerk.`\Diaw didn't foul there right?`\You're right, that would have been a better way to phrase the question, I only thought about it in the sense of all the talk about KD's contract at the end of the season and then Westbrook's at the end of next year.

Like I said, I am ignorant to this subreddit and in general the sport.`\Thanks! I thought that dude had a great voice too. `\Nah`\Jordan is taking over. We can't stop him`\OKC chocked harder than OKC`\A KD turnover, shocker. `\God I can't imagine what having your team taken away feels like`\Singler gets some good looking threes every once in a while.`\Lavine and Wiggins still need some work, but KAT is something else. If he bulks up then he really wont have any weaknesses on offense.`\Loving these passes `\All these people talking about Durant leaving Oklahoma City, I just don't see it... He hasn't seemed like he was unhappy there, unless I'm missing something? `\In our game last night there were guys falling on the floor with no calls. This is complete opposite.`\More or less. But legacy won't mean that much if you don't have success.`\MM is so fucking good`\God damnit`\Tired of shitty lineups and not utilizing our bench players`\just tuned in from that exciting mavs/kings game. my only question is: is the 3 point line still turning red?`\Yup, I also think that they're spacing is not that good compared to GSW and SAS`\Barnes for Secretary of Commerce `\A pats/ thunder fan?`\Uh oh LA`\Did OU win? I haven't really paid much attention to CBB this year because the Thunder have no draft picks. `\This disparity in free throw attempts is troubling. `\It's so fucking rare to see a guy that raw come in and be as dominant as rus is, but at the same time change his entire approach to the game, and dominate while doing it? i think we are in unseen territory, lowkey tho`\holy shit rip pat bevs ankles and all joints of his body actually`\KD STOP TURNING IT OVER FUCK`\man if only westbrook could shoot 3's.
`\Because Portland will be the 4th seed.`\It's painful for us too`\Our new fourth quarter strategy...be up by so much it's almost impossible to blow`\Dwight looks really off.  `\u on mobile?`\In the 90s, Jordan was the best player in the NBA. Chuck or whoever may have been second best, but that doesn't mean he's in the conversation for best. Durant and Westbrook are 2 top 5 players in the league, possibly top 4. Steph is definitely top 3, but is Klay in the top 15? Probably around there I would think. You can definitely build a legitimate contender around Steph, Durant or Westbrook, but probably not Kay.

All this to say, I think steph and klay are definitely the second best duo in the NBA, but that doesn't mean they're in the conversation for the best. `\Like OKC has 4 players worth a shit, Adams, Kanter, Westbrook, and Durant. The other guys should be in the D league`\I thought that since collison was already ahead of him and just moved towards him it would be a common foul. But I'm dumb so it makes sense that I'm wrong`\i love the kiss cam`\That's Prince, bro. He doesn't shower without sunglasses `\Westbrook is struggling on defense.

Regardless, I really hope we switch up our defensive scheme over this summer. The old one worked when Ibaka could cover everyone's ass by switching on wing players and keeping up with them step-for-step. It's a phenomenal ability to possess, but ultimately I don't think we should be relying on that anyways. Being that quick at that size is not something that will stick with you as you age, and if he got injured or left the team it's not really a hole you can just fill. There are only maybe four PFs in the league that can defend the perimeter and the paint at an elite level. I'd like it if we kept Ibaka in the paint more often, he's still top 2 or 3 on rim protection regardless of regression.`\Mo is our new 3&D specialist`\Speights need to chill, this is ridiculous.`\He just made two huge threes though`\https://media.giphy.com/media/f7pLvgmeU2ZVe/giphy.gif`\I know man I feel for you guys.

Trying to play defense is getting you into trouble.`\Yes, I also saw the refs hold their whistles early on in the game when Demar/Lowry were taking it to basket which set the tone of the game. I also saw the same offense that relies way too much on Lowry to score meaning 35 minutes in a blowout. I also saw the same starting frontcourt of JV/Scola which gets routinely abused in the first quarter.

 We both agree that this is not a personnel issue as this Raps team is arguably the most talented team in their history, but adjustments need to be made going forward.

It's great to get a 20-30 point lead but if you're getting it and then playing gassed in the fourth maybe it's better for the coaching staff to analyze and better space the minutes.

Or at least against opposition where you guys are playing "better defense" it ends up being more of a physical effort based endeavor than necessarily a better defensive IQ endeavor.`\WTF TNT FUCK YOU`\this guy http://i.imgur.com/QyU3O1L.gifv`\He is trying to stick to this rotation. `\"i used to use stick em"

There are people on the ice whose job it is to make sure no one is getting hurt and they are called the refs. And when the player ignores the refs and does something rash such as any of your examples, there are guys in suits sitting in an office in NYC whose job it is to punish you enough such that you or no one else ever does that again.

The idea that players get so jacked up but they have no choice but to either a) get into a comedically useless fight or b) maul your face with a hockey still is laughably absurd. And if a player *did* decide to maul you because he wasn't allowed to punch you he'd get a nice 20 game suspension and wouldn't fucking do it again.

Top 5 this season

1. Curry
2. Kawhi
3. Lebron
4. Kevin Durant
5. James Harden`\He's been a running disaster in the last two minutes of games. `\Soft ass calls getting the Warriors to the line and then Durant gets hacked no call.`\Singler did pretty good`\Give the ball to Giannis in the open court Khris, instead of a useless pass to Jabari.
`\YOU GUYS ITS LOCAL FAVORITE TYLER ZELLER`\I'm pumped for Huestis, show BD what you can do :D`\:(`\I'm 100% waiting for the 4th quarter to see if OKC can hold it together.`\Idgaf `\bro you know we are the most entertaining team right now `\why in the world would you try to lob it there?`\Thanks for 2 wasted possessions russel`\LOL Jamal being guarded by Durant was hilarious. Literally posted him from the 3 point line to the elbow in 3 dribbles. Man Jamal is such an awful defender`\even when mo is good hes bad`\All season`\That was not a shooting foul. `\ENES KANTER BETTER PLAY THE WHOLE DAMN 4TH`\sometimes you just gotta chuck it up`\He'd probably turn it over tho`\Yeah KD was mugged not gonna lie.`\Adrien Payne? He plays a little like a goat sometimes.`\Man, Westbrook is still playing wild, what is wrong with him.

We're also getting a lot of calls/no calls our way, which is probably the only reason we've still got a decent lead, the Bucks are killing us this quarter. `\I was so close to jizzing.`\KD calling Kawhi a system player after the championship season. Not too sure about the rest. Then deleted the tweet or whatever it was, and then apologized-- but not really. More or less disrespecting the finals MVP.`\You won enough. Its other teams turn`\Oh dear kd not very nice `\Wtf was going on there? The sound is turned down at this bar. `\I'd say KD/Russ then Adams/Kanter. I'd say KD and Russ are tied for first and Adams and Kanter are tied for 3rd. Why doesn't Kanter play more? Who freaking knows... `\srsly?`\Late ass call`\Oh, maaan. If the Thunder lose, tomorrow is going to be FUUUUUN.

The Thunder are gonna be so pissed.`\We gotta increase our lead if we're going to compete in the 4th quarter `\C'mon Singler, Foul!`\What the fuck did the All-Star Break do to us?`\He also had a block on Beasley earlier in the half. His post defense is the best part of his game. Unfortunately, that is pretty much irrelevant in today's NBA.`\Who else saw Beverley and Westbrook high five each other at the end? That's never ever happened before `\What is the recipe for rattlesnake jam?`\Westbrook flopping like a frog out there`\He's married`\damn that is ICY`\i honestly feel for you guys. i respect the hell out of your team. wish we could have won without durant and russ collapsing, but well take the W. give GS hell tomorrow, ill be rooting for yall.`\We want the trip dub and 5x5 same game please`\Who does?`\amazing ball movement and amazing motion off the ball`\If I had to say is a weakness of Kawhi's offensive game, it's his ability to drive and create contact. His post-up game his top tier, but he shies away from driving unless there's a direct path. `\hahahha wtf westbrook. seriously he SPRINTED AWAY to leave Green open in the corner.`\NIIIIICE Aldridge, hell of a shot.`\KD over Kobe and way over TMac. MJ and Wilt are the only arguments imo. Maybe Kareem if you're looking at longevity.`\I love when the announcers just start talking about bullshit when it's a blowout`\All the Laker fans warned me about Wes Johnson. They said he's gonna start off with so much promise and then you're gonna hate him. I didn't believe it. I should've listened `\its pretty sad. it starts with westbrook. hero ball ruins the flow. and its contagious (trust me i know)`\Something something coco`\Isn't the iso-ball offense their main problem?  How would Thibodeau solve those problems?`\marilyn manroe is rolling in her grave `\Good recognition that Singler is guarding Wiggins.`\I'm from DC, so I go to Wizards games and while their hype man and stuff are better, the one thing OKC does is get EVERYONE in the stands involved. If you're not really close in DC, you're getting ignored.`\CLUTCHbrook!!!!`\That's the Magic of Danny Green.`\They don't need to. You just saw it work. It's more effective to just foul him, he's that bad at free throws.`\wait what`\Celtics not showing KD any reasons to come here next season.`\Bro, this is every single 2nd quarter for us all season.  We just can't do them for some reason.`\Well he said some nice stuff for Dwight in the pre game`\Mr. 4th Quarter`\because in the playoffs, you guys fail every single year and to give up a 3-1 lead gives people a bad taste in their mouth `\i can tell, KD will be chucking up 3's tonight like he did in sac town`\Oh so it's going to be *that* kind of Speights night XD`\Bet you'll never do that again. Better pray this game doesn't go to OT. `\this just got good`\Raptors are in playoff mode already.`\not sure tbh. myth of worse defense than singler maybe? we here in the thunder fanbase definitely want him playing more than singler`\How many times must I say that I'm not looking to argue with you? I've said multiple times that whatever I say won't change your mind. Take a look at defensive rating. Take a look at defensive win shares adjusted. Take a look at opponents FG%. They all speak to Smart's strengths. I'm not going to sit here and compile numbers for you to look at and say "nope doesn't matter". `\Spurs fans, what does having a good coach feel like?`\[If you meant at the mas hysteria spot then no](https://streamable.com/xhgd)`\Holy shit you are clueless. You're calling me a bigot while you sit there generalizing about Trump supporting Americans. You're the only one here saying anything bigoted.




Trump is not racist in anyway at all. I have listened to hours of his speeches and he has never said or done anything racist.








Muslims are not a race. Islam is not a race. It's a religion. When he talks about Muslims, he's talking about all the races who make up Islam.







So you're saying the majority of Americans are redneck bigots? You live in a small world man. You're so sad and closed-minded. Your ignorance is baffling. What's even worse is your ego. You're convinced that you know what it's like here in America when you already said you don't even follow the politics. What the fuck is your problem?





What kind of jackass starts a political argument in /r/NBA when they admit to not even following the politics here? Get a grip man, you're very sad.

`\Anyone else see those weird boot things KD was wearing?`\Fucking hell Kd`\He's not so good with the words.`\Oh Kk, I just got home n put it on `\Well, maybe Smitch`\Wait did I see Nazr Mohammed? Forgot we picked him up.`\Type 2%`\Use both hands to jerk off`\I legitimately hope that woman loses her voice for writing that song.`\my god, when has Steph ever had that much time for a 3?`\lmao you made a whole post about me hahahahahha`\I know, but as a Dubs fan I can't weigh in on a predication without bias, as much as I think I can, I'm sure it's always subconsciously swayed because of my fandom.

So yeah, my initial reaction would be the same predication and logic as yours, but my bias can't help but think that any sense of confidence against such an offensive juggernaut of a team like OKC would be ridiculous to have. `\I can only imagine how Dion must feel so if he wants to take the rest of the year off to get his emotions back, he can definitely do that `\LIGHTS OUT`\Can't keep letting them get these easy rebounds. Bring Bogut in`\it is what it is. we went to OT with OKC on that call`\LMAO that call`\Doing his Derozan impression?`\Westbrook's turnovers have been so stupid`\You can't fucking say that`\ but this means he isnt 100% serious in this game`\Fuck Reggie's bitch ass.`\Singler just shoots very strong that's why he misses`\Wtf is this shot selection `\Core training`\I'm not sure they are dumb as much as they are poorly coached.`\woo jeopardy!`\almost ibaka`\I love pulling up /r/nba threads for nationally broadcasted Kings games just for the sake of watching other team's fans complain about Cousins.

`\I believe that was implied. `\Salty fan here. Holy shit our asses got spanked.

He wants him to shoot righty, though.`\RUBBBBBIIIIOOOOOO`\It's true and bullshit at the same time considering they start the game together and usually blow out the opponent in the first 5 minutes of the game.`\Gotta learn that fusion dance. `\amazing`\kd wasn't even in the game during that stretch we lost the lead, calm down... dude averages 10+ assists a game chill out with that 2011 narrative, ok?`\If he's not coming back Wednesday, it's going  to be next week, I'm confident.`\Even better than we were the last time baby`\Going to out assist Rondo `\Actually nobody was guarding Howard. He was wide open. Luckily Waiters rotated down.`\Yo Aldridge is fast as fuck`\No offense, but your friend sounds like a pretty shitty person`\Fucking Bogut`\Copy and paste`\They have. In fact, they've won 42. `\I love KD but his quarter ending pullup 3 is so predictable `\Kanter is playing some good D on Cousins`\What the fuck are you talking about?`\Apparently if you look at these refs he wrong way it's a tech. Come on man`\If there were no Curry wouldn't it be Klay breaking all those single-season three records and stuff?`\Td`\We're also undefeated in the Chuck the Condor era`\yo goddamn
`\https://media.giphy.com/media/P2N1FHbu430Xe/giphy.gif`\Oh yeah I forgot, we should be super excited. I mean, we're only two years off our epic 40 win season!`\Steve Kerry`\Man, I was monitoring that box score in the 1Q and was so excited and then the Bucks kinda just kept up with us. Glad we got the W. I fuckin' love Giannis, that dunk on Ibaka was just awesome.


Edit: Holy shit, Kanter with a beautiful looking box score too. `\If anything he got all ball wtf.`\The Timberwolves don't get superstar calls yet. I'd give them a couple uncalled under the basket. Circle back in 2 years and see if Wiggins falls over without a whistle.`\When's the last time 2 players on the same team got a triple double in the same game? Because Westbrook and Durant are close`\We just don't capitalize on opportunities.`\Refs have been sketchy in the 4th.`\lol westbrook is retarded`\Haha, OKC people are angrier than when they realized they're never winning a championship.

PS: As a Suns fan don't cry to me about it either! `\The other commentator said "I wonder if the stickum was messing with his free throws" after Dwight made one.`\No problem man`\A coach that can take advantage of their crazy roster. They have so many opportunities to exploit other teams. `\Probably a little bit of both. I used to underestimate coaching in the NBA, but getting an elite coach really seems to be the difference a championship contender and an also-ran.  Seeing coaches like Kerr, Popovich and Stevens get the most out of their talent really makes you appreciate what a good coach can do for a team.  At the same time though, players should realize that iso-ball isn't going to get you far against elite defensive teams and you need good ball movement `\The bank is actually open right now, wow.`\Also they're finishing a back to back. `\OKC rolled snake eyes`\Don Cherry is the worst.  He is a like a shitty racist Craig Sager.`\YALL ARE COMPLAINING`\I am from Vancouver. You might be thinking of someone else since I just flaired up.`\woooooooooooooo`\Marcus Morris I love you`\He may be inconsistent as hell this season, but I still love the man and would never want to trade him`\I think he's one of the best 1 on 1 defenders in general. His rotations are still sloppy at times, but yeah, trying to iso against him is just dumb.`\No, still LA.`\If we played defense like we do against GSW every night, we'd blow out every team in the league. Except the other top teams.`\

Maybe I'm too confident, but LAC is a team that doesn't really terrify me as a playoff matchup against GS. OKC and the SAS are two teams I don't want to go near at all in the playoffs, but know at least one of them will be spending around 5-7 games making me stress the fuck out in a few months. `\Woah shit all our SGs playing good D tonight. `\What's up with all these airballed lay ups o.O`\good strategy green, i like it`\no worries, i forgot to throw in a /s in my reply.`\This guy definitely just tuned in `\I would have personally taken up a collection to pay Boogie's fine if he had decked  Adams there`\man i havent had cable for like 3 years now, i have no idea what any of these shows are on these ads...`\I wouldn't ever bet the field against Westbrook and Durant`\Doesn't matter, you grab the rim while the ball is still above the cylinder and it should be waived.

Thus, I believe his numbers are almost dead unless Leonard and Aldridge are not playing well. `\iggy was prayin' to jesus`\Cause OKC's bigs will kill. `\HORY SHIET WE WON

Breath of fresh air. `\Fucking RIP`\tag you're it`\I would be ok with this`\Welp, singler has been ruled out for the game, looks like we're screwed. GG rockets `\After the all-star break, KD had been playing point guard when Westbrook sits. We had traded Augustine, teams were abusing Payne on defense and Waiters was away from the team. KD can handle the ball well, but it's not something that he really should be doing so often.`\*Oh if you only knew....*`\Just play smart basketball. Please.`\The Rockets always have a flair for the dramatic (no pun intended)`\Thunder 14 TO, Clippers 6 TO. Weird. Feels like they're just passing it back and forth to one another `\Jordan too clutch`\That bad, eh? But I meant in general, I can count numerous games I've watched where I've seen people leave when it's a close game and there's 5+ min left , I don't get it`\I am very mad right now. I watched the game up until about the 1st half of the 4th quarter. Decided turn it off as it seemed like it would be a waste of time since OKC would definitely win. 5 minutes ago, I decide to check up on ESPN and see the main story in their homepage say, "Clippers come back.."  I cannot believe it! I missed two great games in two days. First, the Hawks v. Warriors game as I'd thought Curry was playing and it would be a decisive win by Golden State. Now, OKC v. Clippers. Jeez. `\Lol no one cares about the Bulls. `\It is full proof


I checked it on my calculator `\4TH QUARTER REGGIE PLS`\These refs man...`\>half glass full`\According to your logic LeBron is getting paid to *not* bring a ring to "the land" `\The 2nd cavs golden state game I think.`\DeAndre Jordan especially if he was on the Mavs`\No, it literally just did. Their lead nearly doubled when they started doing it lol.`\i dunno man... i think we are a different animal for the warriors as opposed to other teams... that fast paced run and gun style we basically laid the foundation for what the warriors are doing now, they just took it to another level... not in terms of 3 point shooter but just sheer high powered offensive capabilities... As good as their defense is against other teams just doesn't seem to affect Kevin Durant at all, he scores at will on them as easily as he does any other team int he NBA.... Rus for some reason doesn't get nearly as many calls against the warriors as other teams which is odd but ok....  my biggest concern right now is the cavs dude, if we do get past the warriors and the spurs then we play the cavs.... and as confident as i am in this team in beating the warriors, i think we have absolutely NO shot at beating cleveland... THEY expose our flaws to the fullest, not golden state..`\I be going down in there lol `\I love you guys so much. Seriously `\I think it hilarious that Donovan doesn't play Kanter more. His defense is not that bad. `\Didnt realize that. Im struggling trying to alternate tabs between homework and the game`\Yes, and now they're down double digits and KD has like 10 TOs and Westbrook is 6/1000 from the field `\mvp`\Couldn't be worse than Trump right?`\That pass proves ibaka is the worst Passer in the  league`\I think most Thunder fans think that Ibaka has been underperforming lately, and they like Kanter, so yes. But at least Ibaka can defend`\That was a bad call ref, Ariza totally tipped that out`\Did pop just reference the basketball gods?`\Guys i want to see a civil thread, no salty downvoting, no excessive ref blaming etc.`\I enjoyed both. `\Nah Walton is a better passer`\Loooool`\Definitely the last one. Our awesome run coincided with his injury fucking lol`\it was lol`\Disagree there reddit fan base is...obnoxious. `\Kawhi! Yes `\...or like last night, wtf.`\shoulda been and-1`\So an and-1 for the made free throw by Westbrook?`\if they're actually better with blake, I can see it. they matchup well `\GG OKC`\I actually sort of predicted this but for the game on Saturday night instead of tonight. Also they won by exactly 15

Confidence is good, but sometimes it bites you in the ass if you're not paying attention.`\Pls Raps....`\lmfao Harden`\Leonard is a superstar right now. No question about it. Fuck man.

Tonight I honestly wasn't unhappy with any of the shots WB took and it obviously paid off.`\I love the thunder, but man I feel like their supporting cast is weak`\I don't think they count the TO if the team recovers it in the end I guess.

Goddammit I missed it. :\`\It's not like the dude is clearly [not white](http://sports.cbsimg.net/images/visual/whatshot/enes_kanter_070915.jpg) just by looking at him. He could easily just have grandparents/parents that immigrated. As for his broken English, that's a completely different thing I didn't equate for since strangely enough I don't listen to Kanter speak that much.

And as addressed in a separate comment, the word they most likely meant to use was "intolerant" and not racist. Which still applies to my point of calling it bullshit that a coach capable of his success is making decisions based on one players accent. `\:0`\Its rare to criticize Stevens and all but he isnt allowing the Celtics to properly match up with the Thunder. `\He's been playing well lately`\How are you ever going to lose if you score 121 points?`\Is there any real reason why Morrow and Payne is not playing?`\C'mon Huesty!`\Man, DeAndre's shooting mechanics are just awful. `\Kawhi is everywhere`\I've noticed that too.

You're clearly not going to change your mind regardless of what I say. There is a reason that folks are downvoting you and not me here. What you're saying doesn't hold any water - it's just an "edgy" opinion about a guy that opposing fans hate. Everybody knows Smart is a killer defender. You're free to feel otherwise, but I'm not in the position that needs to be backed up here - you are. `\Foye's got those huge ass arm bands on..`\Adams is talking shit, Reggie doesn't even need to respond`\Not often a player just needs points to complete the triple double.`\SLIM REAPER LETS GOOOO`\lol 76ers fans`\I just woke up my house`\100%. `\What an ugly pair of games from Westbrook. Weird to see. `\Curry was forcing shots tonight, but damn his driving ability is amazing. `\I wouldn't even be mad

Him and Westbrook deserve better`\Well that Stauskas fan got what he wanted, a 20+ game from the Sauce`\Ill apparently. I don't think he would've gotten much time anyways. `\Makes a better narrative. `\[lightning break](https://streamable.com/32ms)`\There it is. Singler did not ask Curry for permission when shooting that 3.

I hadn't thought about it from that angle before.`\Everything sounds so forced on ESPN lol`\good ball movement`\I mean I'm not going anywhere so I guess we'll have to wait and see. It just doesn't seem like their year. They're on a crooked path, seems like there's an issue with chemistry.

Same with the Clippers. Both are incredibly talented teams but I feel like there's an element missing. `\It's hard to overstate just how difficult that shot was that Barbosa just hit. Full speed fading bank shot from a bad angle. `\why can we not finish games`\neither of them played 40 minutes tho. `\Lol I'm talking about warriors vs rockets not a win vs the sorry ass Pelicans. `\Yeah, this is a good show`\What is this game `\what was that kek`\Jeff Green was balling early into the 2nd half then I didn't notice him until now.`\It must not be cuz I'm watching the game right now from it. In HD too. I was honestly surprised when I found out it worked last week. `\.seY`\lol`\The halftime show got me feelin some type of way`\I'm not sure I've ever been so wrong to be excited about a signing before.

I didn't think Foye would be great, but I thought he'd be acceptable. I couldn't be more wrong`\Lmao please stop. `\Ibaka is ass this year`\That's a smart play. Good job Kiwi`\Kevin durant is single handedly making us lose this game every time he posts up`\fuck.... I feel hope but OKC loves to break my heart </3`\you'll see, trust me `\Close them out.`\They forgot how to do things.`\Difference is Kobe was an elite defender who locked up his man and Shaq provided elite rebounding and was a vacuum in the paint cleaning away the mess. An elite SG and C who play both sides can easily have a succesful team built around them. Westbrook and KD need better defenders around them. Bottom line`\Seriously, fuck Russ.  And I like the guy, but for Christ's sake, you have a guy shooting 11-17 with 29 points.  Give Durant the fucking ball.`\Sounds legit.`\Clips GSW WCF`\Can we throw Nick and Mitch in that too? These rotations are cancerous`\Let's dispel this notion that Westbrook doesn't know what he's doing. Westbrook knows exactly what he's doing.`\Spacing is pretty bad right now.

Only Crawford is capable of scoring.`\I can't stare at Adams for too long.  It makes me uncomfortable.  `\confusion its supposed to work on them but we get confused instead.

We need Danny Green's offense tonight. `\Tim "James Harden" Duncan`\How? Close game for the first 3, close game in the last.`\Fuck ibaka this guy always fucking things `\cmon russ`\Have you somehow created a PC that's not known to man and spliced all Internet together into supernet?`\Deandre Whiteside Jordan`\Also, injure singler`\If you dont have a stream, you can find the OKC v HOU youtube stream on /r/nbastreams`\lol kanter should have grabbed that`\I hate that rule honestly. If the offensive player initiates all the contact then it shouldn't be a foul.`\remember when it didn't matter if your team had like a 10 pt lead against the thunder because you knew kevin and russell would somehow go super saiyan?  `\AYEEEEEEEE AND ONEEEE`\Barnes and Rush are clueless`\Kyle Singler looks like [Kenneth](http://www.nndb.com/people/957/000163468/jack-mcbrayer-1-sized.jpg) from 30 rock.`\Oh totally 2/10 would not bang. Dude she was hot as fuck`\As good as Westbrook is, sometimes the individual assets are better than the sum of all parts. In my opinion, Westbrook is not the right PG to pair with Durant.

The Spurs team is actually perfect for this illustration because LaMarcus Aldridge, a star in his own right, was and is more than willing to fit in and play within the system even if his individual stats will go down.

Durant needs a PG with this mentality and I don't think Westbrook will ever be that type of player. He has that alpha male personality which isn't a bad thing, it just doesn't work well when you have another top 5 player in the league on your team.

That being said, the Raptors (my favourite team) are OKC-lite in terms of how they execute their offence. Kyle Lowry and Demar DeRozan taking turns at ISO so I can't really criticize that much.`\JVG is such a thunder fan lol `\Livingston is one draugr looking mofo`\When we move the damn ball we look really good. `\theyre 3/8 this quarter`\WHAT THE FUCKING FUCK!!!!!`\"Here Seattle, you can have this back..."`\Not even close for me`\What if waiters comes back and shoots lights out for the rest of the season because of his brother?`\���� `\lewd`\Mmmm Beverley bricking the last shot pleases me as much as the win.`\How scary would it be if at the last second he stared right into the camera with a crazy look on his face?`\35 REVERSE`\curry way too cold.`\GSW has done to OKC what they did to LAC.


Warriors just have to break Spurs now as they broke Cleveland with a Finals win/regular season blowout combo punch. `\Looking pretty good now. Dudes a maniac in the open court `\Yeah some pretty weak calls `\Westbrook looks like he's trying to run a 40 out there lol`\Old Man Pierce.`\Seems weird people do this on r/nba - on r/nfl its only bandwagon teams/fans who do this shit to opposing teams but on r/nba its like every gamethread this happens`\This is too savage`\you're a mavs fan. you don't get an opinion`\Dang, like any bench production worth a damn and we could have had this game.  Still hard to be too upset when Giannis and Jabari play like that.`\Really Foye? Guy charging towards you and you don't try to take the charge or defend in any way?`\Wow, this game makes me realize how much I don't miss Kanter.`\Beaseley checks in, scores points, checks out. That's good basketball right there.`\Get some tips from Bogut.`\Apparently he's 40`\Weird seeing that commercial for Roosterteeth's movie.`\But you need to reply to every message`\Wait a minute....

Isn't the scouting report on the Thunder to let them have a lead?`\wtf was Westbrook thinking that was aweful`\Westbrook wtf are you doing with that much time`\I CALLED GAME!!`\Nah everybody in the world has kids. No matter how weird or antisocial you are. Unless you're like a /r/childfree person

If I had seen the thread/post before I wouldn't have brought it up - being nasty as shit doesn't help in any way whatsoever.

I appreciate the assholishness. Now I know not to ask about OKC

There's no way he's complaining about his foul`\Apparently I don't know the rules of basketball.`\Adams is a fucking badass, and his mustache makes him at least 10 times more badass. You're playing yourself.`\[Guardzilla](https://streamable.com/c3c1)`\OKC gifted free throws late in a game? What a shock that is.`\Speights the splash cousin`\no way we're gonna close out with the current "offense" we're running`\I previously said balance of calls were in OKC favor. It's at least even at this point.`\I LOVE 4TH QUARTERS!!!!!!!!!!!`\2 heartbreak in 1 week, unbelievable.`\curry ends it there on his fourth three`\I'm confused he's not that old?`\Hey wtf stop down voting flair`\Yeah well you can enjoy a pleasant dinner consisting of your own feces. Good evening.`\The yellow bars show how many timeouts each team has. When the bonus is showing  it means that tram gets two free throws every time they're fouled whether they are shooting or not.`\He's a quick jumper too.  Doesn't take him long to get up to his apex. `\Aldridge looked like he was on a trampoline`\perfect?`\Curry should be taking more shots, he's too unselfish for his own good`\Wish Van Gundy was here to call these refs out `\Less often than he yells "AND1" and doesn't even clank rim. `\I was finishing the copy pasta don't crucify me pwease`\KD set that whole play up. Beautiful.`\Fuck, c'mon.`\Jazz keep pissing away chances `\Is shabazz our only NBA player on our bench right now?
`\The sooner Favors realizes he's not a good jump shooter the better.`\Exactly the sort of thing someone who supports a bad team would believe.`\Lol did you not watch Russ all game?`\[DION with the crucial intervention](https://streamable.com/orff)`\What happened to the defense?`\Hand up, man down! `\We fired him for this pathetic excuse for a coach.`\That was nasty Cousins`\Gah! I'm still pissed about Morrow's blown layup`\something something death by snu-snu`\FUCK KEVIN HART`\Westbrook you fucking idiot`\You realize the spurs had all their starters out this game right?`\Oh god... I'm cracking up. Did you see that play drawing.`\SPLASH!`\Calls are really going the Warriors way in the 4th.`\I'd say 1-5 is locked.`\40 wins!`\Singler is what I imagine I'd play like if it was my first ever game in the NBA`\I have no idea why they let him roll to the basket uncontested like that.`\35 REVERSE 35 REVERSE`\Its just a good Thunder run man. Plenty of game left. `\Omri..?`\Its improved considerably from his rookie season from an abysmal 15% so he has shown he can improve his shot. I would love it if he could get that up to 30% next season.`\We need to adopt OKC's approach - just rush the rim repeatedly. Refs will hand out FT's aplenty. `\this is going to be nuts. hyped!`\You gotta be fucking kidding me? He is so criminally underrated. He might be a top 10 defensive player in the NBA`\Yup hate his fuckn face`\OH SHIT FTSSSS!!!`\I'll take it`\You're complaining?`\Some people call him the Speights Cowboy/Some call him the gangster of love/Some people call him Marreese/'cause he speaks of the pompitous of love.

edit for the full lyrics.`\OUR PROBLEMS AREN'T AS HIGHLIGHTED ANYMORE! `\Mcgary!! `\well.... WB really set the tone with no ball movement`\The bench isn't too bad sometimes, it's just the way it's being used. Kanter-Morrow-Payne-Waiters can be pretty good. `\I'm not a fan of the black headbands. `\lol like every thunder comment starts off downvoted`\Holy shit I really like the Minnesota core. They are gonna be so dangerous in the coming years. `\I'm starting to transition from anger to pity regarding Danny's shooting situation. I kinda feel bad for the dude. `\Green make your free throws.`\Singler has been so good at ripping down offensive boards lately `\Why do we need Luc when we got Defensive Player of the Year Wesley Johnson`\need one more DAGGER`\do you mind uploading this last westbrook shot everyone is talking about`\I think his point is that Durant should be setting examples as a leader of this team and he has been making turnovers lately. The whole team has and its a problem. KD has also had games where is is very lacksidasical off the ball, in transistion, and on D. Yes, he's the best player. Yes, he scores the most points. But you have a team of roleplayers around you and you are the leader. He needs to be crisp with cuts and getting open. He needs to get back on defense instead of crying and acting butthurt. He needs to be the one who holds people accountable for turnovers by leading with example. You cant blame him solely for losses obviously, but he isnt the victim here. He may not have flawless games, but his effort should be flawless. `\Yea it must also suck to actually have a team

I'm talking to the thunder guy not u I know how you feel not having a team and stuff `\He's gaurding a 6 foot 10 guy and he's only 6 foot 4. Not much he can do.`\unacceptable`\I don't want to face OKC in the playoffs.`\Shabazz singlehandedly dragging this unit to a somewhat respectable +/-`\KAT what a move!`\Goddamn it. Why does that final play not surprise me? It's either a fucking ridiculous shot at the end or no shot at all.`\Greens been yelling at refs all night, surprised no tech`\I cried`\Set em up and you knock em right down.`\Lakers up 18 vs Warriors. Wut`\I'm just surprised that the childrens' barber has a bowl big enough for his head.  `\Same. I'm not emotional about NBA as I am about NFL/college basketball and football, that's where my bad side comes out. In fact I'm banned from /r/CollegeBasketball for going over the line at an IU fan, I'm a Purdue fan. `\Glad to see you Wolve fans have quit bitching about calls.`\So cracked.com thinks disney is marketing zootopia to furries. I kinda see it after that commercial.`\Is this our best offensive game yet?`\I hope this happens in S6, Boltons are awful!! :'(`\Our bench might actually be cancer.`\Naah Casper tripped him`\KD 6/17, KD getting kawhi'd.

Kawhi 6/17, Kawhi getting kawhi'd `\Not being ugly, but will they ever be?  It seems like every year we expect them to take that step and they never do`\Only on ABC`\Chubby Mo hit a three... this game is over.`\Blouses`\wow missed it until now`\Lowry clearly needs rest... I find it rather odd that he still plays 36 minutes when they are down by 20 for half the game. `\That passing is awesome. `\I dunno, generally dislike of a player comes from saltsaltsalt.
Coz nothing KD did then was even close to "bitch" like`\Every OKC fan just had a flashback to that GSW game lol`\It's a choke because we absolutely have the talent to be closing out these games`\Nothing hidden about my contempt for the most overrated player in NBA history.`\Keep leaving Speights open. `\They had 2. Sorry, this was my first time doing anything like this. i'm trying to avoid doing homework. I didn't think the 2 was a big deal to be honest, so I didn't put it. A third of OKC's rebounds were offensive, so i thought that deserved an side note. I'll makes sure to put it for both teams if I do this again.`\Westbrook is playing like a 2k12 my player`\Ughhhhhhh that last 3 attempt by Wes. Hit every part of that rim and didn't go in. Tears`\Pretty quiet 33 points honestly.`\http://imgur.com/m876wJR`\He is so dirty `\Foye's man just completely double teamed Durant and Durant decided not to even look Foye's way at all.  Can't blame him`\The refs.`\I understand why Harden threw that pass but it was a little risky`\I wouldn't underestimate the clips whether they're fourth against the warriors or third against the spurs`\Wtf just happened `\Pretty sure that's just ABC`\why the fuck is the PA guy shouting during the game

e: im an idiot`\That 3rd quarter was quiet. But he was stellar otherwise`\I feel like it would hurt more knowing that and still lose`\horrible ass 2nd quarter for us... Well atleast compared to the first quarter lol `\How is that a foul on a shot attempt?`\WB was not happy`\I wouldn't have expected anything less`\Glimpse of the future tonight! Wolves have to be excited for their core to mature.`\Green and Parker are 0/12 and it's a 2 point game. Lmao this is crazy`\Racist against... White European guys? Intriguing theory. I'll take it. `\That's no foul but Ibaka also needs to take care of that a lot easier`\Warriors reach in all the time and never get called. Just like how Draymond never gets as many techs as he deserves. `\Why?`\OH SHIT ALDRIDGE`\why don't you blame him for putting singler in at the first place. All stats say that our team is much better with morrow off the bench instead of singler. `\[Harden no look lob lead](https://streamable.com/whjh)`\People will be quick to blame Harden for this one, but this is on JB. Why Corey Brewer got as many crunch time minutes as he did is beyond me. Inexcusable.`\perfect then`\I dunno, but I'm pretty sure you're a disgrace to this sub.`\Congrats Giannis`\Speak for yourself, that's hardly a consensus opinion. `\Billy's secrit plays`\Part of it is bad luck.  Part of it is Singler has 0 touch around the basket.  `\:3`\Turning into TD`\Here we go!!!!`\This is destined to be another heartbreaker for OKC. `\NO BLAKE NO PROBLEM`\I have never seen a player make jumpers from long range as smooth as Curry. Wow!`\About as satisfied as you are with Westbrook 20 misses!`\It's not pressure, it's intelligence. They have a way that they like to play, offensively and defensively. That's why, for instance, the Cavs looked pretty comfortable against them. LeBron pretty much has their defense in a book`\I hate those fouls `\Durant is having such a good shooting night. I'm surprised he only has 24 points`\Already got a guy tagged to eat shit if he loses, either way I'll be happy`\It's directed from the franchise that "Thunder" is singular.

See, I just said it and it didn't seem weird.

Some people hate it. Particularly when they say "The Thunder *is* playing well/shitty".

EDIT: "TEAM IS ONE" was a media phrase in commercials/billboards/print. A play off that. It's intentional. `\Because it wasn't a shooting foul and not the bonus?`\right? it's not that fucking serious.... either he has some legit anger issues or he's just a typical NBA fake tough guy....`\Can we talk about how fucking weird Donovan's lineups are `\Because our defense is crazy inconsistent and is laughable at times. And because playing both dion and randy foye 20+ a night is something that happens now`\okc getting all kind of calls`\Shit guys, finish this game`\I believe the scholars of old call it oppicissm`\It's a shame you'll never get as far as we did last year before KD and Russ leave.`\I know it honestly just creates laziness.`\WTF Russ?`\umm..`\Following this Thunder team is like having a really hot girl lead you and flirt with you...and then getting rejected. `\Alright something has to change because the wheels are really starting to come off this thing. I mean why are Payne, Morrow and McGary just wasting away on the bench while we completely fall apart on the court? It's not like they're going to fuck anything up more then it already is.`\These refs, these fucking refs`\At least Foye can play some semblance of defense though. Augustin was my most hated player on this team ever. `\He acted the dick in his last year with us, has said nothing good about the Thunder since he left, told one of our fans to suck his dick, started antagonising players tonight after he barely won a game when the team was resting KD and Serge.

I like the Pistons. Love SVG. Just dont like Reggie Jackson.`\Everybody besides Leonard/Duncan/Aldridge is 3-18 from the field ughhhh`\If we need anyone to fuse it's Morrow and Roberson so we can get the perfect starting 2`\No need for a sub Donovan you're doing great...`\Westbrook just stop`\the game plan for the thunder seems to be make steph play defense for 48 minutes`\had all day!`\Ikr I'm here in NZ and my only stake besides loving the thunder is Steven Adams. `\Still think he is tbh`\I'm not saying you aren't a capable offensive team. You put one of Westbrook or Durant on the floor at all times and its going to be difficult to have a bad offense.`\Everyone is acting like the Wolves just got fucked there, but it's the Thunder who got fucked

We just fucking lost a bucket because these refs are idiots`\He's been so frustratingly bad at times this year. Sometimes he does shit that is just makes no sense.

A few games ago, he grabbed a loose ball, and had someone super open right beside him, but instead of passing to him, he tried lobbing it to Durant (I think it was KD, at least). And it was an *awful* attempt at a lob. He pretty much passed it directly to whoever was guarding KD`\49-33, we are. `\Deandre is not playing well`\OHMYGOD SINGLER ALMOST DIED`\As a clips fan I am still sitting here wondering how Green didn't get a technical for the way he was behaving.`\Yay we didn't collapse in the 4th! Go thunder `\Well, Raptors just being outplayed here...`\I think you should expect for people to be annoyed if you come into a game thread you aren't a part of with the sole intention to gloat about playoff seeds. And you insult the other team too? What did you expect?

But yeah, I'm sure a lot of Celtics fans would do the same thing.`\and chris johnson, joe ingles and trey lyles

towel=thrown

(notably absent: any of the top 8 rotation players)`\There we go!`\Have they had any reviews this game?  This is the first game in a long time with no reviews.`\Wiggins with the game winner `\wtf is Jeff doing?`\There it is!

Still want him to get to 20 assists, though`\That was so careless of Curry`\BIG BOSS SINGLER TRYING TO GET THAT PER UP NICE`\Speights having a good game`\Livingston gets the foul but Foye didn't, aight.`\No lol. OKC doesnt have a chance. Spurs on the other hand....`\Cam you gotta find Morrow on that one.`\OKC just turnt`\I bet you $0.72 he plays in the fourth. `\False`\[This](http://puu.sh/nEBSJ/283010afb8.png) is his performance this month. Besides the Bulls game, he's been awful for a starting PG on the second best team in the league. I'm not a hater, he's really been awful for a while. `\On pace for a Wilt stat line.`\Man I swear if any other player complained like Draymond Green it would be a technical 9/10 times`\Looking at the thunder bench is like looking in at a suspect line in a police station. You have the frat boy rapist in Kyle Singler, and down the line you have the serial rapist in Steven Adams `\I'll plaster him on my ceiling. ;)`\I'm now imagining a priest splashing holy water on Booker :/`\James Young cant even dribble the ball properly`\Had a couple good defensive sequences, hit a three. He's looking really good `\Says I have to click the link from comment page. What the hell does that even mean. I wanna watch the game so I clicked on stream link but it won't let me `\Let Aldridge cook.
`\*Playoff Waiters* is only a few games away...`\3/13 wow.  Also I dont think that was a foul on Ibaka.`\Are the Thunder the disgrace of the league???`\the warriors are a good team`\26`\Are these dogs even real???? i have never seen dogs do that kind of stuff!!!`\ZzzZzZZzzzzz`\We need buckets....

We have a guy shooting like 60% from the field.

\>better not give him the ball. `\As a guard I must confess I always crossed in front of opposition when I'm taking the ball down. For some reason, when I fell, refs always called the found on them.`\We've kind of collapsed lately... thoughts on why? Idk if it's adjustments or what?`\Seriously, who does he think he is? You ain't Steph Curry bro. For real I was pretty upset that he gave away a chance to tie with that bs. We needed OT!`\When the refs decided it golden state losing their home winning streak was too close for comfort. `\Murder`\Singler putting the team on his back`\no names missing lay ups and shit lmao`\Lmao Ibaka`\KD just went from the 3 point line without a dribble and laid it up O_O. `\He may be injured and doesnt trust himself to drive`\Warriors fans can't say they don't have a great overall team.`\Probably trying to draw a foul. No way a ref calls that at that time though. Bad play regardless.`\It takes everything. *Everything*.`\Dreadful call on Adams. `\If Dwight had his stickum he woulda caught that`\he's been practicing shooting for a bit now, he says he's "close" but that could mean anything. `\K4444 D44444`\I loved Steven Adams in There Will Be Blood.`\awful shot selection by westbrook`\Am I missing something or have a lot of these recent fouls against OKC been highly questionable?`\U da real MVP man.`\Why do you post this shit? Dion is just a streaky bench player but Singler is the worst.`\I think that stuff is funny too. My all-time favorite /r/nbacirclejerk post is the one that was posted the night we lost game 7 to the Clips, titled "Tonight, class has died". Just seemed kinda unnecessary to put it in the title. Mods are probably going to remove that one now.`\I'm down with it.`\I have no clue why brew is in the game right now. Put D-Mo or Beas in for the love of Christ`\He's been complaining a bit more lately `\True but we also get more from our 6th, 7th, 8th, 9th players
`\Dion's ability to get to the rim is tier 1. my man has so many hesitations and head fakes, then just explodes.`\KD communicating is that what I am seeing? WOAH`\I like 35 reverse.`\okc will shoot themselves out of this game`\Don't worry, it's natural. Toronto sports kinda really has a way of harshly making you retreat towards that mentality. People might think we are tongue-in-cheek about our pessimism... nope, absolutely not.`\people will look at the box score and will think that WB had a chuck fest but he really just missed aLOT of open shots`\120-90`\Raptors and Clippers didn't get blown out either (and the Spurs didn't have Duncan)`\I just didn't see people posting that. I didn't see people really posting that in the game thread either.

What I did see from their fan's were variations of "I need this", "the Thunder need this game". `\What? It's not like I put it there, it was OP`\Real scrappy gym rat kind of guy`\Woooooooow`\But what about us...? Lmao who am I kidding I hope we can beat the Mavs. `\Iggy for Secretary of Veteran Affairs`\[relevant](https://twitter.com/Money23Green/status/63449644105072640?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)`\Fuck baseball. It's boring as shit. We need football back. `\The Warriors are basically like a football team with Tom Brady throwing to Antonio Brown, Odell Beckham, Julio Jones and Gronk, handing it off to Adrian Peterson and Le'Veon Bell, all while having the Broncos defense.  They're absurd.  It will be one of the biggest chokes in the history of sports if they don't win the finals this year.`\Thunder are getting hot at the right time`\Fuck Kanter.`\I wanted to keep him for like 12MM-13MM a year to come off the bench and feast on second units. His lack of passing wouldn't have mattered and his offensive game would have been great. But obviously none of that matters since...

A. He got the max

B. He didn't want to come off the bench for us and made that clear by requesting the trade.`\every pass is a little too hot when you're Aron Baynes`\oh man Kawhi got a KD call, holy fuck`\i need that wb crossover on beverly on replay pls he touched the earth man`\I hate everyone on the clippers.

Except JJ. He is amazing`\KD's body language is a lot different today, I think he wants to sit out the 4th, tryin to get this over with.`\The Bastardry of Bogut `\Kevin Durant is a better scorer than TMac. KD most the most points 5 straight years, and there's no reason to think he wouldn't have last year if he didn't get hurt. `\Last game against golden state - went the last shot - Dion Waiters, -18

This game - 4 point game - Dion Waiters, -18

TAKE A FUCKING HINT BILLY`\KD :(`\Durant.....dude......wtf`\Can't wait to play you, Warriors. Hopefully we can show up 3 times.`\Didn't watch the game, only saw the boxscore, why was Westbrook shooting so much? If he was missing and durant was making his shots, why keep letting Westbrook shoot? 8/24 and 1/8 from three yeesh`\Westbrook and Jackson have both been awful`\Not until Roberson hits a 3`\Good half so far `\Max contract Barnes`\Ugh 3 for Gobert. We'll have to win this game with him on the bench a lot of the time I guess`\Please no overtime, I need to go to the gym :/`\You guys bitter as fuck`\It's not like we got much say in the move or anything, we just stayed loyal to the team`\That's why Westbrook was missing so much. He didn't have his right forearm.`\thought it was KD and Acy`\Ricky Rubio hits the game winning jumper, wow.`\Man, if Johnson had made that 3rd 3pter in a row . . .`\Why doesn't anthony morrow gets minutes is he a james jones?`\I agree but luckily I don't think that affects KD like it might others as much.`\The Nets and Kings also have great announcers`\Doc about to get a fine - "I don't see why we get a tech when the ref blows a call." Lol.`\Thunder leading into the fourth. How much do they lose by?`\[Fadawaiters](https://streamable.com/mgg3)`\How do you call a delay of game when the ball is in play?`\damn deep`\yea but if he wanted to let him go, he would have put no force on his arm and the foot of Cousins would have move his arm just enough to go away :) `\Ball movement and effort? What?`\CHUCK FOR PRESIDENT 2016`\you're right. my bad.`\lol thats dumb`\oh my lord.`\God I hope we play well, we've been horrible in the fourth quarter all year`\The turnovers are a major problem, and I think it might actually be getting worse.`\Feel sorry for the Sacramento fans, they're stuck in the grey area of too good to make the lottery and not good enough to make the playoffs. `\IF YOU DONT LIKE ISO, THEN YOU DONT LIKE OKC BASKETBALL!!! WOOOO!!!!`\Bogut has always been solid offensively. He just doesn't need to score. He moves the ball like everyone else.`\Players.  Too much hero ball when it is unnecessary.`\I didn't want him to monetize it, like pay, just accept BTC donations passively. Not watermarking or self promoting or anything.`\Almost three triple doubles in one match. Almost two in the same team. Damn!`\Why won't he wear a shooter's sleeve? `\Fuck^The^Warriors`\RUBIO 2016`\playoff race.

 This ain't church, fella`\Kevin Durant just missing out on the elusive quadruple double.`\Besides the turnovers Durant played really well`\C'mon guys, you're just letting Thomas walk to the basket`\He is their Draymond.`\Real worried about hardens ankle. Not like we can afford to rest him even a game though. Dude is our entire offense and like half a game separates the 6 and 8 seed.`\dion is lit`\CP3 trusted the shit out of JJ on that last fastbreak play.`\Dray shouldve gotten a tech. that is a VERY lenient ref.`\Durant is blowing this game.`\I've seen all the Spurs championships. Never have I recalled them being bailed out other than suspending Amare, but thanks to the Malice, that's what was handed down `\Howard to me is average to below average on defense. If he is not dunking or getting an easy rebound he looks disengaged. `\exhibit #397 why people hate Warriors fans this season holy shit`\Lol nah the way you spelled it was better. Reminded me of geraffes`\Iggy is a flopper`\Wtf is this half time performance`\aight boys we winning this. Speights has started his routine.`\Thunder in "keep the lead" mode instead of attack mode I've seen quite a few times lately late in games. But I'm not sure if LAC can capitalize like GS.`\These refs make me wanna die and I'm a neutral fan`\DUBS SO LUCKY`\Enjoy watching KD in a Thunder uniform boys, no way he is staying with this dumpster fire...
`\So many Asians in the lower bowl.  Makes me think I should be a Dubs fan.`\This is beautiful`\Yup,same problem.
EDIT:It's back :)
`\https://streamable.com/e8ib`\Manu is back... Also Anderson has basically absorbed strangler minutes last couple of games and now with Kmart, there's no time for him `\damn singler`\We all shit on Curry's pubey beard but damn Russ please shave`\CURRY 3`\Would it actually be possible to have people inside that house on the back of a truck? Would be kind of fun `\I only eat Tuna subs from there and they've always been decent and good to me. `\He didn't even make contact`\KD WHO ARE YOU RIGHT NOW?!?!?!?`\I switched from beer to tanquray. Kept my cool and just expected the loss, hoping to be surprised.`\But mostly threes `\> Yeah looking back, Magic-Lakers was such a let down when we could have had LeBron vs Kobe both in their respective primes. If only...

Those damn Muppet's had me so psyched for an epic finals showdown. Instead, we damn near got a sweep. `\Where's everyone at?`\This is why we don't want the 6th seed.`\Haven't been told yet`\Losing to the pistons can bring out the best in some teams :)`\Okay Waiters is having one of those game, give it to him `\Westbrook is a straight up liability on defense right now`\westbrook's euro steps defy the laws of physics`\The refs don't like Dion. `\Really, Russ?`\> Is Monty the real coach or something?

too soon`\[Russ behind back to Ibaka](https://streamable.com/75pa)`\It's Karl`\Why do they call that shit`\Good thing it's an even year`\You can't win a game by going into the lane and then waiting for the whistle to blow. Gotta make buckets.`\It's a gift :/`\i'm surprised the game is this close`\Could go that way. You guys have been playing well lately. Leaving AAA with a W would be big for Charlotte tomorrow.`\I wondered why Kawhi wasn't getting the same calls as westbrook when they're both driving and i think its just speed.  the refs call it when its faster cuz they're not sure or something.`\Holy shit there's still 5 minutes left. Fan like you are so fucking annoying. `\What's our return `\said the guy watching an online stream`\I feel bad that Brooks took so much flack - it absolutely wasn't his fault`\he will forever be our YAM`\That is pretty interesting`\All this passing is just great to watch.`\It's a marvel when it doesn't work.`\The subreddit is big enough that no matter what we do, we're going to alienate someone but in that instance it was a no-brainer. Also please don't try to monetize you're awesome content on the subreddit as other users have suggested, I've got no real problem with it per say but it would force our hand somewhat :(`\jamal crapford and cp always fucking flopping it pisses me off`\Looks like it`\Draymond you have enough T's stop please`\holy fuck Speights Cowboy is a contender for GOAT nickname`\Westbrook wasn't good tonight. B2B, I know. Still, he never found a rhythm.`\Or he could fall short `\i'm one`\Just a bad pass. There was no one inbetween Dwight and the hoop`\Westbrook is so bad today. Seems like all he's doing is taking pull up jumpers and trying to get to the line.`\Westbrook is hurting OKC so much with these bad shots `\Never stop shooting, Mo.`\foye is literally a traffic cone on D`\KCP stinks at offense.`\ARE YOU FUCKING SERIOUS OMG WHAT A FUCKING GARBAGE CALL `\even still dwight could have caught that, he looked so unathletic on that jump`\Parker gonna finish in double figures from FTs`\Very true. I just have a bad feeling about beating a team as good as OKC for a third time in a row UNLESS we get a strong game from one or 2 other players then Curry`\Durant is just destroying this team on both sides of the ball`\Man KD is so damn efficient `\Upvote for Ellen`\Even shorter version: $$$$$$$$$. They had 'em, and the league wanted 'em.`\Cousins is balling the fuck out tonight. That dude is a nightmare to stop`\FINALLY!!!!`\you guys been playing better without blake right? and you still have 3 great players out there with Paul, Jordan, and Reddick `\westbrook with the pickup game defense lol`\He's hit hit 3 contested fade away shots...`\thats how you beat okc right?`\rip momentum`\Yeah, I like foye sometimes off the ball, but he should not be our back up point. `\Russ looks like Donatello from ninja turtles `\Surprised they ruled that off Harden given the precedent they've been setting.

Also surprised that wasn't a foul I guess.`\Relax, the refs won this game`\True lol.

KD scores on you - Damn, but you can live with that.

Singler scores on you - you won't stop hearing about it until the offseason`\TD is 5-5 from the field. bailing us out man`\please go away`\Basketball gods hate WB `\stop giving them ideas.`\More like 2012 playoffs `\http://m.imgur.com/gallery/B5oibC6

Unreal by DJ`\Lol OKCs record vs. 500+ teams on ESPN has gone to shit because Utah, Houston, and Dallas have all dropped under 500...

I miss Boris's shot.`\What they do is more unique than most life-saving surgeons.  They're more elite, and they get paid accordingly.  Their paycheques are drawn from you and I, because they produce - in combination with the NBA's owners and partners - a fantastic product that we're willing to spend our hard-earned money on.  This is not a public expense that is up for debate among citizens.  They get paid what their market value demands.  That's inherently fair.`\Why does Aldridge make those against us.

Can confirm.`\I honestly don't hate him anywhere near as much some of our fellow fans.  I don't hate him whatsoever for his play and what he gave us.  I hate what he said after the fact.

He didn't do that though...`\Fat Lever?!!`\Because of all their salt towards Enes the Menace.`\I honestly believe this team is built for the playoffs not so much for the regular season.  I pick them as second best when it comes to the playoffs.  `\Well they executed pretty well (until near the end) but they were just missing open shot after shot. Defensively they were decent`\Donovan needs to be fired, his lineups and lack of adaptation in this game alone should be proof of that.`\Lmfao. You sound foolish. You came from the Sonics as we came from the Braves. Neither of our teams have done anything`\Westbrook probably wants Rivers to guard him every game`\Yup`\I hope it's the refs. `\It's good for getting the NBA to change the loophole faster.`\I feel like every time I notice Singler lately it is because he is playing "great" defense.

Durant torched GS as usual but OKC needs both at their best to compete with this squad `\Yknow what, I was impressed with what the thunder did defensively this game.

East was long overdue though, good timing and lots of growing teams starting to come together.`\We can't be starting JV and Scola together man, too much of a defensive liability. `\His slump has lasted so long`\but tonight hes instant offense`\just another thunder 4th quarter, nothing to see here`\Good point, didn't think that one through`\Refs giving Durant more free throws`\I agree, I don't like it either but I think most fans do enjoy it.  `\These foul calls are starting to get ridiculous.

Edit 3: Thanks!  I think its working now!`\I can't count. Can someone do it for me?`\Giannis was looking swole today btw. With that haircut and now the muscles he looks like a mixture of KD and Westbrook. `\a very good friend of mine is a Boston fan, and I hope for her sake you guys beat them in GS. That first game was unreal.`\[Whey!](http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m6txdkkARy1r6woc9o1_500.gif)`\Why do we hate the Jazz again? The rockets, without a doubt.`\WELL that could've gone better.`\There was once in the 2nd quarter, where he just stood there on a rebound, and a Rockets player (Ariza, I think) ended up getting it and scoring. It was so damn frustrating.

Also, Westbrook started out like he was trying to do more than necessary. Probably because of Beverly, but at least he's settled down. There were also a few times where he's had a lane to the basket, but instead of shooting, he'd pass it. `\rofl of course we blow it on defense

`\Man I really hope we can hang on to Kanter this offseason as much as we have worry about Durant.
Edit: NVM; I'm dumb`\In case this is serious, a triple double is when a player gets double-digits in three different stat categories.  I.e. 10+ points, 10+ rebounds, 10+ assists.  The other two stat categories are steals and blocks.  There have only been a few quadruple doubles in NBA history, and no quintuple doubles.`\Beverly getting worked by Westbrook out there `\yeah, i'm sure somebody fouled him but dwight easily could've been called at the other end`\If you're gonna fire the coach that was with the team for 7 years or whatever, you'd think they want to get a good one`\Cut curry what a shit last shot`\Mo Buckets is the next best thing the nba has, after steph curry`\This game almost had 3 triple-doubles. Has that ever happened in a game before?!`\\#allIcareaboutisNik`\KD padding his stats haha`\save us jae`\Ya you can tell he's hurting `\the Austin Spurs`\Parker is 0/3 and Green is 0/6. Manu ended the half with a turnover, because of course.`\He's not.`\Curry is gonna get 50`\I have no stats, but it seems like in past years, even last year, we figured it out. This year is different. `\Bogie!!!`\Chokeholma... damn. Yall need Reggie Miller`\Shot like 12/25 or whatever it was`\Got a great streak, what should I do? Maybe make us lose it! BD is great everything is okay`\Our bench and bench's bench put up 90 points on a healthy Thunder squad (Green had 2), KD and WB had to be played for 32 & 34 minutes, and we were leading after one quarter and part of another......uhm, positives?`\lmao did boogie gain 20 pounds when he went back to the locker room`\this commercial sucks imo think about the epicness that they could have made with these players`\Thunder absolutely lost without KD.`\MO SPEIGHTS GOAT `\Kevin Durant: 9 TO, 2nd most this season

Might wanna run it again.`\Wtf are you talking about?

That only happened with vinnie del negro ... Doc is his biggest supporter and helped made DJ who he is.`\It was kinda ridiculous. Twist wasn't even good, like at all. I think he has like 2 career points. All he did was come out, fight someone then get thrown out. I have met him a couple times though, and he seems like a pretty nice dude. It's crazy they paid someone a ton of money to get in fights a couple times a month though. Almost every team had a player like him too, he would usually beat their asses too lol. He had a brutal right hand.

Seriously, google his fight vs. Rob Ray. Dudes cheek bones were like soft and floppy up under his skin. It was disgusting. `\have you watched his defense on KD so far?`\Holy fuck refs. `\Worse was when he just became a pouty locker room cancer and intentionally played like a ball stopping lazy piece of crap tanking his trade value for us.`\Deandre rifles it into the 4th row, while on a 180 lunge, then yells at his teamates.

Deandre adc player confirmed. Vayne player to be exact `\WESTBROOK IS THE MOST RETARDED PLAYER IN THE WORLD`\Or Donovan just isn't that great of a coach either.  Would you be saying the same thing about the Warriors if they still had Mark Jackson as their coach and never got past the second round?`\Harrison Barnes for Senator`\xD I have a fan, you're +35 for me

Plus I have you tagged as 'MVP'`\Lowry 3-11 christ

Give the ball to Norman see what he can do`\Lol Gorgui wtf?`\I didn't like the manu iso with almost the whole thunder team in the paint and a turnover. Also the wild passes. I think they got this though. `\sure we wave at him all the time`\He's 0-5. `\Did you catch Westbrook and Beverley high five about the end right before showing Trevor Ariza walking to the tunnel?

Tough i know lots of trolls do. `\Adams if you can survive getting beaten up by your sister you can walk this injury off`\What an incredible pass by Wiggins. `\Westbrook crosses the shit out of Beverly on his way to the rim. Howard jumps late and there is massive contact. No call? `\I'll pass on the offer, thanks though.

Series aren't decided by one game. You're making excuses. You're just too upset to admit it. You guys have nothing to prove anything. You guys choked a fucking 3-1 series lead over Houston last year, how you gonna spin that?

Looking at the schedule for the Raps, it's a seriously tough road to end the regular season with the only sub 0.500 teams being NYK and PHI. Hawks twice, Pacers, Spurs, Hornets.

At the rate our team had been drinking it up these last two weeks, I say pack it in and rest DD and Kyle. They're gassed and it shows badly. `\You are the one Clipper fan I like. `\warriors getting sloppy`\Fatty Speights always lights up against us`\Really? I find him to be the most entertaining clipper off the bench.`\Well, I mean, what?

You're talking about another game, so I figured I'd also say something that I find awesome from another game.

Cleveland losing is nice, but so was Curry struggling.`\Credit to OKC, but holy shit the refs of this game need to be fired. The officiating was complete fucking garbage. Last game that had this many bullshit techs was the Clippers Cavs game with Lauren Holtkamp.`\Layup duel of the century, Dion Waiters vs Austin Rivers.`\IS THAT TOO SHORT`\Why take that shot?

I like this new plan. `\WOOOOOOWW`\I'm glad Westbrook made that and got the foul, but it was still so sloppy looking.

Harden had a great game but two bad turnovers down the stretch (including that ill-advised lob at the end). Crazy that this could be a first round matchup, or the Rockets could miss out on the playoffs entirely at this point.

A small gripe I have is I really don't like the NBA advancement rules. Rockets did a great job denying the Thunder for 6 seconds in the backcourt and forced a timeout. Then they deny the inbounds really well and force OKC to take their last timeout and that puts OKC in the frontcourt (no longer in danger of the 8 second past halfcourt rule). Would have liked for them to have forced them to inbound from the backcourt again. `\Klay what was that`\who's hitting the game winning 37 footer? `\You call this an implosion?

Child please `\Is this another one we're gonna "take the stat sheet and wipe our asses with it"?`\I like how the clippers bench stood up until someone made a basket.

At least against GSW.  `\Molereese`\He's the one who's been fucking up`\More like Choke-K-C.`\Young and weak defensive tendencies most likely. Too much reaching, getting stuck behind picks.

Let's just agree that the pacers don't get to make the playoffs.`\By end of the game, the warriors probably win by 4`\watching Waiters every night must be so frustrating`\Fuck they're gonna be mad tomorrow. `\the thunder are doing bad but the refs start calling it so heavy for the warriors late. Someone is even close to steph's space and they call a foul. `\I expected something like this... I get where you're coming from. I'm being ridiculous for being upset at a top 5 team in the league.

For me, this year was finals or bust. In my head we need to prove to KD that his best chance for a championship is staying here. With the way they've played post all-stars, I'm not allowed to be frustrated?`\I have a dream that Lowry makes 2 consecutive free throws`\fix your free throws plz`\DeMar needs to learn what passing is, Lowry needs to learn what an intelligent shot looks like.`\Kanter went for a nice evening jog`\I hope no one gets hurt. This game is chippy. `\hes... something`\communicate you fags`\Crawford with the Draymond Green like pass to Jordan (airball/assist)`\I think people can heal and move on with their lives, but moving on and healing doesn't mean that old wounds can't be re-opened by insensitive comments.

I also think that somethings are sufficiently tragic enough that there is little opportunity for humor other than shock value. Sometimes the payoff just isn't worth the cost, thats why its hard to justify any joke about a genocide or the holocaust. The OKC bombings affected such a large proportion of the city that you have a 1 in 3 chance of telling this joke to an OKC fan who knew someone hurt in the bombing.

To be completely forthright though, while I am not from OKC, I do live in NYC. My Office is literally across the street from the WTC and I still refuse to go into the office on 9/11. I've had to walk down 36 flights of steps recently due to an emergency and its terrifying.

So I have a different perspective on this than most, and I am disappointed more than 600 people upvote this throw away joke that makes light of real people's senseless death.`\He has that recessed jaw/narrow smile look that makes him look like it.`\That was great. What a great dude.`\Waiters personal issues man i'm sad about the news ):`\lol Russ needs to fucking chill, dude is playing with zero patience.`\Not surprised `\[Threeon 'the bomb' Waiters](https://streamable.com/uxy1)`\Honestly as long as we're healthy I think we matchup well against those teams regardless of seeding. Crowder's injury is unfortunate yeah but right now our biggest concern is getting Smart to stop pretending he's a superstar offensive threat.`\My god Westbrook even Reggie is playing better than you.

It's amusing to hear  that he's better than KD. This game is an exact replica of last season. No KD = russ hero ball = loss = no playoffs.

Meanwhile  2 years ago with KD and without RW, KD still had us winning `\LOL thank you
`\...What?`\Id imagine he is pissed after last night also`\I don't know why, but for some reason I do t like Enes Kanter`\MOOOOOO`\I think this game is going to set the record for players yelling "And 1"`\What the fuck Westbrook? This dude's decision making is outrageous `\This team is honestly such a joke sometimes.

Billy Donovan also doesn't know how to use fucking timeouts apparently.`\Says the Rockets fan. `\Drop Foye to the darkest realms of the bench`\Thin krisps or think rips?  `\Called being a clipper`\There is no way they can take that foul out of the game though. If that wasn't a foul, the defender could just hold his arm over the shooter's arms and prevent them from taking any shot. They made it a non-shooting foul, which is the most they could do.`\ROBES damn`\Whoops lol`\Jeff Green where tf did this come from?? He hasn't looked this good since that game against the Heat in 2012 when Jason Terry got baptized `\Lawler's Law in effect now, please God `\gsw.. yall are amazing but we need yall to lose tonight cuz damn.. we tired of having our best season ever and still #2... like wtf`\he kills GSW and GSW doesn't go to their 5 enough to make him pay defensively... we should start kanter against them if we play them int he playoffs`\She walked into a plastic surgeon and went, "just fuck my shit up."`\There's no way speights is actually this good of a 3 pt shooter.`\Another KD turnover. `\GET OUT OF HERE GOOD GOD`\Wait we lost? THE FUCK HAPPENED. WE WERE UP LIKE 20 SOMETHING AT HALF TIME AND I SAID EH I'LL TAKE A QUICK NAP AND SLEPT THROUGH THE GAME. I COME BACK AND WE CHOKED?!?

His legs look a little tired. He got some games off down the stretch last year - could probably use some this year too.`\But it hasn't really, besides how you would expect it to post knee injury and in different coaching schemes`\This defense is embarrassing. Thunder are hardly working to get open shots. Our guys are just standing around `\I dunno, when you call someone a bitch for some reason you sure seem salty`\Damn Bev was wide open.

I would not be surprised if they knocked the cavs out.`\I'm surprised the footage isn't burned`\Not even close`\I think it's just mental.

Livingston missed a dunk straight up and they called a foul purely because "wow an NBA player can't be thag bad, right?"`\Different cores our team has two superstars whereas Spurs and Warriors rely on team ball. Hard to get away from that when the surrounding cast around KD and Westbrook is not that great whereas Spurs and Warriors are both really deep. I think we're the deepest we've been since Harden but we fall apart when they try to play Hero ball. We get away from what has been working. Its been years I'm not sure KD and West can get away from it.`\Conveniently leave out Ibaka and Kanter`\HE CAN'T KEEP GETTING AWAY WITH IT!`\What? Just saw his little interview thing and he seemed cool

Hate the rockets but he seems okay`\DD is getting no calls at all. Getting absolutely hammered with every drive`\Who knows. Other Spurs fans will keep harping on about how he plays 'elite' defense, but tbh whilst his defense is good it by no means is good enough to make up for the egg he lays on offense every single game`\[Trash talk with Danny and the bin](https://streamable.com/z9av)`\HAHA`\Lmao KD low-key tryna go at against Acy`\Why does Westbrook keep shooting 3s???`\wont matter if they lose by double digits`\So many games. He was at the all-star game, gsw vs sas, cavs vs thunder, definitely a couple more. He did a tour of nba arenas last playoffs too, so I saw him about 9 times in 3 weeks last year `\These guys were at the Mavs game so here's that set


[Tonight's half-time entertainment - The XPogo Stunt team](https://streamable.com/ofbl)`\Fun drinking game, have a drink every time he say 'flip'

^^^you ^^^might ^^^die`\Yall have KD and Westbrook regardless of the past no raptor fan should think we're gonna win it in the 4th easily.`\Wesley lol `\Mo "Aaron Rodgers" Speights`\OKC Blunder`\Be wearing a Warriors jersey apparently. `\I've been riding this train for years as an OU fan and now with the Thunder. It's not fun`\not even close.  zeller is the ugliest fucker alive`\yeah cuz losing one game to a team that has 2 top 5 players means we hit a wall. Also we havent been at full strength`\God damn how many times has KD gotten close to a triple double this year? Seems like nearly every game he's within 1/2 rebounds and assists away. `\Did he score a lot last game?`\I mean the Spurs have been doing pretty well so far this season, mostly due to elite defense where Danny contributes greatly....`\Durant bites on *every* pump fake..`\I kinda like it when Westbrook and Durant aren't on the court together.

And strangely enough the Thunder are always doing good up until the end of the game when both of them are on the court together trying to close the game out

I think only one of them on the court really shows how great the two are as playmakers, and that's probably why it's so hard to close out games. You have two playmakers looking to make plays for the other playmaker.
 `\absolutely amazing D there. good job thunder`\Durant was trying to curry with that shot`\WTF shoot it Ibaka`\I guess if Durant is going to have half of his shots be 3s (even when he isn't making them), it's best to do it when you're up ~20

Still a dangerous plan since this game is so important `\Westbrook has cost them so many offensive possessions`\Holy fuck KD got fouled.`\I think they had a come to Jesus after Crosby's concussion.   Can't let an incredible player get fucked up by some jagoff.   Makes the whole sport look ridiculous `\In theory, defense and 3 point shooting. In practice, occasional defense and mediocre shooting. `\Klay "Ugh, my hands still smell like pussy no matter how much I rinse them off" Thompson

^(doesn't he pull in mad talent or something?)`\I don't think we lose him but if we do it's been a hell of a ride.`\The Clippers`\What the fuck is that hairless monstrosity?!`\Green got stuffed!!`\The Don`\100%`\That was a nice lob`\I don't get to watch every Raptors game but with each game I watch, win or lose, I get more worried for them for the playoffs. The defense is elite on its day but the offense is really stagnant and they rely on Lowry and DeRozan to create something out of nothing most of the time. This would work better if you have Westbrook and Durant of course but even then it's not a guarantee.    `\So who are we looking to draft.  We look like a lottery team tonight`\Hope the refs have someone chewing their ears out for halftime, those were absolute shit calls for both sides`\We got ya the first time Russ, but not the second time. haha`\A disgrace to all Jeffs out there get your shit together bro.`\Anyone see what happened?`\Singler with the 90s hair`\They went to Durant a lot when he was put back in with like 4 minutes left. Still couldn't stop the bleeding. Hit 1 shot and 1 FT IIRC.`\Couldn't hold a dribble, got robbed by Paul, Johnson and Reddick. `\I guess Westbrook really do dis`\We really need this win then`\Shoutout to Norm, the only guy to play well tonight. Literally everybody else was subpar by their own standards.

Another night of fantastic officiating that I'm sure we'll see come playoff time, especially at home.  In a 20-point loss it doesn't make a difference in winning or losing, but getting to the line means setting a defense, getting opponents in foul trouble, and hopefully actually making the FTs.

Shoutout to Roberson and Waiters making all of the threes

Ready for T-Ross to come back, had enough of the JJ shooting threes thing, and this team needs spacing badly.

OKC amazing w/fastbreaks, O-rebounds, and easy baskets.  97 points through 3 quarters is insane.  Watching all of the jumpers/layups/O-boards, I do not understand how OKC loses.  Putting all my $ on a Bulls-Thunder finals should the Bulls qualify for the playoffs.`\Tim why the fuck would you foul? Now he's got 3 goddamn!`\Ugly 3rd quarter, Spurs still somehow +2`\Kanter going into beast mode `\The Warrior are a pretty good basketballs teams`\KD like next year my PG gonna make that.`\OKC didn't play well enough tonight to not deserve that joke.`\Totally logical reasoning`\The Raptors obviously didn't throw three people at Westbrook

`\OH, GIVE HIM THE BASKET!

That was so cool!`\Why?   They aren't going to catch the cavs and probably won't have anyone catch then`\recipe for rattle snake jam, haha I love it`\That passing was wacky`\I know Dray wasn't trying to complain about a moving screen`\Do you know in how many minutes?`\Curry had no chill at the end there.`\Sure, being 'athletic' is generally an attractive quality-but I would be surprised if there was a noticeably greater percentage of reasonably athletic individuals on r/nba than if you just picked someone off the streets of a city.  `\omg`\Think of how much Demar got 2-3 plus years ago.`\Singler just took a guaranteed putback away from Kanter LOL`\This shit is ugly`\Speights is the new Curry`\#\#FreeMorrow`\Two guesses: (1) in the first matchup both guys played their normal minutes and were largely ineffective. Payne in particular was bad. Defensively Payne cannot guard any of the dubs second unit (maybe Barbosa). Dubs were able to take advantage of his height with Livingston. Morrow in general is not the greatest defender And it seems like they've decided to generally go with singlet as he is stronger and longer and overall a better defender.

Or (2) they are holding them back as part of the element of surprise for the playoffs.

My guess is that (1) is more likely but you never know. `\Oh my god Giannis. I just screamed out loud on that one.`\Does Russell get that TO? IMO those should go to the person receiving the pass if it's a catchable pass.`\Get Morrow out, 1-5 and can't defend. Westbrook didn't pass the ball for a reason.`\I'm dying lmao `\Kd found so many people open on the 3, but no one can hit them. `\I don't know if I expected to see anything different tonight.`\Marginally better than Jason Thompson considering we cut him for Varajao.`\Adams holds Green, we get called for a foul`\pretty good but predictable

time for the writers to deviate from the formula`\Warriors 56-0 when leading by 7 once in the game.

Edit: off by one error.`\I think it's saying that the Celtics are doing better than their talent. They're getting by by hustling more than the other team, by going balls to the wall on a rebound when most teams in the regular season relax a little bit, etc. And that doesn't work in the playoffs when everyone hustles, or against a really good team that can just rain 3s over our heads and hustle won't matter. We've got great team play, great hustle and conditioning, so we get points and boards that we shouldn't, but we just don't have the talent to overcome the best teams when they play for real. `\We playing really pretty good `\this game just further proves my hypothesis of Dion Waiters being actual cancer.`\wtf is okc's defense`\Just let KD get his assist. Clearly we're not getting the win`\You're right, I don't know the circumstances.  I'm sure the mothers of all those fans fell gravely ill and they had to leave the game to rush to the hospital. `\Warriors went small and closed going away. The Thunder were on the back end. Once it turned, it got out of hand quick.`\Did Brian Davis just call holly Holm, Katie Holm...? Smdh`\McGary's defense looked pretty good, he was boxing out his man and stayed between him and the ball`\2-6`\Are you really still angry from two nights ago? Jesus dude.`\i like Iguoadala more than Draymond`\I agree, I'm in the UK so I can't catch the games usually but splash means I can watch the highlights easily`\Westbrook is going to realize he can't keep shooting threes...right? `\They don't really play any better with Griffin in the lineup. It's not like once he comes back they're going to be the best team in the league.`\The Thunder deserve to lose this and the next 3 games.`\FUCK..`\Thanks for the great work again. Do you have the play where Livingston passes it to Barbosa for a layup in transition? I think it's at 10:52 in the 4th.`\Not the brightest group`\Congratulations Marcus, you won the "Random Player that Goes Off Against the Thunder" lottery`\Man our play making looks really good. just gotta keep it up for 48 mins, and watch the turnovers.`\Cousins playing Rondo's big brother right there`\omg i just looked at stats, AND HOLY FUCK KANTER IS WRECKING THE SPURS ON THE BOARDS WAY MORE THAN I THOUGHT`\I was waiting for him to get T'd up`\CP3 is such a bitch.`\Thats reserved for the special Sunday games only.`\KD has choked up a fair few plays lately as well unfortunately. `\They looked good, too.`\Looks like the fucking bulls out there... hope they all get traded especially garpax.. this fucking guys need to get the fuck outta basketball`\Listen to JJs podcast with Deandre.

This is good training in case that needs to happen again.`\just the shooting `\Are you implying Warriors don't get calls or saying they don't get a lot of fouls because they generally stay on the perimeter?`\Oh come on Dray and Steph. How you gonna do them like that at the end?`\YOU JUST GOT DEFENSED BY ENES KANTER SON`\He needs to get better at it so I don't mind the open looks`\The Bulls don't want the Bulls to make the playoffs from the looks of it.`\The Speights giveth, the Speights taketh away.`\klay what is that`\no, he's not, KD is too`\hey man I'd still take it :(`\The ball hit his knee`\we been getting ours too man.

What's your issue?`\Westbrook gets knocked over no foul.
Harden moves into Ibakas arm and they call it`\Just today..`\Why the fuck was Randy Foye playing some minutes at PG over Cameron Payne???`\You put the Thunder in the East and they get a free trip to the Finals.

Young was a scoreboard technician when he started working for the Warriors years ago, and had additional duties added over the years. And in a league of homogeneity off the floor, Young's salt and pepper Afro stands out.
"I've always had a 'fro," he said. "We've had times where we cut it down. Chris Mullin gave me a buzzcut. It's been cut off at times. But it's been fun.""

Just Durant posting at the top of the key waiting for the ball, or Russ standing right outside the arc. Result is unclean entry passes, shitty spacing, and a hectic few seconds to attempt to get up a shot. And it is always a shot, never a pass. Partially because KD and Russ stop looking for the pass, and partially because the lack of movement means no one is in position to receive a pass.`\Westbrook completely lost his mind in the 4th.

You think he is gonna shrink away not wanna be on the court? Dude will now know that he is in your head, would still make the shot and get the foul`\Kanter is like FML after the and-one`\this.`\So much for this one lol`\Maybe so but fourth quarter execution has been a problem all year. I'm not overreacting over KDs blunders but the type of plays they're running in the 4th quarter. You don't see late shot clock isos for curry in GS or kawhi turnaround fadeaway contested jumpers in SA. The whole point of hiring Donavan was to get some creativity on offence and there just isn't anything different.

Maybe the Warriors won't bank on KD messing up but if I'm the Warriors I'm not losing sleep over a 7 game series against OKC.`\Choo choo!`\Someone tell me why in the world he didn't play ot against the Warriors after kd fouled out?

We don't even need a complicated playbook, we just need someone who can help these guys move the ball around more. I'm tired of only seeing one or two passes a possession. Half of those passes are KD/Russ => Adams (Screen) => KD/Russ => Contested shot. That's not the ball movement we need. `\Like [this?](http://imgur.com/xAuAxzW)`\Oh nice a bit of Stevie ray Vaughan from ABC. `\Like I have said I was new to the sport, and with the rumors KD could potentially leave I was curious about the dynamic in OKC without one or the other and who their fans would prefer stay if it came to that.

I said that I, personally, like it when one of them is on the bench. Have you seen their 4th quarters? It always ends up with Westbrook completely deferring to Durant and if Durant is stopped then Durant completely defers to Westbrook

They keep handing the ball to each other

Now watch the rest of the game. You see Durant making plays with the bench and you see Westbrook making plays with the bench

And Westbrook hardly ever runs plays for Durant and vice versa

doesn't it make more sense for Robes to be on Kawhi?


`\Nah I think you win on Sat`\The reason the Thunder collapse in the fourth is because they don't believe in their offensive system. It works for them all game but as soon as they need a clutch bucket they revert to Durant/Westbrook ISO and it's too easy to defend when you can be assured that 1 or 2 players is willing to take a bad contested shot.

Look at how many assists Russ gets in the 4th quarter compared to the first 3.`\Kanter is Turkish, not a white European. `\LOL, here come the OKC fans pretending like the refs haven't been riding Thunder dicks all night.`\What do we call this game ?

I'm like that with football but officiating is way worse in the NFL.`\Nevermind him. `\Hopefully okay.`\He killed us on opening night too. In the second half of that game you guys went to Kanter and Adams together and it slaughtered any lineup without Duncan on the boards. It was what won the game.

Edit: Yup`\It seems as if Westbrook decides to stop passing the ball in the 4th and KD forgets what teams he's on. Bad shots and TOs galore every 4th quarter.

And they did, what's your problem here?

Not only do they have too many poor individual defenders, but their team defense is just atrocious.

When they were up by 9 or whatever it was, GS evened it up and eventually took the lead because it looked like OKC said to themselves "We're up by 10, they can't stop us. If we just keep scoring, we'll win."

Well, instead they just gave up a ton of easy buckets to the Dubs. Fast breaks, open looks, backdoor cuts, it literally looked like OKC just stopped caring about defense.

The old cliche of "offense wins games, defense wins championships" is repeated year after year for a reason. Defense is way harder to play well, but once you know what you're doing, lapses and fuck ups are less common.

Even the best players have off shooting nights. Stef Curry has bad nights. Your offense can let you down.

Everyone is capable on some level, some guys are excellent at certain things (Sully at rebounding, Kelly at hitting 3s as a big, Smart at being a defensive menace, etc) but each is also flawed on some level.

Payne had a few bad games and I was originally for benching him, but now I'm wanting him back on the floor badly.`\ITT: Stickum jokes.`\JJ on the sideline practicing my signature move `\hahaha, every touch foul called on Thunder, while wArriors can rape at will`\I don't really notice him usually so I guess that means he's fine `\young & zeller should not get time if we are working toward getting a good seed.  at least rozier hasnt looked like a negative on the floor the previous two games.  young and zeller are useless right now.  lets be real, if that means im mean well we just let up 66 points in a half.  i guess i should be happy`\I like him `\Flair up`\I had to walk away.`\He held Kawhi's shoulder down ala Griffen. `\ahhhh the 4th such a nice time for an OKC fan`\Is that you Oscar?`\Speights is a fatty! I mean't that as a compliment of course!`\ugh Durant keeps getting undeserved free throws`\That should have been a tech`\Fucking Westbrook man`\No idea. There's literally no explanation. He's not even bad on D, he can be hidden pretty easily. Singler should not be getting minutes over him (or anybody)`\He already did.`\what happened to Green?`\urine idiot`\Abysmal shooting by both teams. Could be the worst overall shooting game of the season.`\wow shit call`\Ricky "30% from 3" Rubio with the dagger lol`\Dwight misses that stickum`\But giving them minutes to try to improve would be a nice start, we've nearly clinched a spot.
Payne is our main backup point guard, by not giving him minutes he's going to get exhausted come playoffs.

And Donovan just keeps trying really weird lineups that would never work and he never adapts to situations

`\if kanter doesn't play during crunch time im going to be very upset`\Curry hasn't been challenged at the rim this whole half.  What's going on?`\Lebron hasn't been top three. Not consistently.`\Well, when you talk like that, yeah...`\What has happened to Ibaka? he just got scored on by way smaller dudes twice in thirty seconds of game time. he barely even jumped.`\I think that's the nicest thing Shaq has ever said about Dwight....`\Ok, we coming back. Don't know how this happened, but it did. `\Serge Ibaka played like he was 33 tonight.`\Diaw you crafty motherfucker`\No fuck ups from Singler today!`\Alright this game is starting to make me nervous for both teams. I want to see OKC get the win but GS is also playing to tie the longest home winning streak and stay in the running for 41-0.`\Durant is out...hold on OKC`\Lets us play 5v5 on offense `\Draymond and Durant are always talking`\Varjao punched himself`\A concrete block is more talented than rivers`\Wasn't speights shit at one point this season? Because this game and the last, he has been great against us `\Dion and Foye, you never know how they'll do in a game`\No Durant? Westbrook early 2015 Beast Mode confirmed, trip double before half time`\Curry, could you like, not? `\the refs really got the OKC foul situation memo today huh?`\Well I mean technically we haven't lost a game when he gets it so it's not all that selfish`\People would be more happy if you just murdered her.

But ya know...before you do....I uh...wouldn't mind porkin' her. `\O-K-C`\Danny Green is getting blown by Durant like he's not even there. `\That was a sloppy game but at least we got the win.

But what I really what to know is if anyone else noticed towards the end of the game that you could see some kid in the background wearing a Sonics jersey. Thought that was pretty gunny.`\my god russ`\Might not make the playoffs `\Oh my lol

this game`\I can afford to eat at better places but I didn't know people had this bad of an opinion about it.  I only eat Tuna there though.  Hard to fuck up Tuna.`\9 ast rn`\I love the way they play basketball honestly man. As a Lakers fan I definitely am bitter about their success, but as a basketball fan i fucking love the way they play and Steph is such a good basketball player. `\He was an awful mascot, but he was OUR awful mascot.`\I'd rather Singler score 20 and do nothing else than Durant put up 30/7/7 and play good defense. `\Why this was downvoted to -1 I have no idea.`\Waiters excellent awareness and reaction. `\This is so fun.`\....what is that`\hate the defense on curry. He's getting open layups`\Lol`\Why isn't Nowitzki on the list of possible best shooters ever? Dude was cash for years.`\DAMMIT, DION!`\Sam and Ali!`\I never want to see them again. I hope we get rid of them this offseason. Somehow.`\Westbrook is the best.`\you can have crawford!`\see curry you gotta be selfish sometimes `\35 REVERSE`\Curry took way too long to take that shot. Thunder wasn't even gonna waste the effort until they saw him hesitate.`\Except they aren't ahead of us in Margin. Nt though.`\You could tell they were done by their body language.`\Always happy to spread good news `\DeMar and Lowry playing like swamp ass`\I haven't seen him play much but he looked awful. He had a couple open 3's that weren't even close, plus two really bad turnovers.`\[Delay of game son Rondo](https://streamable.com/97em)`\Super glad KD just made that, but I hope he doesn't start jacking up 3s again. We really need this game`\played against a visiting australian basketball team in HS, all they talked about was how much of a joke Subway is.

you eat wat you can afford tho.`\also i'm not sure

>The fighting in hockey isn't really dangerous though.

is true

with all the shit coming out about head injuries, i bet someone somewhere has had concussion problems from a right hook`\https://streamable.com/tnab`\Shoutout dude behind scola picking his nose`\The spacing that Ross provides is so important to this team`\he never really smiles anymore, does he? Just noticed that`\Anderson is just completely inept offensively`\Dion Waiters was so great this game, happy for him after his brother's death*
17pts, 7-11 FG, 3-6 3PT`\Russ looking like the best guard in the game right now.`\I hate speights so much.`\Was that Ray Allen sitting by Jay-Z?`\Paul George + turnovers are killing us `\I think he nearly got a Quadruple Double because of his turnovers`\daaaaaayum`\Ah the kisscam, time for the cringe`\OKC seems to always start well in every game and then end poorly.`\only  if u admiit its not only warriors tht set moving screen`\pistons gonna help him get a ride home`\These calls are killing my blood pressure `\And it's over. As long as Kerr just don't sub in the 3rd stringers, we're good.`\You want raptor friends?!

This is how you get raptor friends!`\These refs suck.`\Dion gonna go 4/4 on long stepback 2's now. `\Welcome to r/thunder `\Spurs were struggling until Westbrook brought the Spurs back with his bad play. Thx `\that's a tech ref!!!! fucking shit`\MO BUCKETS :D`\Mo buckets is amazing.`\Golden Speights Warriors`\I can't tell whether their bench is bad so Russ and KD have to dominate the ball, or if their bench is bad *because* Russ and KD dominate the ball.

Either way, a team that plays Singler, Waiters, and Roberson significant minutes isn't going to hang with the Warriors. There was a stretch of the late 3rd/early 4th where the Dubs had no starters on and managed to stretch their lead against a unit of KD and bench players. That's bad news.`\How was that not a foul? You have to give the shooter enough room to land. `\MICKEY should block at least 16 shots in 8 minutes`\I'm watching ou. Why aren't we beating Utah worse? `\You're shitting me`\Metaphor for me in my earlier relationships. `\What the fuck KD?`\because of 1 regular season loss?`\Durant hunting for that 10th assist`\http://imgur.com/unnJUob`\Bench pls...`\If I was casey at this point I would put him in at the beginning of the 4th, just to give him experience.`\great game by the thunder tonight. Wish you guys good luck for the playoffs `\Triple double tho`\hes a bic boi`\That'd be a pretty funny joke if he had coached at least one complete season.`\Barbosa does not need to be that aggressive there`\What is all this sloppy shit?`\OKC better make their run while Speights is out /s`\Westbrook about to go full Draymond Green`\Where do you see these lists? I'd enjoy following them.`\Not saying you're wrong at all but I'm sure they might be covered from something like that ever since the Jackie Moon and bear incident in the 70s. Besides, have you not noticed how old gramps is up there? You don't do whatever he does and make it to gray haired years by fucking up. He's the last of a dying art and pretty soon we're only gonna have the Chinese and the Russians perform these death defying stunts to satiate our tease with death. If little Jimmy does happen to see him go splat then little Jimmy should appreciate being apart of history. If anything Gramps was getting pissy with his assistant for breaking his rhythm and taking too long with the handoff.`\IT was such a steal for the Celtics, perfect player to build a team around`\Russ is everywhere lmao`\Back to Back vs 2 days of rest with a shitty bench`\Singler is utter trash`\lol these refs are fucking pathetic.`\BREWER DID A THING`\Yes. Good thing he didn't though, *am-I-right guys*???`\Damn that block`\OH NOOOOO MOOOO WHY YOU TRY TO DUNK???`\"35 reverse 35 reverse"....the Fuck? Did we just call a play?`\PENALTY FLAG DOC`\It's too close for this bullshit!`\I wonder how anxiety inducing it is to play against golden state knowing they can always make a comeback. always. yikes.`\Quarter was stellar that. Otherwise was 3rd he but. `\If I had written that comment, I would be snickering to myself for like half an hour after writing it.  Well done.`\9 turnovers isn't so great.  Although he seemed to be the only OKC player that could get anything going offensively.  When he on the bench the offense just seem to stagnate and rely exclusively on Westbrook iso-ball
`\Trust me, I get it.`\TY3S`\Gorgui "Not Magic Johnson" Dieng`\Pretty Tricky Ricky. More like Pretty Fluky Ruby. I tried`\he makes it more of a challenge `\I get annoyed whenever Cage talks to be honest...`\Adams pushed him to slow him down`\Russell Chokebrook`\Who's still drinking beer?`\This game seems like its over. Westbrook cost them by playing like garbage when Durant went on the bench with a big lead`\Middleton has been invisible this game, we need to get him going.`\JON3S`\LMA is the best player in NBA history`\Ok... I don't know where you got the idea that I want KD or WB to leave-- they are among my favorite players to watch. They are also grown men who should do what they want to do. `\Oh, theyll call that kick ball, but not Curry's.`\Adams`\if he's jacking threes you know it's gonna be a bad game. `\How good would Westbrook be if he was a 37% 3 point shooter?`\Of course he can't, he's in foul trouble :P`\Boogie is a lot worse if this is how he acts every game. `\ANTHONY MORROWWWWWW`\Damn Durant just got twisted by Curry`\Varjao forgot he was playing`\listen...i mean cut this thing to 10 by the half and feel better about urself. `\They gotta keep the home streak alive`\Chokelahoma City Blunder`\LET'S GOOOOO`\Well that was stupid Roberson.`\I may be an idiot but I don't think I'd give up Stevens for Durant...

`\oooh oooh oooh, I'm good. So good.`\"sloppy"

I like this game`\Westbrook playing smart basketball`\Am I alone in preferring Payne over Foye?`\Alright man.`\You know Green is like a guy you'd hate unless he was on your team and I understand because we have Adams. But fuck him sooooo much. `\What a team.`\The back to back games from OKC look to be a factor; they seemed sluggish toward the end of this game`\What do you mean "when was the last time we beat a good team?" We hardly played any good teams before the all-star break. Our SOS was one of the weakest in the league. What loses are you upset about? The two, highly competitive games against one of, if not the best team the NBA has ever seen? A team which has absolutely demolished every other "good team" it has faced, excluding us.

When did you start watching this team, man? We have destroyed most competition we have faced in regular season or post season for the past five years.

2011, 55-27, our second playoff appearance, we lost to the Mavericks who would go on to beat the Heat's big three.

2012, 47-19, we make it to the finals after beating the reigning champs, Lakers, and Spurs; then lose to a lineup with more talent than even us IN THE NBA FINALS.

2014, 60-22, we beat the rockets but lose Westbrook midway, still take a game off Memphis

2015, 59-23, we make it to the conference finals but lose our first two games due to missing Ibaka due to YET AGAIN, an injury. Immediately win the first two games of his return, but can't overcome the 0-2 start against one of the better teams of recent years.

2016, injuries.


We have been losing games a lot recently, yes, but how about we chill on the soothsaying until we see if we can get back into our groove. We were 40-14 before the ASG. We started this year off looking like shit too, how about we chill the fuck out before we decide we're trash.`\Jame Young onto KD is a switch we probably wanna avoid.`\GOTTA GET DEFENSE BRO, CLEARLY OUR OFFENSE DOESN'T SUFFER WITHOUT SCORERS`\Fwiw I liked you for a minute yesterday`\[KD blows by Johnson dunks it and-1](https://streamable.com/zw7i)`\Russ at 10/8/7

I'm just thinking if we lose tomorrow it's gotta be like 1-5 or something ridiculously bad. `\O J Mayo is fucking up`\they need some stickum`\Thanks coach, team is losing focus.`\23 point lead to 12 point lead to 21 point lead`\The Sixers tried the same thing and it worked`\Dude...relax.  We're beating the #2 seed in the West on their home court`\Harsher penalties for fouling. Eliminate *all* intentional fouls.

It's really dumb though.`\I'll start making an effort to comment more in Magic game threads. I mean, what's not to like? My childhood memories of Shaq and Hardaway in Orlando blue still make me happy as fuck - Magic official Eastern Conference team then. It is decided. `\Wow, okay. Thanks for the insight - I wasn't aware of that. Hopefully tonight's game is injury-free, no shitty ref calls, and all that stuff. Cheers. `\So is any team going to get physical with Curry? `\Livingston is a guard that plays like a big

Speights is a big that plays like a guard`\You guys creepin' on that third seed`\westbrook honestly blew hot shit most of that game. i get it, that's how he plays, but that shit doesn't fly in playoffs. this was a mediocre ass game by both teams tbh.`\Embarrassing bottle job by Thunder, I always think that if the team starts off well that they will lose because they always throw away leads, I'm just surprised it took until the 4th quarter before they lost it.

I think that was the point the game changed.`\Ikr he shoots everything else `\SINGLER AT CENTER LET'S GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO`\Fade the fucking Kings flairs already`\I mean, I get your point, but it's not like it's a rare occurrence`\Dagger`\http://gfycat.com/ImmenseIncompleteBlackfish`\Saw that oop coming `\A lot of it had to do with the offense bogging down - what with Dion and Foye playing together shouldn't be too surprising.

You need some fucking floor spacing / offense!`\take er ez
`\detrooooiiitttt!!!!`\Let's go boys!`\We're 1-2 against you guys and 2-1 against the Cavs. I know that doesn't mean much, but we have much up issues with guards, since you have two elite guards and we can't hide Reggie. I know other Pistons fans have expressed a similar concern. Basically I think we're more likely to go to 6 games with them than you guys. Who knows though, you and the Cavs are great teams so it's a toss up kinda.

Edit: Also want to add that when the Raptors play in Detroit, they get tons of fans there, more so than Cleveland, so we don't have as great of home court advantage.`\You're gonna die`\RUSS I LOVE YOU BUT PLEASE FUCKING STOP`\lol it's not meant to be, OKC.`\I love RW but God damn that's stupid as fuck. `\What? `\curry stop theyre done`\Glass eater`\damn you, you son of a bitch.

Maybe while you are looking up the definition of choking you can check raging too.

You probably think losing any game when you were up at one point is choking right? Nearly every close game has each team go up by 5-10 points at one stage.

So yeh getting outscored by 16 points over 2 quarters by a team thats undefeated at home is not a choke. Dont be too salty that you get called out for being wrong tho, kid.

LET ME BREAK YOUR SENTENCE DOWN AS WELL.

IT WAS THE SAME GOLDEN STATE TEAM FROM 2 YEARS AGO.

What you are trying to say is.

If it was the current Golden State team and not the one from 2 years ago. `\westbrook does a really good job on curry`\We shall see.`\Widening the court would create a lot more spacing. Help jump shooting teams?`\Which is pretty fucking filthy `\Wow that was all hand`\Ah, guess I missed one`\Same`\Chill dude it's 1 game which is super unlikely to have seeding implications for us`\source?`\durants passing has been excellent. creating so many good looks`\wtf is this D`\I didn't mean it as an insult at all, for what it's worth. I'd be confident in any first round series, but I think you guys would be the most fun to play.  And there is a bit of tension there.`\How is that possible when he didn't even play 24 minutes?`\At least OKC didn't blow a late 4th quarter lead.`\Brody & KD balling out, but C's look like they can claw their way back in whenever one of them is off the floor`\I'm surprised he is an nba player `\A rookie we drafted in the second round but never bothered to use, bout fucking time he got a chance.`\Green hustled, got a jump ball, and juuuust barely got the tip for the possession.`\what the fuck is kevin durant doing? ever since the acy  thing he's been taking it as a personal challenge just chucking shit`\Imagine sneaking those dogs on an intramural frisbee team and an opposing team not knowing what's coming.  `\KYLE SINGLER: 11 PTS, 2 REB, 1 AST, 3-5 3PT, +26

MVP CONFIRMED`\billy donovon staggering line ups, nba fucked`\I don't think so.  As long as they bring this level of intensity to a series with any of those teams, they can compete.  They've shown the ability to play at the Warriors level for 3/4ths of a game, but they need to be mentally tougher down the stretch.`\Can Kentucky beat the Bucks?`\We got some pretty enticing 2nd rounders if you're interested`\The clear contrast between the bench production and starter production is so big Smitch has to be doing this on purpose.`\I'd rather have Russ missing the two clutch three pointers as well, these makes might give him an idea for the playoffs.`\That was so dumb rockets`\MVP!!!`\holy shit kerr is livid, I have barely seen ball games this season cause of school but has Kerr ever been like this?`\Lots of lazy transition D from GS tonight. `\Thats actually my birthday `\Lets go bucks. Light a fire under your asses and get it done`\Durant closer to a triple-double than Westbrook at halftime

Which probably means that Westbrook will come out and have one by the end of the 3rd`\did we just lose to the fucking timberwolves?`\nail those 3s mate`\Nice foul though `\Agreed. Granted, I don't watch a ton of Thunder games, but my guess as to what their issue is, as it always has been, how limited they are outside of KD and Westbrook.


I notice that the rest of the cast is fine for the majority of the game, they're even good at times. But when it gets tight, they all defer to Westbrook and KD, which, on paper, is exactly what they should do. But every Defense knows this and plans for it. Ibaka's 3's never seem to find the net in crunch time. I would not trust Waiters with the ball in the clutch. Adams is only good for a put back. Morrow can't play defense. I don't really think there's  much else. Defenses just gang defend Westbrook and Durant and that has to be tough for them. Knowing that "alright it's all up to me or my team mate to win this," night after night has got to take its toll on your mental fortitude, especially when you have to play a team as perfect as the Warriors. They need a guy like Harrison Barnes or someone who can give them another option on the perimeter. That's my assessment. `\"renovations" `\And you call yourself a Celtics fan. For shame.`\THANK YOU WESTBROOK`\Goddamn Westbrook.`\Was I just not paying much attention or were there not as many good plays as usual?

`\>can shoot

Well everyone "CAN SHOOT" just not everybody is very good at getting it in the basket consistently. Roberson is a mediocre shooter at best. He's a good defender.`\Man, Shaun's turnaround jumper is cleaner than the TNT edit of Die Hard.`\yeah i think he almost single-handedly gave up their 4th quarter leads for a month or two, but he looks pretty solid now`\It says something when 13-11-11 is probably Westbrook's worst triple-double`\No, I'm loving this winning streak. Keep the momentum going.`\God I hope he does prove you wrong, that'd be fucking retarded considering how often this shit happens to Singler`\slow game`\Dude those are the first calls that haven't gone your way tonight, calm down.`\KAT KAT KAT KAT KAT>KD KAT KAT KAT KAT KAT`\If only Dwight had used Stickum, he could have held on to tht lob at the end`\cuz they have no offensive plan`\Get the fuck outta here with these calls`\Yo...What? Like I watched the game but.....WHAT???

Durant/DeAndre FT flip flop at the end there was too much. What is going on right now.`\At this point does anyone seriously think they won't beat 72 -10? `\The league has also gotten smarter about not allowing that, too. Part of why Hibbert has fallen off so much.`\[Foye vey](https://streamable.com/e6ji)`\Live by Russell die by Russell `\i love how vintage ibaka is a thing now lol`\It is. The dude has so much heart and is so easy to poke fun at it sucks. It's like whatever that "it factor" is he's missing it on the court.`\lmao what just happened
`\Speights Yam > Slim Reaper`\I don't even know what happened there. `\Kyle Singler is the ~~darkest~~whitest timeline.`\He's just been slipping on some stray syrup spots.`\Man this game and the Trailblazer one have been my favorite of the season, nice to see us playing so well and the team is smiling`\DION`\No, haven't had a bad game like is in a long time.`\durant didn't really shoot much either in the 4th. both looked worn out mentally and physically by the end there `\Clean block`\He's 26% this season, it's still important for him to take the shot though so that he spreads the defense.`\No half court shot :(`\Not as much and not as blatant.`\I'm with ya brother `\Honestly, Warriors are so lucky to have a terrific coach and leader like Kerr.  Players need someone like that to keep your head in the game.  I don't know if Donovan can be that kinda coach, but hoping for you guys that he can figure it out.`\Cam and Dion playing together, perfect.`\Should be a working one in [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/nbastreams/comments/4b0gjy/game_thread_philadelphia_76ers_vs_oklahoma_city/) thread`\Aldridge has come to play`\yeh ugly for both teams :(`\Picture the Rockets being favorites to make the Finals and some Matt Barnes/Patrick Beverley type player from some 1st round fodder team takes out Harden making him miss the playoffs and then most of next year. Russell Westbrook is a fucking king in OKC, the entire city was sad the next day. `\Ho boy looks like we're gonna get some Withey action tonight.`\Or a knee.`\OKC has shot 16 free throws so far vs SA's 4. Okay.`\If anything, they should at least accent it to a team color or the court colors..  The stupid red sharpie line is annoying.`\It looks like Pierce is playing in black socks and sandals`\I don't want to wake from this dream. `\But...but...where's the ain't game till serge does his thing one?`\Yeah. We had to sit through Perry Jones III starting at point guard. `\That doesn't even surprise me haha `\so the stat that OKC plays better when only one of KD/RWB scores 25+ continues`\Payne is a rookie and a defensive liability, that's why. `\I don't think I've ever heard JVG do a Blazer game`\We've complained less in general this year. `\Sweet talk to the bay kerr`\Yeah, he is 3-11 from 3 tonight, and 8-12 from everywhere else.

He needs to take 3s, but not like he has been. Especially when he is shooting so well from inside the line `\Welp, Dubs dropped 132 last time in Cleveland and 120 against SA. So maybe they're saving that Good D for the playoffs.`\ALSO: **RODMAN**`\Preach it.`\It's almost like we're contenders`\Or the drive

Or the kick

Or rebound`\Bruno put in work tonight.`\Sup Thunder bros?

Also, for those not used to watching the Thunder broadcast, the Thunder fans would like to apologize for the commentary of Michael Cage. We are very, very sorry. `\Last 12 gon' be good!`\Is Curry playing?`\lmao Boogie pulling Rondo. It's like they trade places.`\I was kidding.

They were on a collision course for a Heat team that had ass-raped them a year earlier.`\Thanks mark`\Does Ibaka never touch the paint anymore?`\what`\Westbrook is so bad in short clock situations lmao`\**^^DAMMMMMMMNNNN DANNNIEEELLL**`\Jabari has officially found his jumper`\I like him. He's more willing to experiment than Brooks was. Guys seem to have bought in.`\Rodman too. `\A S S I S T S`\God Westbrook is fucking garbage tonight.`\Curry looks tirrrrred`\Yeah, I'd say my execution on that one was about at the same level as the Thunder this past week.`\GIANNIS VS KD AT POINT.
LETS GO, I GOT DRINKS RDY!`\Alright Thunder, I'm going to be focused on the Sooners game.  Don't screw up, 'kay?

Thanks.`\WHY IS BREWER IN THE GAME`\They aren't the only reason but they are the only reason Russ and KD are in double digits`\OKC is scary when they play like this. `\If he doesn't Westbrook will`\Nice not having to stay up until 4am to watch a game for once, hey?`\Well Happy Birthday `\id rather gsw not break season wins record and get 4th seed. `\Damn this is ugly`\My god Kanter, fucking stop with the rebounds. We're used to dominating the glass, the fuck is this shit`\2000 games into the season, "the refs were bad on both sides of the court tonight tbh" starts to sound old when someone writes it in every game thread.

The officiating really was fine tonight.`\Damn, I didn't think we had that many team fouls already. Thanks. `\Collinson? GJ FSOK.`\I don't think its Donovan's fault, I feel like he has got us playing smarter basketball on offense during 90% of the game, it's just when it enters the clutch KD and Westbrook try to do too much.

The defense hasn't been great though, not a fan of how much we switch on pick and rolls.

I think we can match it with you guys, spurs and cavs if we just had a reliable wing who could shoot and play a bit of defense. Roberson destroys the spacing and Waiters and Singler are shite.`\not surprising because they're okc fans? get over yourself lol`\That was the most Westbrook thing that could have happened.`\time out casey u twat`\What the fuck Evelyn, she was just saying random numbers at the end, there were only 4 left, how do you mess that up so badly?`\OKC fans relax.  These are the streaky wolves.  The other shoe will drop.
`\Soft`\Battle Toads`\Yaeh`\Wtf has happened to Ibaka this season. `\finally a finish that wasn't heart stopping. can't handle too many more of those`\He wasnt as explosive to the rim today, most of his shots were pull up jumpers or bad 3s`\Looks like Harris is eyeing 30. `\OH FUCK.  WITHEY WITH THE SLAM.  `\I don't see DeMarre coming back being a huge difference other than not having a gaping hole defensively at the 4. The shots go to Lowry and Derozan. Carroll returning doesn't make them jump the Cavs or Thunder in my mind. I have them below GS, SA, CLE, OKC, and when Blake comes back I have the Clippers at least tied with Toronto`\The Clippers are definitely not 0-1 against the Thunder`\Or Ibaka can learn to catch a fucking ball. `\What is it with Thunder and 4th quarters`\Max as a top 5 player in the comp? Yeh there wasnt much further he could go.`\Nobody invokes cognitive dissonance like Chris Paul. I respect him so much for his basketball skill and IQ. But he can play like such a little bitch sometimes. `\Donovan looks like an older John Cena`\How was that a foul?`\WTH just happened... Clippers probably led for less than 5 mins all game wow`\I thought it was 228?`\Almost halfway to a Quad-Dub 29pt/10rb/10ast/4L`\We're getting destroyed on the glass `\wtf huestis wea u been al my lyf`\KD to Boston getting some League Pass Halftime love. YOU CAN'T STOP THE NARRATIVE`\Kanter with the offensive rebounds!`\I can't help but laugh at it even having just been torn apart`\He's been like Tim Duncan tonight. `\That was the Morrow highlight we have been looking for the whole game. `\FINALLY, I heard TDE was about to start rolling out a bunch of music from it's artists. might as well start it off with Kdot.`\These refs are ass.`\True, and I think also one of them have to step up to be a leader. We have no leader right now on this team. Believe it or not, leader of the team was Kendrick Perkins. Ever since he left our team was never really the same especially on the defensive end. I think with Brooks and now Donovan has not been able to get into them about ignoring teammates late in games and playing ISO 1 on 5 basketball. That is something that has to change either a veteran or someone on the coaching staff has to get into them a bit. I think Westbrook also gets lazy on defense and our team sometimes gets stagnant on offense watching KD and Westbrook shoot late in games instead of moving around, creating, hustling, the things that help you win games.`\Get some Russ! `\I've always done at least one opponent highlight per game on my own, any more usually by request. Check my comments in Thudenr post-game threads`\I am woman but drink and like sex loL laugh pls`\Holy SHIT, that was the last thing I expected.`\Still believeable. `\Lmao even Singler gobbling up rebounds in the middle of the Clippers.`\Its so hilarious listening to Dion Waiters constantly yell "And 1" after terrible shots.`\Does this automatically turn to the post game thread? or do I have to find a new home?`\Steph is the greatest shooter ever, klay is in the top 10 and dray is about to break the record for triple doubles post nba aba merger. This team also has a better net differential

EDIT: Damn I really hope people dont shit on the Dubs and say the bulls were still better even if they break the record and win the title. Or say its not as hard to do it today bc the league is soft or shit like that`\Im no NBA genius but I think the Thunder should run more plays where Adams gets to shoot near the basket because he's good at that now.`\No they didn't`\He is. Because the basketball hall of fame isn't associated exclusively with the NBA, both college and international accomplishments are enough to get you in.`\roflmao`\Ah I overlooked that. Proof provided.`\Need Bogut and Draymond in there, getting owned on boards`\fuck everything`\I wish she'd leak some nudes `\Hahaha,yeah,can't see it happening now. `\lol he really did.`\Who was that yelling at Barnes from the OKC bench?`\Why should they be paid more though? They aren't an integral part of the business of basketball`\Curry is a bad bad man `\the problem is that you're watching the team he's joining 0=)`\nah. theres at least one great story every year`\[Now I am last](http://espn.go.com/video/clip?id=14890738)

`\It's so obvious, everytime he comes in we gain a lead.`\wow`\what the hell happened to Ibaka. This guy fell off the face of the earth. Is it Donovan, or is he really nothing but a jump shooter now? And not a good one either. his defense also has gone downhill. `\I think so, if the refs are going to call some of the fouls they've called for the Thunder.

`\rage is real`\His next meeting with Obama at the White House will be to ask for the keys.`\"These guys fuck"`\Morrow's release is beautiful.`\I have a feeling he might make one of the all-rookie teams.`\I dunno I thought it was just great defense.  Thunder drew fouls and Spurs hit long 2s so te score is low.  Our offense didn't stagnate so overall I'm happy.  Plus Kanter got to beast with the starters so that makes me even happuer.`\Long as they've changed their flair. Most supersonics flair fans are assholes towards OKC. `\WTF KD THAT WAS A LUCKY FUCKING GOD DAMMIT `\The second one the ref put the ball in his stomach and Rondo let it bounce and looked away again before grabbing it and the ref from the other side called it. Basically a 'fuck you, take the ball and play the game' call. Pretty stupid of Rondo after the first call to try and pull it again.`\35 REVERSE ?`\No curry. Please no. You cant do this. Not again!`\I'd buy a Waiters vs Austin Rivers one-on-one PPV`\KD's been the only one who's been able to create good shots consistently for the team. Westbrook's been pretty bad this game, all things considered.`\Recency bias. That team was real good.`\i like these detroit commentators. somehow theyve turned westbrooks negatives in to a positive`\.....`\This is wild. And I like it. `\Ugh`\David West I'm so fucking happy you came here`\big dick dray`\ok so i stopped watching at the end of the 1st half cos i was busy and thought OKC would easily win.

If you actually think he's better on D than Ibaka you need to sit down and maybe go watch a new sport.

I will say, I agree with you though, but I also agree with Shaq. The bottom line is this: OKC is talent deprived, and I know you're thinking how is that possible with WB and Durant on the same team. But look at them. No one is a threat outside of KD/WB. It's a two man show every single night. OKC will never be a real championship contender this way, and you can take that to the bank.

This is a failure on management, and to an extent KD/WB because they don't fully trust the other guys to get it done.

`\Yet they still encourage completely pointless fighting. I know people like to claim it's so the other team knows not to fuck with you or to not check you too hard or whatever, but a) have you ever seen an "enforcer" in any other sport, ever, to counter overly physical play? b) shouldn't it be the refs job to make sure you aren't hitting people too hard? c) the "fights" don't do shit anyway and no one ever gets hurt, so who gives a fuck about the other team's enforcer anyway? The whole thing is so retarded. You've got this beautiful game going on and then suddenly it's WWE for 5 minutes.

in one game, yes, but 4 times in 7 games, i think theres no chance. Like I said, OKC played about as well as possible on saturday and still lost. The dubs were down and cut down the lead with the lineup of death. You wanna talk bout benches getting shorter, i think GSW may benefit from that more as they can play the best lineup of all time together. OKC's issue is that they cant get a 4th and 5th guy to support their top 3, not so much the bench.

Kerr can also run circles around Donovan coaching wise. The thunder wont have a special plan to beat them, itll be just go at them with our best guys, and its really just not enough. You cant beat them that way, theyre too good.

The Spurs on the other hand can devise a gameplan to try to exploit mismatches. I think theyll take a page out of clevelands book. They can slow it down, defend amazing, and while they dont have lebron, they have 2 guys that can create offense while slowing down, through Aldridge and Kawhi post ups.

I dont think the spurs will beat them, and theres a shot they are an awful matchup, but they have Pop and with that the ability to devise a good gameplan, so I think they have a shot of pulling something off. The Thunder have what we saw the last 3 games, and they came away with 3 Ls. Not a big surprise the Warriors played better down the stretch in all the games, because A. Theyre better coached, and B. (in the 1st 2 games) they can go to their lineup of death which the thunder have no answer for `\I been calling him Jeff Whitey for years now... didnt know it was Withey `\In the playoffs against great defenses, simple offenses don't work, theyre not going to let you execute in crunch time.

To me, steph brings my dreams to life. Like just seeing him play and have these fantastic plays game after game. These shots that can't seem to do anything else but go in, no matter how far, no matter how contested. Somehow even still, he's better than what I could even imagine as being the best.

I dont know if he is currently properly, over, or under rated.

But he has not ALWAYS been overrated.

I will also throw out he's a backup to a superstar/MVP. CP3s backup is here comes Austin rivers. Blakes backup was hawes. I don't even know who fucking lebrons backup is. Good players play over 40 minutes a playoff game so what's the point in getting a good player to play behind him `\OKC is just like "fuck it were gonna post up KD every possession until they stop it"`\Brah lmao`\This game would have been a different story all together if we just ran more 35 reverse
`\> It's not like basketball where one player can carry a team.

Price is still a player, should have made your statement more clearer. Rechhi had 2 pts in 5 games. What if Kariya was in the Czech Republic game and scored in the shootout? That'd pretty much improve their chances *tenfold*... It's all speculation. Kariya is a better addition than Recchi, so his subtraction creates a bigger loss. You take shit too literally, but it's obvious he would impact the team in a positive manner.

No problem, same time next week?


Edit to your edit: wasn't talking about Olympics buddy.`\Tell him I said thanks`\I can't believe that after the quarter we just had, that I'm still not comfortable. We've had so many collapses lately that I think I'm broken

Not the flashiest player but he contributes. He was very bad in the first couple of months but he's found his groove. Don't buy into the anti Kyle circlejerk.`\This is where you hate Westbrook. `\Thunder forgot how to shoot and play D.  Also Deandre Jordan magically started making all his free throws.`\And the dagger`\I don't know why anyone believed them. Ever since the MAPS program started the OKC urban renaissance back in the late 80s/early 90s, OKC's been trying to get a pro franchise as part of bringing the city from a hopeless backwater cow town to an actual city.

They tried MLB first, I think, then NHL, when both were looking at where they might want expansion teams.

First time they actually managed to get a foot in the door was with the New Orleans Hornets. Oklahoma City went basketball mad that season.

Then the Sonics team got bought by OKC owners, and well, the rest is history.`\Yeah that's true `\Somebody gif cousins finna swing `\Andy +1!!  Doing more than Jason Thompson ever did. `\Durant and Westbrook both got lucky as fuck on that possession

That's all OKC is capable of`\I need to shoot something.`\Mo "Fuck the Thunder" Speights`\He shoots them out of every close game. And WTF were the Thunder thinking trading away Augustine for Foye? Foye is just another guy that seems programmed to shoot, there's no one on OKC that can properly facilitate the ball, including Westbrook because he is a shooting guard. Just because he gets 10 assists a game doesnt mean he's an effective point guard, especially late in games. This whole point guard experiment should have ended long ago if they're incapable of getting Westbrook to make even one smart basketball play at the end of a game. He shot twice as many 3 pointers (8) last night than he averages on the season (4) and I don't recall thinking any one of those 3 pointers was a good open shot that was given to him. IMO the combination of Westbrook's inability to adapt his style of play to the point guard position and wanting to be the man is what gets in the way of the Thunder's success. He was trying to be Curry at times, hence shooting 8 3's. That's just my opinion.`\hi guys`\Where else does he have a better chance aside from GS?`\If OKC hadn't played the 4th quarter, Boston would win by 1. Neat.`\and 4 turnovers`\Anyone else think Marv Albert is bouta choke a bitch?`\Come on Serge...`\Oh my that's brilliant.

Long version: The old owners tried to get funding to fix the arena, and after that failed, sold the team to an investment group from Oklahoma. They tried to get funding for a brand new arena outside of city limits which would have cost twice the price of renovations to the Key. It was a plan designed to fail, as the plan all along was to move the team to OKC. The late Aubrey McClendon was fined $250k by the NBA for saying what everyone was thinking
>McClendon, chief executive of Chesapeake Energy, came under fire after he told the Journal: “We didn’t buy the team to keep it in Seattle, we hoped to come here.

Raptors Dance Pak are probably the best looking cheerleaders in the league. `\that's right, Billy Donovan, smart timeout right there`\LOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOL`\Will Enes ever miss? `\And usually bricks it while streaming "and one"`\I doubt they go deep into the luxury tax`\Travels right after you post this haha. Still overall good game from him`\manw tf is wrong with westbrook`\MO BUCKETS`\I think you got that backwards`\I'm just glad there's no hype on the Nationals.`\Somehow this nails his expression like all the time.`\From what I've seen the subs definition of a rookie is games played`\LOL RONDO`\Durant and Westbrook need to learn they can't just iso the ball and ad-lib plays so much. They're extremely talented so it works out some times, just can't win a title that way. `\I wouldn't jump to any conclusions based on the last half of the 3rd Q. I haven't seen Russ devolve into such shit, and drag the O down with them to such an extent at all this season. `\Which is ridiculous when you realize he averages 11 assists per game. Beast. `\If we start playing shit again put Nazr in, it's why we signed him`\Danny with no regard for spurs fans' mental wellbeing. WTF happened to you :(`\Did Kanter fucked Donovan's wife ?`\It's just 'cause he's backing up a lot quicker now, scared for his cojones.`\Didn't you just reverse jinx yourself...`\Nah`\That's hardly what is happening.`\COME ON CORE, LETS FUCKING GO`\He had like one missed layup and a turnover on 2 Durant passes in the last few minutes....`\Yeah I don't blame sonics fans for being upset. `\Streak was good while it lasted boys.`\Kmart making it 1-11 from 3pt land.`\[KD dish for the Kanter slam](https://streamable.com/obu8)`\God Payne's defense is awful`\Pls no`\What if I told you Billy Donovan was supposed to be an offensive wiz? Maybe, its something else?`\Klay high af`\Oh shit I just came`\raptors have had success against okc the last couple seasons. `\Does he often get into foul trouble?`\What happened that really fucked with Danny? Did he watch Curry be lights out YOLO on all his 3s and feel like "damn, I'm shit at this"... and it affected him? Did he watch Kawhi start progressing to where Kawhi is better at 3s? idk. Something ain't right.`\TOOOOOWWWWNNNNNNSSSSSSSS`\spurs stole our elevator play smh`\I just need them to play like this in the damn playoffs.
`\wtf was that russ.`\Ehh if he's open I don't mind him taking a couple a game`\Lmao that was the worst call I've ever seen.`\That's how it should have gone`\One that's gonna lose Durant.

`\We can both make it without the Rockets being there. ;-)`\Ah, dammit, Ibaka!

Ah, thank you, Adams!`\Keep shooting that Westbrook`\No one knows, but the usual excuse is "his defense is awful." His defense isn't awful though. It's not good by any means, but he gives a ton of effort on defense. Idk why he doesn't play.`\LINKS. NOW.`\Because Curry is much better at those shots. Russell hasn't shot well at 3 pt this season despite launching 4 a game. `\Kanter should have started`\7 turnovers!`\OKC was on a SEGABABA so I cut them some slack`\Singler did a thing!`\You're a stretch 5.`\Lol that 3 shut JVG and MJ up `\There aren't one shot shooting fouls in the NBA. We were at the game and everyone thought it was a 1and1. Too much college basketball.`\OKC's inevitable surge in the 3rd followed by the inevitable GSW comeback in the 4th?`\Is no one going to tell Westbrook that tonight he should stop shooting?`\Sssh. Don't say that too loudly.`\They just don't have what it takes.`\Good start... 0-6`\welp`\Just gotta know where to look ;)`\They do it so they don't lower their fg%`\Not soon enough. `\i like thunders better now `\Man, whatever. Just remember that people will judge you based on the company you keep. `\Barnes clanks`\Why do the Thunder keep forcing those balls in crowded passing lanes?`\coincidently, prince will be at oracle tomorrow.`\Not really the best use for that word. Just sticking up for the celtics flair, I know you beat us by a lot. No need to rub it in. `\Westbrook v Paul! im pumped.`\I have a bad feeling about this`\The offense is just terrible right now.  If they were playing the Warriors, they would be getting blown out. `\What the fuck are they doing haha? That's some amateur stuff.`\4 rebounds, too`\DUKE VS DUKE`\but of course`\Thanks dude I needed a laugh after that debacle`\Green gonna show off his massive hops, here...`\no, because of the BS calls that will inevitably follow`\If Dion plays in it I'm going to be even moreso`\They sure were sold out for GSW/OKC last week, nbatickets`\Ricky is locked in right now`\THE CLAWWWWW`\AWFUL CALL`\Wasn't saying it was a bad call, just that KD didn't get blasted, he stuffed that shit.`\DURANTS THAT GUY`\Ya up until the end where he was just sprinting for layups instead if passing up court.`\I need someone to talk me off this ledge my friend.`\Thunder now 2-of-16 shooting with six turnovers
`\The fuck?`\Yeah KD going for that 'bounce the ball of the opposing players knee and see what happens pass' lol`\OKC the best rebounding team in the league? They gotta be up there. Beasts on the glass.`\WHERE THE WIND COMES SWEEPING DOWN THE PLAIN!`\GG okc, that interior passing was sick this game`\Some Prince impersonation video he made while he was on the Suns I guess. Why? Who knows.`\Where's igoudala`\Yeah, KD had what? 7 turns last night? I'd say at least half of them were due directly to being double and triple teamed because no one else on OKC can shoot reliably.`\Beautiful assist Dion <3`\If you really think fouling every time an opposing player drives to the basket is considered good, smart defending, then sure. Not denying that Collison used to be that type of player, but that was years ago.`\Maybe. We match up with the Raptors without Jae much better than the Thunder without Jae though.`\That's just the Beas Knees right there`\At least the half also ended with some inexplicable calls and no-calls.`\Probably better. Not enough to jump SA, but enough to have a more comfortable cushion from LAC. `\Kanter 6moty, idc Fite me`\paybacks a BITCH......damn, i'll get you next time down :P`\I'm liking this Randy Foye fellow. Doesn't totally transform the team, but he doesn't seem to be exploitably bad at any one thing, which is what we need. `\That's too easy of a fix. Just ask some okc fans. `\Curry flopping like a fish out there`\Basketball brings out the best in people`\#Omg`\It's hilarious that 1.5% is too low to sit through the last minute of game time in the damn finals.  Pitiful that you try to defend it`\Hello 4th quarter Reggie!`\This game is chippy`\Didnt even touch his arm?`\Yeah Danny has been hot trash this year but he's also not been our traditional 3rd option. As long as he's playing defense his cold shooting we can live with. Ibaka is a guy who you would like to get 15/8 out of every night on like .600 FG and he just hasn't been that at all this season.
`\Westbrook just went full 2014 Westbrook. `\GET KANTER AND HUESTIS ON! ffs Donovan do you like watching us play shit?`\The bench came in hella early today...`\What a game. Glad we got the W.`\and 1 livingston`\Pretty hawt`\Pretty easily `\MO Money, MO problems`\God I wish Boogie woulda finished that swing at Adams. He would've got a nasty shock all of sudden looking up at the ceiling. He would've got himself choke slammed.`\If that's the rule to make this decision than half this sub can't make it.

I've watched old games. The dubs are better. `\Lmao he's on the bench`\What!? That's a tough call on Adams!`\Basket made, +10 XP!`\Time for that 4th quarter your turn-my turn basketball by OKC`\It's the Hoopers!`\This is pathetic`\some make up calls lol`\Did the court just light up?`\Fuck lmao `\YES!!! FUCKING SAVED`\Donovan is an idiot for not putting Kanter in over Ibaka, we're like 11-3 when Kanter closes out games for us`\yeah hes strong`\I said it before but the offense on both ends is like ngiht a day`\Weren't they reaching in on Durant?`\But does it have sour cream and cheese on it?`\Haha, yeah. I fucking love it.`\*You're* complaining?  We haven't won a title in almost TWO years.  TWO.  `\Donovan :/`\Lol officiating my ass. We have been attacking the paint while you guys have been shooting jumpers. All of your paint points are mainly put backs.`\He does it every other game `\This is the kind of start I like!`\him standing around at the 3 point line chucking ill advised 3's every damn game`\Kerr convincing kd `\too soon, they are still in a fragile state`\LMAOOOOOO`\Yup. Everyone watched Durant run around and forgot about Ibaka. lol `\It's a picture in the box at the top of the thread `\Predictions for 2nd half: Major run by the Thunder against the worst possible lineup imaginable.

especially since they just foul dwight if he doesnt immediately put it in the hoop`\cripple double westbrook`\mo threes`\Kanter gets all the boards`\Sniper`\The whistles were totally fine til like halfway through the 4th.`\I think you gotta keep Russ in the game, he just has to play smarter. If he's shooting poorly, he should be getting to the rim and drawing fouls, penetrating and dishing and making his teammates better. Instead, he just kept jacking bad shots - or at least, if not bad shots, shots that were ill advised. I know sometimes a guy can shoot himself out of a slump, but when Russ was 4 for 18, he should have started attacking and dishing to KD, Kanter and Adams.

I do agree that Morrow needs to see more time. Obviously Roberson's individual D is negated when the other four guys on the floor don't play defense, so they might as well put Morrow in, because he'd probably hit those two open looks from three the Roberson missed. Or at least he would have spread the floor and given KD and Russ a little more room to work.

Aside from that, Kanter and Waiters were practically invisible. Singler had a decent game, for Singler, but it was far from enough to keep them in it.`\Curious as to why there are two threads.

GO JAZZ`\Curry is like Durant, but shorter. Goddamn he shot over Dwight Howard contesting a 3 pointer.`\Is Westbrook wearing skinny jeans?`\In b4 every celtics fan gets downvoted in the post game thread.`\That's exactly why.`\that's the spirit!`\There's that Triple Double bae`\Doesn't sound like you've watched much of them this year. They still have flaws but "iso basketball" is absolutely not one of them. They do get iso heavy at times but no more than any other team other than gsw/SAS

Much different team than last year. No Lou will biggest change but other stuff matters

I also wouldn't really say iso ball was the biggest reason they lost to WAS, though it didn't help`\[Russ dumps it off for the Kyle slam](https://streamable.com/ybzk)`\Westbrook you a bad man.`\Refs don't be like that`\35 REVERSE AGAIN

It's a bizon.`\I'm surprised they never guessed Hakeem. Thought it would be obvious, but I'm a rockets fan lol. `\Actually that's true `\Anybody hear what Donovan was yelling at Roberson?`\We can make an assumption that other teams would go 0-8.... and it wouldn't be too far from the truth`\Enes the meanest penis Kanter had a really nice game today, 18/12 in 18 minutes `\The refs were making up for the bad call on Adams, he was fouled`\I think luc was greatly underrated. He was so solid and consistent. He'd take the best player and make it easier on the rest. `\Ibaka too.`\Adams' D on Boban was really impressive. Made a very efficient scorer waste possessions. Great boxes too.`\Irony.`\Why does Westbrook always look like he smells shit?`\But they didn't lose.  Cavaliers are on that second tier too imo.  How you lose to the grizzlies.. Smh `\Welcome to the Speights jam.`\this kills the thunder.`\I mean we've never seen someone as offensively skilled in outside the paint scoring as curry. `\That automatic switch Huestis and Cam have been doing between Harris and Blake is a bad, bad idea. Only really burned us badly once, but you can't keep doing it.`\Nope.. Just the Thunder. `\People are "dying off" if thats what you mean. `\I hate him.`\I think it's pretty obvious that it's Durant. Westbrook is fucking awesome, but he goes bananas way too often in the crunch time. Durant is more reliable.`\If Nik scores 20+, I consider this a win`\Here's the [box score](http://www.basketball-reference.com/boxscores/200704070NJN.html)`\Heating up`\lol draymond doesn't get Ted up like his behavior demands`\lol good defense OKC`\He was going for a two for one and it was open. Not really dumb.`\NOW THAT IS WHAT I CALL A GOOD SEQUENCE`\"And when he keeps coming"`\We've figured out that problem.  30+ point lead going into the fourth.`\after that awful game he had against the warriors, they just don't play Payne. I think he's better than Foye `\That's a good decision actually.`\No fucking way.`\Lets go westtttt`\Hopefully Thunder aint too gassed `\4/15`\Is there a referee in the ring? Like MMA rules or boxing or something? Or is it just a street fight?`\RJ sniper is about to drop 20 straight `\lmao Manu with them Veteran moves`\Ibaka's clearly a dirty player, but it's only with a select few players so it mostly goes unnoticed. `\Curry-Stopper 2.0`\Both Steph and Klay poor 3 pt shooting tonight, just like their first home game versus OKC. `\That's game! Dagger!`\For all his offensive woes (deservedly so), at least Scott Brooks had the team consistently competing defensively. They were an elite defensive team with him around which gave him at least a little credibility. Now, the offense remains the same as under Brooks, yet now they even lack the defense which Brooks brought. Against the majority of the teams in the league, this works given the insane amount of talent OKC has. But to beat the best teams in the league when it counts, playing 48 mins of KD/Russ isos accompanied by an under-performing defense just wont cut it.`\How was Kanter ?`\CALL A FUCKING FOUL`\RUBIO IS LOVE, RUBIO IS LIFE.`\To add on to what the other guy said, some coaches also have a tendency to consistently yell the play to the PG and the PG then executes it after signaling to the rest of the team.`\Call me old-fashioned, but that was a really dumb play by Paul.  It's one thing to just pass to the open 3 with a defender in front of you on the fast break, it's a whole different game when you're literally right at the hoop for the open layup.`\lol what the fuck was that`\I'm dipping Oreos in chocolate milk and I can feel the diabetes taking over.`\I giggled`\and an easy layup in the lane apparently.`\warriors fans complaining over questionable calls? give me a break`\god damn shelvin does some really stupid shit sometimes`\one idiot`\But that was with Russ or KD spreading the floor for them. `\She irritates me `\Fire Donovan he is so much worse than Brooks.`\You just proved his point...`\Livingston has Vulcan ears...`\Its ugly man`\I don't see how people think OkC is GS's best challenge anymore`\Our offense is pathetic. `\24/8/8 on 9/14 after 3 Qs. Yeah he's decent.`\I turned off stream for a few minutes now it's only single digit lead?`\That doesn't make it any better.  It just sounds fucking stupid to me`\Dude I honestly think half of this sub was barely watching the NBA until the last five years.`\KD to everywhere is every game thread `\horrible call holy cow`\[SINGL3R](https://streamable.com/sxnq)

When Crowder gets back, of course.`\adams and kanter shouldve been together from the start. fuck small ball and fuck singler`\Our dudes are the most homer`\This makes me very happy`\The Thunder get lost on every off-ball movement, especially involving Klay. `\hard to run an offense when they can get away with more on defense than us. :/`\Lmao this team withot KD is worse than the sixers`\Bricking mad shots.`\Roberson had all day for that three. `\That's bull`\Danny STOP!!!`\We are tue 2nd best offense in the league because we have 2 of the top 5 players in the league, and that would still be happening with BD or with my grandma as head coach. Amo's defense isn't bad at all and he's the best shooter we have.

Kanter's defense isn't worse than Ibaka's this season yet he still plays a lot more.

Today's lineup was made of Westbrook and 4 guys who can't score if they aren't given easy balls, even a 5 yo kid knows you can't win with that lineup`\That was a back handed compliment :)`\Lol Aaron Lewis is a country singer now. `\I would have been so hyped if Steph just dunked it all over ibaka there lol`\Shit ya'll, its a back to back for OKC, cut em some slack`\Should have found an old bear to call you honey and finance that shit.`\Don't worry. It looks like you'll be seeing the Warriors in the second round.`\But he's gone too far now`\Others do a much better job than Smart is doing and with all the talking up he gets I thought he would be able to do better.`\Not a foul at all`\Props to the Wolves.  They looked great today.

I'm still not sure if we're a good team anymore.  24 turnovers is pathetic.`\Just had one. Am dead. AMA`\are the Spurs playing soccer?`\[fuuuuckkkk Kevin duraaaaant](http://youtu.be/HBQ2mjkvYY8)`\Bad stretch.

Just one.`\Do fans generally like this or is it not well received?`\"2 threes, both from long range" no shit lmao`\state farm commercials are god damn hilarious`\Cavs fan too `\THE HELL KIND OF BAILOUT CALL IS THAT`\Gotta take your lumps when you put up a performance like this.`\I definitely wouldn't pay Ibaka big money again.`\does /u/timduncanthealmighty still do spurs gifs? if so man you gotta hook us up with the duncan throwing gang signs gif.`\SIMPLE JACK WITH THE SLAM`\that face is going to give me nightmares`\Jesus we need some consistency on these calls.  That was a weak ass call on Ibaka.

I'm at the pub with a handful of GS dudes and they are even laughing how its 8 on 5 right now. Christ,  let some banging go down. Bogut and Dray have done the same shit all night`\Pretty insane how the rest of the team is on fire when steph and klay went cold tonight.  Just too deep.`\When I think of a statue of Duncan all I can picture is something 150 feet tall`\Rick and Morty?`\Donovan has gotten more and more confused as the season goes on. `\Westbrook + KD + Enes

Westbrook is beasting!

Good performance from the thunder tonight!

Cheers`\KCP has put in work against opposing guards this season.`\I don't get it. We actually run something resembling an offense at times. If they would just ease up on the hero ball...`\Same thing that has cost us a lot of games. Ball stops moving in the fourth. We had probably 5 turnovers just from trying to make a heavily broadcasted pass to KD or Russ without any set-up. Just them standing still with their hands out waiting for the ball. 5 doesn't sound like a lot, but there were at least a dozen tips in that fourth quarter alone, we took maybe 3 actual good shots.`\OKC right now...
http://i.imgur.com/z43FGlv.gifv`\I get your point.  I didn't call OKC  a non-contender  because they're 3rd seed. It's because they obviously don't have what it takes to get past those two teams. Cle  does.

And after what LeBron  did in the finals last year I'm astonished that people still write off the cavs. Makes no sense. Regular  season doesn't mean shit. `\It is extremely dangerous.

Best for both sides.`\Nice!`\You're my favorite Thunder fan.`\Please give Enes more minutes when he's balling out, we aren't paying him the max to chain him to the bench `\Definitely KD.`\that was a carry, but he let it go cuz they called a foul on that clean block.`\So do the winners face princes crew?

I'm not a GSW fan, I'm merely admiring Curry's ridiculous shooting. I'm a Laker fan so I guess Kobe's 81 on your Raptors still makes you a little anal.`\lmao we have the best starting 5 in the whole league. For 5-man lineups MP > 300, we are the best.

Roberson is one of the top 1-4 defenders in the whole league. Serviceable on paint offense. Still needs to chuck up more 3s.`\How do you let Jamal Crawford get his own rebound?`\Lol Durant keep leave the Thunder alone for 3 minutes`\Refs really want to get gws over the line`\CUCKOLD THE CONDOR ERA BEGINS`\Its easy when that bench player comes on the court and loses a 9 point lead in two minutes cause of lack of defense and two bad shots.`\Chin up dude.

How do you guys upload these replays so quickly?`\Yeah we only play him at the 4 against big frontlines (Memphis, etc.)`\Apparently a 35 reverse will be occurring`\Yeah, that lineup needed a front court scorer.`\it is incredible the Thunder are only 5 points down the way they are playing`\watch out tampa bay`\Too bad the refs couldn't save your team.

:/`\Notes from the game:

This Warriors team is going to be a team I’ll proudly tell my kids that I hated. But goddamn are they an incredible team to watch.

We got the bad Westbrook tonight. Dude thought he was Curry but couldn’t make a three to save his life. Why shoot that many threes when you’re having such an off night *and* you have KD on fire? And when the bench is playing well for once! Hell, I would’ve rather see anyone else shoot those threes tonight, that’s how off he was.

Something about this team is just off, I don’t like seeing it. They don’t deserve a top 5 seed. Even when they keep it close against the best team in the league I still don’t trust them. Even if they had won tonight, I still wouldn’t trust them. They just can’t keep it together in close games. I’ve never felt this way about this team when they’ve been healthy.

/rant`\> What do you mean "when was the last time we beat a good team?"

We havent beet a top seeded team since the opening game.`\Adams is having some dunk trouble lol`\God damn our color guy is the fucking worst. `\Dion missing layups  has to be a meme at this point. He is a walking missed layup.`\I need whiskey`\defense is stifling.  When it turns up teams panic.`\Steph is at that Kobe level where anything under 50 points just isn't a memorable night. `\So why didn't those people leave when they would've been perfectly justified in leaving according to you?`\I'm so tired of wanting to be a good team `\Everyone knew Durant was going to pull up for a 3 there. `\Dubs look like they're sleepwalking...hero ball homeruns is all they got.`\WE NEEDED THAT`\My god so many turnovers.  `\They definitely did, but no backcourt violation for the Warriors`\lmao bro i've been saying that for a minute now, glad i'm not the only one recognized it`\Such a risky pass KD`\that was as clean as it gets lol `\Were those OKC chants?`\he's not wrong, the cavs gave the warriors fits for 3 quarters every game in the finals until they were exhausted because they had no one to sub in, also gave them fits in the first game

the problem is there's only like 2 really 'good' defensive teams, and they happen to be the only two teams who can beat the warriors in the spurs and cavs`\Greg Monroe cries a lot`\Feel free to argue that he isn't one of the best perimeter defenders in the league, and that he can't hold his own in the paint against nearly anybody.

Not defensive about it, but watch a few games before you say that because of what Durant is doing. That's my point. `\I feel like Westbrook is in Reggie Jackson's head. Like he's his dad or something`\Yeah usually he plays westbrook pretty well. Once he develops his 3 shot hes going to turn into Bledsoe. `\I'd love it if we could get 1 minute of uninterrupted play please ref`\Everyone calling Dwight innocent like he's a 9 year old kid. The dude is 30 he should know the rules. `\don't worry Norman will get the refs respect when he wins the finals MVP this year`\lol what`\I think the point is that for the Spurs to even get the one seed they'd have to try and win every game AND hope another team beats the Warriors a few times, since SA only has two games vs GS left.

In other words, as far as the two seed is concerned we're locked into it since we don't really control our destiny for the one seed. That's why Pop has focused on keeping the main guys fresh and the bench motivated.`\Kanter is 9-9 tonight and hasn't missed a shot in three games. That's incredible.`\Glad Westbrook got that out of his system`\I learned that Westbrook only takes mid range jumpers`\It's too obvious lol`\That was the worst possible shot Westbrook could have taken. Might as well have gotten the easy lay up in transition. `\What about Luke?`\[Giannis block](https://streamable.com/7fxi)`\Just started watching. Have the refs been this bad all game?`\what the fuck are these fouls refs`\Lmao
`\NINE TIMES`\He had the audacity to celebrate that`\Notice how Morrow comes in for Singler and Dion hits a 3 and got a block shot...

Im not lying when I say that Foye and Singler makes others around them just as shitty as them `\He's not great, but next to McGary he looks like Marc Gasol. `\Yeah his mediocre style is still giving him 28 ppg 7 ast`\OKC just can't execute down the stretch, Donovan getting out coached`\And the UK and Australia`\Lol.  Then we got what we deserve`\Hope it's just a funny bone `\Withey is such a solid backup C. I wish he got more playing time!`\What the fuck`\3 fouls lmao`\4th quarter Russ incoming `\gg spurs`\Move over Steph`\Omg Curry. Wtf. `\LOL!`\That's the point of it`\Having a deep bench and having year-long stamina is part of being a great team. `\/u/splash2ndcousin   get in here fam!`\Please tell me Huestis will get more minutes tonight. `\VINTAGE SERGE`\First gif:
> Rubio with the least intimidating intro ever

Last gif:
> Rubio winner

There's just a beautiful irony in that!

Thanks for doing these too by the way! Great work!`\Hell no, he wouldn't look like Borat anymore`\Fucking stupid ass Foye you need to get Westbrook that assist there`\Randy lmao`\it feels like the warriors just clinched the nba title tonight `\That's when I knew it was over`\You don't know the nightmare getting on BART is after a game in that complex.  A's games, Raiders games, and Warriors games can be brutal getting to the BART station.  That is the main reason they leave.  If the game is in the bag, and with the W's if they have a late lead it is pretty much a 100% prediction at this point, they are thinking about waoking across tat bridge and standing on that platform with 8k people.`\After what he did to Curry last time we faced detroit? Wtf I would expect his perimeter defense to be at least a B+ `\Bradley out of fuckin' nowhere`\Man,Westbrook is quick.`\He will sign a one year extension for sure.`\Is Oklahoma City "country?"`\I wonder if BD is that worried about us blowing another 4th quarter lead. Let KD sit. If this bench can't hold a ~30 point lead, send them all to the D-League.`\This free throw differential is already making me nervous.`\Bullshit. Bull fucking shit`\We won the last game, and this should be a blow out`\wonder if the ankle is still bugging him`\Do we tie the bulls record for home win streak if we win tonight?`\New NBA law:

If you have Andre anywhere in your first name, you will become a clutch FT shooter against the Thunder in the 4th, even if you normally suck  donkey balls at FTs. `\Why isn't Bradley on Westbrook?`\Weird game. I feel like both teams have played bad and deserve to lose. Westbrook needs to chill on them 3's. `\So much money from merchandise they happily pay luxury tax. Or we are fucked lol`\Me too`\KD is so money too. It's not like it was just a bad shot. It was a bad shot while you're standing next to a late-game-3 clutch mofo`\This is probably the most predictable result I could have imagined for this game`\darn, it wasn't even original but thanks! glad you laughed`\Nice meme`\Glad Russ is alright`\Wow refs fucking us so hard`\For some reason I respect this so much more because you're a Warriors fan saying this`\why isnt kanter closer to speights body. Hes far more a threat to shoot than drive`\55-5`\If we're up by 25+ going into the 4th, I don't worry. Anything less and I'm nervous. `\I think that was the longest I've ever seen two teams play their garbage time lineups.  Really happy Payne got as much burn (even before garbage time) as he did.  `\Donovan, Y U no Kanter?`\Ibaka pls.`\how does green not have a fucking technical this game? this is absolutely ridiculous `\Oh lol `\Maybe I'm just missing it, but people seem pretty chill in this thread. I'm a fan of both (bigger fan of GS), and I don't know why anyone should have a problem with either.`\I've been optimistic about OkC but they suck real bad at closing out games. Holy crap`\>argues on /r/NBA about GOAT point guards

>speaks to attractive women

>pick one

We've made our choice `\Kind of extreme but I see where you're coming from. Especially since the dynamic duo has attracted this criticism for years.`\Let's dispel the notion that Steph Curry doesn't know what he's doing in the 3rd quarter. He knows exactly what he's doing.`\Dogs are evolving man this halftime entertainment got me shook`\commentators are trash `\That sexy finish ��`\holy fuck rebound the ball`\Russ has a wicked euro step`\Every NBA PA guy does that.  That and blaring music during gameplay takes so much away from the game and makes it seem like a circus act to me.  The assault on the senses at NBA games really takes away from the atmosphere in my opinion.`\OKC Offense:

1) Durant and Westbrook Iso

2) Drive and kick`\Airballed a three and then bricked one back to back. Someone please tell Russell to not shoot threes...`\come onnnnnnnnnnnn miracle run`\Absolutely horrendous second quarter`\It takes a special kind of player to be 5-9 for 10 points and pull 2 rebounds in the 1q and still be overall negative to your team due to no defense or effort`\Russell Westbrook is slowly becoming Rajon Rondo lol `\man oh man... I know you might not have meant anything by it.. But someone could take this the wrong way `\Chris Paul > Westbrook regardless of what stats say`\He hasn't exactly been Steph Curry this season.`\Yeah, but dunking off of trampolines...`\It's just how it was and still sort of is, it's just not as brutal anymore since they drug test and more players are focused on being super fast vs. big and swoll. It's like asking why the clock goes up in soccer. It just does idk. They kinda fight on a sort of honor system. You can find videos on youtube of the players mic'd up fighting. Sometimes they just want to fight each other for fun. Sometimes they kind of 'have to'. I mean they could ask to be taken out I'm sure, but then they'll be treated like a bitch by any team that finds out if they pulled that. It's sort of an unwritten rule to keep big ass 6'4'' defenseman skating full speed and trucking into 5'8'' skinny wingers while they're not looking....because then the team might put a fighter in to harrass you for the next period and no one wants to deal with that shit. `\McGary>Singler

C'mon Donovan, give the people what they want`\I agree, but I'm getting less confident Carroll is coming back.  And with Ross out and Lowry playing hurt, our spacing could be in a really bad place in the playoffs.`\That was last night. It's clear as a bell right now, around 5 degrees.

Edit: whoosh`\We're sloppy and lazy tonight, imo.

We've been back to form on this winning streak, but tonight, we're back to playing how we have been for the majority of our post All-Star games`\You think the kings would be better off without Cousins? Lmao`\Maybe, but he's our piece of shit`\westbeast's statline looks like something straight out of MyCareer lol`\basketball-reference.com, mess around there`\Yup, the game in which he clinched the scoring title. [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5dmc2hngMU).`\Really like the spurs' defensive effort so far`\Tbh honest the defense was pretty crap last season under Brooks, Perkins is the real loss here`\That was bad `\The Dubs are just gonna match up with whoever Kanter/Waiters are guarding`\Curry is ruthless.`\"Yes."`\Is it just me or was Dwight fouled on the pass?`\Spurs shot like 16% on threes and are still going to win.
edit:  okc shot 11%`\I agree`\Lol that one guy bringing up freethrow disparity withou context like its indicative of something `\Ask BD`\"Fuck this gay earth"`\Obviously fair choice, but Leonard's impact just seemed so prominent today while Durant seemed to appear in spurts and wasn't very evident in the  4th`\Bro fuck these refs`\I still prefer

GO**LLLLL**DEN STATE **WWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW**ARRIORS!`\Atleast you guys can get leads :(`\[Guardzilla on the run](https://streamable.com/vm44)`\Yeah I dunno about that call. It's like that same call that Adams got called on a few games back.`\Jason Aldean making me feel things`\Danny missing, Kawhi missing. This is not good. `\You got free points off that shit foul call on Kawhi. Let it go the games over.`\Why is it so hard to hate steph :(`\He's still a far better option than Dion or Foye. I mean KD literally asked for a point guard the other day because Foye cant dribble`\lmao ouch that hurts`\Come on Warriors, get some buckets now`\Gotta protect the league's golden boys.`\Just Donovan things...`\Hustle Westbrook.`\It isn't just KCP. Whole team is working well to make life difficult for him.`\We can't even run a fastbreak FML`\The Kings also once had a transcendent rookie big man in addition to the reigning ROY. `\God damn we're hot tonight`\yamtradamus has spoken.`\i respectfully disagree, i like JMM to see the floor but not ALL of Mo's minutes. They tried giving Varejao all of Mo's minutes and it wasn't pretty. But we should trust the staff, it's obvious they're looking for something else but he's the best we got. And while we got him we should support him.`\Beat me to it.`\When I watch RW vs. the average team during a regular season game, he's definitely turned the corner, as he patiently shreds defense with an incredible combo of scoring, passing, and raw athleticism. But when he plays from behind, he still goes back to old Westbrook and on a team where there's almost no ball movement, the Thunder will likely struggle a lot in the playoffs vs the Clips Spurs and Warriors.`\Oklahoma really bombed in the fourth`\We aren't playing great we are just running a lot.`\Ay Russell yelled AND ONE before he even got the ball.`\He's been working with Adrian Payne. Only possible explanation. `\Makes a lot more sense, it was confusing that the PG just KNOWS what the coach would call in any given situation`\Dude I was playing around haha too soft`\You're kidding, right?`\[35 REVERSE!](https://streamable.com/q4op)`\Draymond wouldn't get a tech even if he mooned the ref`\Hoping dwaiters can take this into the playoffs. He's so fun to watch when he's playing confidently`\Don't worry Toronto, Singler's back. `\I'd sincerely be surprised if any coach gave a shit about analytics.`\Yeah, did you not just see him get absolutely smoked?`\You can't hold onto someones leg while on the ground.`\I miss him :(`\Ballmer is a better mascot than Connor the Condor.`\NBA needs to record hockey assists`\stupid salty fan probably. i love the dude. i want to have his metaphorical babies.
