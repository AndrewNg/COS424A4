harden 5 steals dwight 5 blocks`\i guess once you get kicked out you can say whatever you want.....`\Not even close.  We're missing 7 out of our top 9 guys. Think about that. `\He's been out the game for too long at this point .`\we can definitely give the thunder a series`\I really don't understand why Marcus Smart is the player on the Celtics you choose to criticize when he and Winslow have almost identical flaws`\so trey lyles *wasnt* fouled on that drive? at any point?

thats what we're going with?`\Thank you Rockets.`\Had to sit this one out as the player so that he could come in as the coach.`\Weird call`\And 1 assist away from tying his assist record he set the other night.`\Every time he hit a wide open shooter they just bricked it. Kyrie was the only consistent player on the cavs tonight besides James Jones.`\Hood and Favors came up huge tonight. `\Hahahahahahaha`\I don't know how he turned that into a dunk lol`\Thas a great movie

http://youtu.be/0isvq7-vBqk`\He alway sways forward. It's part of why his form is so silky smoove. `\Great grind it out game by Houston tonight. But serious question, I don't watch many Houston games, but where's the crowd?`\Lol everyone in Canada knows there were never Dinosaurs here, everyone is just trolling you.`\[ricky is cute boy, but peep this adonis](http://www.rantsports.com/nba/files/2015/01/USATSI_8196599_149008644_lowres.jpg)`\harden bout to cook matt barnes a poo-poo platter`\LIN for the win!!!`\WHOOOOOOOOO YEAAAAAAHBHHH`\Lue is 22-10 as a coach, why all the hate?`\goberts a pussy. weak ass mother fucker`\Hes not in NBA shape`\Anyone who pushes Tony Snell outta the rotation is fine by me`\KHA$H`\That was a close one.`\Is CWebb calling him Timothy?`\Well people tried telling me he wasnt a top 3 SG lol because of "bad defense"`\I mean to be fair it was a disgusting game`\Oh God, here comes the Leo rant on "get JV the ball."`\I meant in general `\Ohhhhh cut it out. He didn't move from where he landed. Jae does the flex every now and again... not something pointed toward the opponent in any case. `\Started the game with his usual trapping the ball handler which Rockets fans have complained about to death. Amongst other things, dug the team a hug hole and he finally had the presence of mind to stop and Rockets went on a big run to take a 6pt lead into the half from a 15 deficit at the end of the first. Of course team started trapping again in the 4th and they got blown out. He also decided to stick Terry on Schroeder for like 5 minutes with DMo as the center and ATL scored on every possession. I'm not sure who's calling the constant switching, they switch everything for no reason, ended up with Bev on Millsap multiple times which led to layup or open 3s every possession. They also switch the bigs onto the 3pt line to guard the guards and surprisingly Dwight didn't do terribly like before. Won't even talk about his terrible rotations again, especially considering it's a B2B and end of a 3 in 4. Completely winnable game even with the turnovers and missed 3 pointers.



`\I mean, being one of the top 3 teams certainly makes them a front runner but maybe not the front runner.`\Smfh ��`\LETS FUCKING GO AAAaaa

I thought we were doomed because Houston started trying on defense from the start until waiting until the 4th quarter. When they have the defensive effort they look just as good or better than last year's squad. What a win!`\Fucking JV. Misses a point blank shot`\If it works out and they get married she'll only have to change one letter in her name...`\Flagrant lmfao`\Huh?`\Dats gross.`\looking forward to improving the rockets 3point % with this game.

love our perimeter defense`\According to DMO apparently they do`\Who knows at this point. He had the same surgery as Brandon Wright at around the same time so hopefully he is back soon.`\harden is legit so lethal, amount of disrespect he gets is disgusting`\Definitely `\Wiggins was terrible down the stretch. Turnover machine.`\Gordon is fucking trash `\those celtic boys stalk the hairgod too. they think because brad stevens is there and because utah OBVIOUSLY is a terrible place to live, hayward will just scoot on over to boston`\https://twitter.com/WolstatSun/status/704322052271022080

we've been 23rd in defensive rating the past 10 games`\Luv u too bb`\I mean kind of hard to call us a bottom West team when we are 1/2 game out of the 8 seed.  But yeah we have played like shit post ASB

Honestly it looks like you guys aren't used to the other team moving the ball`\With Bayless back? Nah man, Bayless is still a better PG`\Wow, the Bulls are making a ton of stupid mistakes this game. Gasol and Rose with 6 turnovers, and Jimmy with 4. `\So will Bev get his 5x5 before or after his quad double?`\I fear we'll both be disappointed tonight. `\Care to make a wager on that?
`\that front court's been mediocre at best all year long`\Have you seen his career resume? It's not about how he is now it's about his career and if you actually cared to look at the stuff he did in Orlando that would be a fucking easy question. Usually I agree with you but you're just flat out wrong on this one.`\Haygod or Prince Hood time `\I told myself I wouldn't look at the Post game thread, why am I doing this to myself...`\Harden's a much better passer than Kobe ever was. I don't buy into that narrative. I'm sure his teammates love playing with him. He's the guy getting them open look after open look.

Pretty tired of Dwight on the offensive end, though. If he's not catching lobs, he's pretty useless at this point. Can't catch a bounce pass to save his life. And his defense isn't worth keeping him around at his current salary.

I'm good with missing the playoffs. Keep the first as an asset, let Morey do Morey things with the cap space.`\By far. Like do those people see the state the Browns are in? We might now even win a game this season and people are really crying about our team being 52-22 and only first in the East.

I laugh when people call Cleveland fans the most loyal fanbase in America because every time we taste success we cry and whine and moan. Same thing happened with Hoyer a couple years ago, 7-7 just wasn't good enough`\I just don't get this Cavs team.. Do they just have a severe case of the Monday's every week this Spring? `\lol, so that first half turned into a nice Easter afternoon nap. yay for highlights

glad we're up, don't fuck it up Pacers`\H TINE HOL IT DINE`\WE WON A FIRST QUARTER! DROP THE CONFETTI! POP THE BOTTLES! DON'T EVER UNDERESTIMATE THE HEART OF A CHAMPION!`\WOW did Beasley just outrun IT?`\you know you are losing it when you mistake a player for another one, don't correct yourself, but call him by his real name during the same offensive run without noticing at all. `\Bad call. Not a flagrant.

Ps. <3 you AD`\Lol... For what it's worth I hope you make the playoffs `\jimmer`\That's crazyshe's the one who gave Harden a vote for DPOY a couple years back. I wonder if that was sarcastic lol`\No, hes just tired. We just beat #2 and #3 seed in the east in the same week on the road. This won't happen again, Harden was just tired. `\thats awesome. `\Get. Out. Of. Here. `\Beasley is wrecking us!`\Yet he keeps getting the ball to make decisions`\of course he goes 6/6 until now`\Let me just read this post but also be blind at the same time. All you've done all night is bitch bitch bitch. `\That's a great call, he hooked his arm. Fuck.`\COME ON WTF MIDDS GIVE THE BALL FFS`\hahahahaha what`\That's happened like 37 times this season, why is that a surprise to you?`\dont need defense if you score more points`\raptors playing like the softest contenders ever`\Someone needs to Gif that domination`\But guys the question we all want to know is...was James harden partying last night ?!`\The ~~race~~ crawl to playoffs?`\Sorry but that trumpet anthem was brutal.`\no lead is safe`\I guess Kahwi doesn''t play in this league? Or Rudy Gobert? Or Draymond?`\I totally forgot about the small amount of time after the 5-0 start. Went to that NY game and things looked pretty bad at that point (2-6 after 5-0). Good thing the Raps turned it up.`\Great guy faves`\14 of 17 but whos counting...`\Scola!`\Dang last time I checked Mavs up by like 20 lol `\MAKE EM' DANCE, LANCE!`\Forget Paris man`\The fuck is that bullshit?`\Harden not a top 10 player huh /r/nba? Foh`\Only by a little bit, Harden has the higher usage rate and turns the ball over way more, plus Harden doesn't have a guy like Westbrook on his team that does a lot of the assisting`\Like we did to you twice this season?`\Quietest crowd I've heard this season`\Kyle is lucky there is enough contact where he won't get fined`\why does harden always miss Tech free throws`\Dei Lynam, daughter of former Sixers coach Jim Lynam.`\Remember that time when the Warriors and Blazers combined for 140 in a half? Lol.`\KJ FOR 3 WTF`\Lowry does the same thing, if he doesn't get the board he always goes for a steal on the big and then has to run back on D.`\Come back from 18 deficit. Come on OP gotta mention that! `\So will the Cavs/Jazz/Mavericks

Everyone wins`\Wait, who's team are you on kid? James Harden is a beast and he broke up with that hoe `\Of course!`\BEASLEY TAKING THE ROCKETS TO THE FINALS`\Hornets have some hot cheerleaders`\When Jared Bayless is the only capable scorer off your bench, you're in trouble.

There are a ton of less selfish Jared Baylesses in the league.`\ATHREEEZA `\He was averaging a 20-20 vs the Clippers this season and they won't even look for him tonight`\CoJo was in no mans land, gave up the open three`\I swear if brewer lost that ball I would rip my eyebrows off`\Come on cavs `\Lue is a joke, he really thinks this old ass team can run`\Before the game, the announcers said something to the effect that Toronto since January had the most steals in the league. with the way this game is going, we are going to be padding those stats.`\fuck warriors are 60 - 6`\I hate him. He's dirty af`\lmao Dwight slapped Josh

#GOOD OLE AUU TEAMMATES`\Most of that negative pub. was speculative which is disappointing. `\C'mon man, he had a near quadruple double tonight, cut him some slack.`\He's never played this many minutes in a season and is probably wearing down a little bit. On top of that, other teams figured out he can easily put up 20+ and he's a player opposing defenses now plan for on their scouting reports.`\Since our offense is so inconsistent, it really comes down to defense. And last night our offense was looking just okay, but we put the clamps down on defense at the tail end of the third and whole fourth quarter`\We need the Pistons to beat the shit out of the mavs`\GG!`\You guys have such a fun team. Hope you make noise in the playoffs.`\I'm cumming.`\Thread says there are 19 comments but I can't read any of them.`\>its still interesting

I agree completely, I'm just salty that they didn't tie up in losses today. `\3MOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO`\And reviewing for flagrant? wtf are these refs doing?`\This is why I should always turn off the game when we're leading by a lot.  I can't remember the last time we held a 20 point lead.  `\Rodney is great when the clock is running low. Too bad he's been cold.`\Like our players, our fans seem to constantly feel victimized by the refs for whatever reason`\Yeah I am lol. She's corner courtside opposite the Raps bench. Red dress. Big tits. `\\#MakeDonaldDrumpfAgain`\bullard had a stroke `\Does traveling not apply after a foul?`\We only down 9, no reason to panic right :///////`\What exactly is the Lean In movement advocating for? What is their goal?`\Lowry a fool`\jason terry is trying to murder our whole team wtf`\Montrezl needs minutes regularly. Right now.`\Lol`\Kyrie gave it up`\It might be time to say that both KLove and Kyrie Irving might not be "winning" ballplayers. They might be more Monta Ellis types...rather than DWade types...`\/u/HoustonSucks 2nd account?`\Hitler at it again`\CoJo needs to take Jet when he's guarding him that close`\Yeah it's been an unfortunate development this year. `\wow...um....mistakes of a young team?

That was almost as bad as Hillary.`\They were probably talking about the collision they had`\I feel like it might be time for the NBA to take a look at our training/conditioning. Sure, it could all be a huge coincidence, but... Seriously?!`\We're fucked. You know what they do at halftime, right? Team meeting.

gg rocketbros `\Rashad is so chill `\I agree. People constantly knock him for his defense. I would say that for 6 feet and under, IT is a very solid defender. `\Who woulda thought the bench screwed us again. Same story still no changes. Smh.`\Theyre taking into account his college ball too where he was a prolific scorer. `\well r/NBA fucking hates him so not sure how he's overrated. `\https://streamable.com/gcmg`\Doesnt/didn't Doris Burke call games for espn? She's the only other one I can think of`\Hubie definitely seemed oddly homer-ish for some reason.`\Didn't realize y'all had so many D-Leaguers on the roster right now. I can't imagine how demoralizing that would be for the players ):`\C'mon...You can't possibly think he doesn't have a reason. He's been pushed so much this quarter alone. One tech ok..a second is unnecessary `\Trey please stop`\To be fair, the Rockets make any team look like an all star team.`\I know, I know. Those are nice, though.`\MOOCHIE AT THE HALF! SOMETHING GOOD IS COMING OUT OF THIS GAME! `\He just seems like he is a jack of all trades. Not really super outstanding at anything(apparently his defense isn't that great this year) but pretty good at everything. `\I'm sitting here freshly out of college with a 9-5 and loving this early start time`\SG yes, players no way!`\fuck this whole season. fuck the mavs. fuck the andersons.`\Buckle up, this game might last 5 hours.`\wow lol we're not playing defense`\astronaut > drake`\we know that no lead is safe for us`\Makes you realize how good and important NBA players are*`\but his piggyback play will`\It's actually hilarious how easily the Jazz give up these leads. It's as if they're doing it on purpose.`\Has anyone seen Tyler Zeller and Domas Sabonis in the same room?`\Yup, inconsistency is a hallmark of young teams. We'll grow. `\Now help us tomorrow please.`\Beverly at it again, dirty fucker`\Shhh... it's a secret`\Consensus is they're the worst or close to it.`\Tommy: now Beasley was a very high draft choice

It would be great for us down the stretch.  I like what DMo has been up to so far tonight regardless of who he's been on the court with up front. `\holy fuck ariza is almost as tall as Plumlee`\Hayward just got bitched`\Chicago `\Who knows. It's first to 4 and the Cavs will very likely be in the Finals to roll the dice. I agree they're only the 3rd best team, I mean how could you not agree with that after this game. But as they say, "that's why they play the game(s)."`\Scola living in transition`\His (ex)-girlfriend may or may not have cheated on him with some rapper and then attempted suicide`\Clutch bear is the worst mascot in the league.`\Man when Drose went down I had flashbacks of 2012`\I actually feel bad for rocket fans. Some good friends are Houston fans and they went through the hurt of tmac and Yao and now Dwight and harden. That's rough.


Looks like it might be a complete rebuild this offseason as well.`\Stephanie Ready. She's great`\Thats some fucking bullshit`\BEV!!!`\GG Jazz`\Anthony Treyvis`\LOL

Mike with the "no pun intended" on Tommy's "Beasley was a very high draft choice". `\I just don't know why the Rockets play so badly. On paper, with their players, they should be like a top 5 team`\Cool nod to the Saturn V rocket.`\GET THE BRICKS!!!`\Not like y'all get anywhere in the playoffs anyway lol, stay salty my friend.
I'll be waiting for your "At least we're in the playoffs this year" response in a couple of minutes.  :)`\Guess we'll have to settle for bringing in the original in free agency.`\He's saying the head snap is a flop, but everyone in the league does that too`\I like our chances`\holy `\FUCK THE CAVS`\can you guys sense the lead being blown?`\That must be why then, cause based off this game and his reputation he is.

Pretty good 3 pt shoter

Good defender

Good facilitator `\who's this lady announcer that charlotte has? She sounds like she knows more shit about basketball than 99% of announcers in the nba
`\TRE-J!`\Oh come on, the games are always fun!`\Strange to run half court traps on a team with virtually no players that play iso ball. `\We need to give him more minutes.`\I agree. He always plays hard regardless, but sometimes he looks physically limited.`\I can't wait to see your mom tonight`\You know how Casey is. All or nothing.

Lowry plays 40 min or he rests the whole game and we lose`\Apparently so.`\kj needs to be on the floor to close this`\>starting Kendrick Perkins

Why even live`\Haha, idk. I'm hoping for Cavs.`\Holy Ghost goes to bed at midnight he has a little less than an hour left`\Is there a backstory?`\Wolves need to give a max contract to whoever the best rebounder in free agency is come July.`\I never hear her`\Our 2nd half struggles are alarming. It happens every damn game `\Trey, will you be the surrogate for my baby?`\God this rockets circle jerk is unbelievable. Harden definitely did not deserve the mvp over curry. `\well, at least the kings are up 9 on the mavs...`\Why didn't they get a shot off if thats the case?`\*sigh*


GG rockets....`\Thats optimistic really`\You're splitting hairs between "possible explanation" and "excuse" but fair enough, point taken.`\EARLLY basketballll!`\an armless droid will never be a consistent 3pt shooter. no thanks.`\That's the best play I've ever seen Payne make. `\Dwight looking good `\Dwight gets fouls against him for the softest shit.`\pls never watch a hornets game again`\He being Harden himself?`\Who could not root for the jazz this game, c'mon.`\and favors gets fouled on the dunk, no call`\Or just comment 100 more times in a row`\These jerseys are awful! I keep thinking the ref is playing for the rockets.`\Eh he's just a big homer. Spent the vast majority of his career in Atlanta and works in the front office as well. He's gotten better this year than in the past but it's definitely something he needs to work on. I mean I think it's fine for a home team announcer to be a homer but Nique goes above and beyond.`\Have fun in the playoffs LOL`\Think he's referring to all those leads we've beeen giving up all  year.

Obviously the overall numbers look good since raps are one of the best teams. Still concerning the way they let the opposing teams back in games`\It would nice but Pau apparently prefers the big cities for their arts scene. I could see him going to the Warriors though or ... lol the Clippers.`\This better not fucking happen again...`\Watch yourself. Everybody loves Jingling Joe.`\why are those bucks fans wearing dicks on their heads?`\Lets get him an assistant to follow him around and throw a ball at him at random times and make him catch it`\Didn't matter at all. Being down by 6 points or 7 points with 8 seconds left is the same thing.

Plus you can't say it's horrible when you don't even know what was said`\ONE Job! You had ONE JOB!`\Attaboy`\love when dwight actually gets position and we actually get him the ball`\Remember when Rockets fans were happy to get Josh Smith`\was doing his best harden impression `\New account for 22days No surprise Warrior bandwagon fan. Nice generalization about Rap fans in your short time here at r/nba.`\DMO was holding Millsaps arms wtf.`\JO3333`\He's been on a tear for at least a month. He goes cold sometimes, but I love that guy.`\Thanks my dude, didnt even realize `\tr3y bien`\Good game.

Charlotte is peaking right in time for the playoffs.`\They wouldnt even needed hardens 27 if fucking DH could hit a free throw.`\I'm here for SLAM DEKKER`\YOU CANT LET HIM KNOW YOU KNOW OR ELSE HELL HUNT YOU DOWN! DELETE THIS COMMENT NOW!`\Did favors date the referees daughter or something?  They hate him`\i didnt know anderson was allowed to push him in the back with 2 hands like that. he canned the shot but come on`\We'll get Dallas back on Wednesday.`\Not sure why d-mo isn't getting more minutes. Seems like we could use someone who can shoot from inside the 3 pt line`\Effort or no, he's still a bad defender. And his chucking tendencies have already lost the thunder a couple games this season. It's definitely close but I like harden over Brodie `\he's legit on a hot streak`\Honestly, Good for Beasley.`\Keep doing that `\fuck, you know that scene in Blazing Saddles where Mongo just knocks the fuck out of a horse? I really want to do that to a zebra right about now...`\That lineup to start the 4th? Lol what was that.`\GG Bulls`\rod purposely held back to not get whistled. Got whistled anyway. Dude was straight up gtfo`\17 shots when get doubled and tripled ?`\Although PatPat didn't sink that, i've been liking what he's doing recently`\I think they would die `\I hope so too c:`\Very fun fact `\? Mine says 60-57`\Even if the Jazz bring it back, and they do a L2M report, it still won't show how much they fucked Utah for the entire game.

Only 9 free throw attempts so far?  It's bullshit.  We should have at least 10 extra attempts from the line the way this game has been called.

`\I did sports radio my freshman year at a school near Pittsburgh. They were surprised that we don't give a shit about Pittsburgh sports teams except the penguins- but thats only because we're in the same division. But I was surprised at how much they hated the Eagles and Phillies.

So there is a rivalry, but for the most part it's one sided`\You can't combine +/- stats. It doesn't make any sense. `\DMO FOR WHAT?!`\Rockets are 2-4 on leap days`\Brew is crazy with the buzzer beaters`\Bill Simmons keeps saying it but I agree. It is borderline criminal what the Cavs have done to Kevin Love. The guy is a phenomenal post player and tonight he takes 11 shots (7 of which are 3's) and he only shoots at a 34% clip...why? I'll never understand... `\Hardaway with the Jamal Crawford Special.`\Alrighty, didn't know Tonya Harding is a Raps fan.`\Heat `\Awesome job Utah. Rooting for yall to take that 8th spot and stay there because Fuck Dallas.`\why do refs hate favors?`\Jesus Christ Joakim Noah, pretend to look human`\Jesus can the game just end, or at least no commercial breaks`\Alvin Gentry looked pissed the entire night...`\That is so dank I can't even fathom how I'm going to live the rest of my life after being so stoned from reading it. `\The most accurate comment on all of Houston sports I've read.`\Its Buck hunting season!`\True.`\I feel you and I don't understand it... I feel like with a little guy, it should be pretty distinguishable whether or not the foul needs to be called right? `\Nothing of value was lost`\Kyrie just doesn't make his teammates better. He'll never be a top player if he doesn't improve in that aspect `\Lmao what happened to that Rockets shit talk. `\Thank god that didn't happen.`\YEEEEEEEEEEEEES`\i did watch the game.. so what if he shot well initially. if we only judged players based on their first half performance, then i wouldnt even bring this up. the cavs dug themselves into a hole and he was forced to take tough shots, but it's also his fault for not doing anything when houston was catching up.

also, hes getting paid the third most on this team, behind lebron and love. i dont think its unfair to expect players like him and love to step up and not lose a 20 point lead, especially when they both are getting paid 39 million this year. `\I'm just shocked someone in Texas knows how to read`\But Monroe barely gets touched and goes to the line`\Flagrant? `\Thing is, this team isn't as bad as the record shows. I don't follow Wolves a lot and I don't expect you to follow us, but if you're saying you're surprised we're playing around .500 and should be lower, you're either dumb, a hater or just salty. Choose one.`\Y'all really think that was a flop? He got hit in the face...`\Kawhi is absolutely not 90% the player harden is on offense. Harden is a way better passer and playmaker, ball handler, driver, finisher, and has a much greater ability to draw contact. He's pretty much single handedly carrying the rockets to a top 10 offense this season. `\Very bold playing ET lol. Isaiah is great for fantasy though.`\Gordon just hurt his finger again. Are you fucking kidding me?`\Noel takes terrible shots.`\Jarrell is actually pretty good. The only good thing to come out of all of these injuries is that he gets some playing time. I wish Adams could get some playing time but y'know...he's injured.`\get josh out of the game`\MICHAEL BEASLY STIRRING THE POT`\19 shots in 15 minutes. Beastly!`\People shit on Leo, one of the announcers, but he knows basketball. And is also very important to basketball in Canada. `\Now Breen is saying "Huh Rell" thats bothering me.`\Lol he had 10 FGAs 7 ASTs, what hero ball? `\Hopefully they don't get reamed by the refs throughout the game this badly then.

This is the first time we've really seen DeMar lose his head like that though. He definitely lobbies the refs a lot like most stars do. But he's never been a flopper and usually plays through it.`\Game of runs`\Time for the TNT B crew to clown on Dwight Howard again`\Giannis is a legit 7'0 PG`\[Ahh yes, keep turning the ball over Harden!](https://public.tableau.com/profile/brent.oberlin#!/vizhome/HardenTurnovers/Dashboard1)`\The only real work I do is just copy pasting what the script plops out.

Please? `\Down 20, we have them exactly where we want them `\jabari "tony" parker`\That dude must be a homer, definite foul`\I want you to know you are most of the reason I come to the rockets post game threads anymore.

You need to know in good faith that a team will show up and play regardless.  Fans would likely get their money back as well. `\I don't care if we're winning, JB is still a fucking awful coach for leaving D-Mo on the bench this long.`\that's what the warriors are made of... steph, dray, klay, and a bunch of role players.

every team is filled with role players. the cavs are lucky enough to have kyrie and love, on top of lebron. most teams don't even have that 1 guy that can carry a team to a win consistently. this team is loaded with talent and potential, and yet, they're a disappointment.

i'll agree with your statement that the role players lost the game if kyrie and love played their brains out and still lost, but they didn't. ya, it was cool to see kyrie get 8 assists, but he shot terribly. it was cool to see love get 11 rebounds, but he shot horribly too. they have to take more responsibility, not depend on the role players, especially when the game gets close at the end. i really love delly (one of my favorites in the nba), but there is no reason why he should be facilitating when houston closes a 20 point lead and have a lead themnselves. kyrie or love should have demanded the ball and done something`\let em sleep, we gotta sign him again next summer (as in the summer after this summer)`\Feels like the first time I've heard arizas name today`\This is like the greatest ad campaign ever (samsung)`\aye`\Ingles and Johnson with the all 0's statline and -9 and -7 respectively

Dude has that same touch in the paint.`\I concur. `\PATRICK BEVERLEY IS MY SPIRIT ANIMAL`\at this point (injuries), all 35 of these motherfuckers have been tough. i think our lads can fight for a handful more of these Ws.`\are there different rules in China that the Beas is used to? /s`\yeah can't lie, you've been called up on absolutely everything this game. It sticks out cause we're losing every first quarter`\22/4/4 through 3 quarters for G.`\Can we have some of your offense? We'll take shump for ya ;)`\Jazz bench showed up`\You are playing the D-League All Stars, I'm not that surprised.`\Nah, keep dmo. He hasn't been doing as well as he did last season, but to be fair, he just came off a big injury. Dmo can do work in the paint and hit the 3!!! And besides Harden (and now Beasley), he's the only other player who can create his own shot. But I agree with letting Dwight and Tjones go. We have enough pf already with Harrell and Dekker on the come up and Dwight is getting old and can't depend on his athleticism anymore.`\Umm, that's absolutely true.  What the fuck are you talking about?  You clearly have no idea of the situation or how the cap works.  They were over the cap, therefore the only people they could sign were players they already had the rights to, like TT, or sign someone at the league minimum.

It's not that hard to understand and this is a fact.  There is no debate here you jackass. `\Beas never got the josh smith talk about backing up a step and taking a three instead of a long two `\AND he got a rebound! `\Houstons shooting is 20% higher than Jazz ... cmon bros dont you want the playoffs.`\Makes me realize how good and important  Mario was.
And I kinda feel sorry for Barnes`\That would be Sir Thomas Heinsohn.`\Didn't want to get dunked on by a midget.`\he has had a great game besides those last 2 turnovers. those first two wiggins possessions resulted in a successful pick and roll with Karl and a layup. he has to learn in game`\It's not just a river in Africa.`\Flagrant 7! Unnecessary being Dwight Howard!`\I love Beasley`\Why is Butler holding cjs arm`\Anybody else notice an absurd amount of times Derozan drove to paint, drew Valanciunas' defender, and looked Val off?

Stop the hero ball man.`\Would you say......... you owe everyone a dollar?`\Would it help if i made you hate me more? Tayshon block on Reggie?`\dmo cooking early. daddy like.`\Doing an excellent job of staying straight up and not fouling Harden.  Really happy to see that.`\He*`\Harden is a freight train`\I hate this team. Blow it up, keep Jrue and AD, and start over. `\Honestly, I would've thought there was something wrong if we *won* in Utah. At this point the Jazz have to just chalk us up as win when they see us on the schedule. `\The version I read was around 80-90 pages. `\I REALLY wish Sampson would have stuck around one more year, he coulda slid in that HC spot for sure. `\Some updates just make you happier than others. `\Who what?`\"Ha-rell"`\We switching now boys. Switch on everything`\WHO IS YOUR STEP-DADDY, AND WHAT DOES HE DO?`\The fouls were pretty equal both ways, I don't know what everyone is bitching about`\Aw man Giannis looks so happy about that triple double.  Bayless is the shit `\see yall in june cavs`\Cavs always loses to fucking Jazz...

Turns out he caught an elbow from Jerebko:

Boy did Jonas feel it tonight.  Highlights from the game:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1W1C-ov3U4`\That was beginning of the season, but in the last 7-8 games we have had terrific defence. `\I liked the "ughhh".`\I'm using NBA.com's game tracker for the first time in a while and it's better than anything else I've used so far. It has like a lineup grader that combines the plus minus's of the 5 players on the courts for both teams. Jazz lineup on right now is +35, Pelicans is -28.`\The refs have been good tonight.`\Are off the backboard lobs a regular thing now? I like it `\The clock operator is blowing this game`\92.`\I'd personally say yes but I can see how people would argue him down to 6/7/8`\Phew. Those back to back 3 point plays were big. Philly was fucking loud`\He averages 10.7 FTA this season and we held him to 7, and more importantly his first FTA was with a little over 4 minutes left in the 2nd quarter, at which point he was 0-6 from the field.`\Lol. Its our lineups they are so shit `\Yeah, 16 games I think?`\Shit. Saw the other guy in here confuse our and are. Mine is worse. Leaving it`\Isaiah Thomas just outplayed Lillard, Kyrie, Wall and then played Harden even.

Just saying.`\You guys don't have McDonald's, BK, or Taco Bell over there? :P`\"Raptors lead by a count of.....

*mental math begins*

.......11"`\I wanted rockets to lose pretty bad. Raps are 3 games behind and with Lowry being hurt a bit (assume he is gonna rest a few games), I think the 2nd seed is where Raps will stay`\> And you're acting like the cavs were playing to their potential.

They overachieved. Period. You must be a fanboy.

> They were beat by a cavs team without two top 25 players in the league. Don't make excuses.

Aren't you the one making excuses though? Yeah they lost those 2 games then proceeded to blow them out the following 3 games.`\2nd half maybe. Rockets don't really like ISO Harden in the first half. He usually focuses on getting them assists.`\Jackson was saying that's disrespectful and SVG should apologize. Honestly I say 50/50 but if Toronto has home court they deserve the odds right there`\and 4 out 5 times in the playoffs last year`\Yeah when you add it afterwards.`\\#FREESMOOVE`\Except further than you've been in 12 years lmao`\they wouldn't have if his shoes gripped better.`\Lmao. Ricky "John Madden" Rubio

Rubio: "When the shots start going in, we start coming back."`\bbq chicken`\we do, CP screaming "AYYYYY" under the basket when nobody touched em. ref didnt go for it.`\Is everyone in a metro PCs commercial half ugly?`\You were down 18 when the third started so, you're doing good.`\Wellll.. that's enough watching for me. `\Because Jones is worse and DMo is still easing back from injury. `\Because why the fk not`\San Antonio? Eh, you could use the exercise. ^^;)`\He's got half of our threes! Can't leave a sharpshooter like that on the bench.`\BEAS!`\perk needs to layoff the fucking big macs son`\Been a pretty fun and competitive game to watch so far `\HUE HUE HUE HUE HUE HUE HUE`\Well it did sound pretentious. But hey, you can do that when the warriors are playing this well.`\Houston is actually hustling on D now.`\Jason 'Ndamukong 'Vontaze Burfict' Suh' Terry
`\Turner is such a little B****`\Good game. A little weird at the end.

Harden lengthening his lead for minutes/game.`\We're 10-3 against the Mavs over the last 2 years. Respect your superiors.`\I guess we're rusty or something?`\He interviewed for the Pels job last year tho`\At least we didn't lose by 50.`\Do the Rockets ever try on defense?`\57 combined blocks for Favs/Gobert this month, Christ on skates that's unreal!`\Who is this terrible announcer and why does he love mid range jump shots so much?`\Get on that circlejerk, those upvotes are sweet aren't they `\Obviously not, because Curry didn't win the MVP unanimously.  Harden still got some first place votes (as did some other players) so there were people out there that preferred him over Curry.  In the end, Curry won it and I have no problems with it but I, entitled to my own opinion, thought Harden should have won it.

You sound like the salty one here, and I have no clue why.  I didn't say anything other than my opinion. I even acknowledge that Curry deserved the MVP but you're trying to spin it to sound like Harden was the clear cut winner and him not winning is an unseen crime against humanity.  `\I feel you man. At least we didn't have any hopes or expectations with Corbin. Though, I prefer it this way.`\what happened?`\"Man down man down"?`\No, I have forgotten last game. This result shows me that the sky is falling and we will be lucky to make the Conference Semis. This is the correct reaction, no?`\I loved it lmao`\ITS A PLAYON.. wow soft refs`\Damn what a steal Rocket fans. I guess 'Beastly' is your Whiteside, glad he finally got it together even if it's wasn't with the Heat.`\We are so ~~bad~~ good`\LeRest`\And1`\Cleveland without LeBron is just... painful to watch.`\always have faith in the 2nd half (or 4th quarter) rockets`\Good assessment. I appreciate the insight.`\BDFL`\Yea you needs to go `\Yo our kit looks like it has lil skulls on the shorts. Kinda cool, even though the whole kit looks ugly as shit.`\MAKE IT TREZ TIME, EVERY TIME`\Shut the hell up, it's not about making a point, dude, it's boring as fuck to watch and you know it. I didn't say shit about a rule change, I said I can't stand it.`\HYPE TRAAAAAAAAAAAAAIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIINNNNNNNNNNNNNN`\Rockets are repeatedly attacking JV with flawless results. Raps need him off the floor.`\Bayless also hit back to back 3's, it all happened pretty quickly haha. `\Evidently! That's what worries me. The team fighting for the 8 seed in the West is just good enough to beat the Cavs without Lebron.`\That's the great thing about being in the East. None of the supposed top seeds are great or have playoff experience save for the Cavs, and I could definitely see the Bulls give the Raptors or Celtics a run for their money in the playoffs`\Y Bev. Y. `\Rubio with the most points :)`\Big Clint changing the course of the game late - I love it.`\is jb retarded? the team is clearly tired, take them out`\Eric Collins talking like we actually want Spencer Hawes back.`\We could use A LOT of Hayward. This is so weak man. Every game right now is a must win against these below 500 teams. Gordon is our best player and is laying an egg.`\Wow what a blown lead. Rockets really don't wanna go to the playoffs. `\was a questionable shove arm thing to a guy in the air`\L for MIN gg tho. Good shit Rockets down the stretch Harden way too much of a load for em`\Rough game for Harden. Very rough game.`\im not worried`\Didn't the NBA just come out and say if you jump on a player during free throw it is a flagrant?!`\Kyrie about to do this one for Kehlani. `\Harden in facilitator mode`\Just Conger, we've still got Jake.`\nope just rockets being rockets.

we've lost to the knicks without Melo

Warriors without Curry

Clippers twice without blake

`\but he doesn't....he struggles with double teams.`\Faves is the neighbor that waters your plants when you are out of town.  `\Serious question Raptors fans, how do Lowry and DeRozan combine for only 19 shots against Harden and the Rockets?`\Listen, I'm not necessarily disagreeing with you, but this game definitely isn't a good one to use as any sort of help for your case. In a vacuum, I absolutely agree he's not worth his salary, but the Cavs' cap situation wouldn't be any different had Tristan signed with another team. The only difference is that Dan Gilbert has to pay more money, which doesn't affect the Cavs on the court at all. Unless you genuinely think the Cavs wouldn't be worse with Tristan not on the roster then you can't say it was stupid to sign him to that deal.`\he was horrendous last game, pretty much quit on the team in the 2nd quarter`\Ariza had a wide open lob to Dwight right there`\Oh Hood, that was a nice looking shot too....gotta sink those man!`\Back from a Uni test, don't even care how I scored because I was missing this game.`\JJ breaking the 3s record tonight!`\ARE YOU FUCKING KIDDING ME?

we deserve every shitty thing that happens to us`\Wiggins choking big time down the stretch. `\Same. Shoot it! Two bad shots but hes an ultimate heat check type of player. `\Harden is better than Leonard, and I would argue that he's better than Westbrook as well.`\Well if you were ever in doubt as to why all of /r/NBA hates Rockets fans, I think you now know why. Showing their true colours right now.`\I'm with you. Listening to Hubie call Jazz games during our playoff runs with D-Will turned us all off to him. He's never been pro Jazz, it's weird that he was tonight. `\Lol`\Oh, that's "toyotathon, toyotathon, toyotathon rocks" girl!`\I think it was during the Chicago game during the first half he was arguing with Dwight about where he should be on offense I think and just ignoring what Dwight was saying on at least two possessions`\Ty Clippers`\I miss LeBron on the heat. Straight villainous `\you broadcast team was roasting him. he was getting owned by IT though. but still they were vicious.`\Does it not respond if there is more than one 'should of' in a thread chain?`\I'd say it is only because he went out of his way to do that to Neto.`\YOU MEAN THE PLAYER THE CELTICS WANTED FOR 5 FIRST ROUNDERS INCLUDING THE COVETED BROOKLYN PICK? OK BRO`\Where is the Prince of Threes when I need him`\this joke was nothing`\He is kinda already old though because of his transfer. He had to go last year.`\THAT PF THAT THREW THAT PASS WASN'T ALLOWED ON THE FLOOR IN THR 4TH QUARTER LAST NIGHT. `\The probability of event B occurring given that event A never occurs, is obviously zero`\Working for yourself has its perks!`\of course they're looking for flagrant`\And book could've made it 16-0 too damnit.`\Harden popped one off in his eye`\Yes`\Calm down, we're all going to make it when Memphis falls out.`\Agreed!

What was that circus shot`\Lol, Howard feeding Harden in the post.`\RIP spacing `\^ subtly implies racist implications`\wow`\What a basket from Grizzilla tho`\> he doesn't drop at least thirty he is essentially a net negative

bit of an exaggeration imo`\Isn't there something against cruel and unusual punishment.`\HOLY FUCK HARDEN JUST LOCKED UP KYRIE`\I hope my feelings are wrong and this doesn't become a blowout. `\DMO IS GOAT`\Baffling trez doesnt get mins`\man schroeder is shredding apart the rockets`\Jesus Christ. I could score on this Raptors defense.`\i'm so ready for this season to be over... i'll take a draft pick thx`\but this is not his prime yet`\dont hesitate trey`\This is why no one likes the rockets`\Yes, he did the same in our closeout game again Boston in last playoffs.`\I won't kick you rockets fans any harder while you're down. But you might wanna start paying attention to some mock drafts and figure out how you're going to rebuild lol. `\Kj can have my children`\Can't wait to lol in first round .`\Skwah defense so dirty `\How's Beasley looked?`\that last 3 disappointed me greatly`\It was still a close game at the time. With as hot as KAT was I was hoping they would run the offense through him or maybe Lavine. `\I mean the rockets won, and hacking dwight probably got your already depleted roster in foul trouble. `\Damn IT!`\Haven't seen him do that in a while so today could be a good day to do it `\Ice Age: The Meltdown`\Duke to Duke`\At Portland when James went off`\Lets go Portland bby`\lol you know that's never happening`\\#BeardStrength`\It looked like he said: "that's the second time he's done that"`\it's only because I was cheering for u guys on both of those wins`\It's unhealthy how much I love Thabo.`\Houston fan taunts a Portland fan about getting knocked out in the first round...`\Maybe if they were playing on an 8-foot rim.`\Nikos surprisingly back too, hope he's not rushing it `\A really great 2nd qt`\Smh`\Go clippers!`\24/8/8/7/0

this scrub doesnt even have a triple double`\This is absurd.`\Gotta give props to the Grizz.

They've faced adversity this season and are still rolling. `\Beasly just fell from that twice lol`\Out of all the players on the court, he's been the least concern. Team needs perimeter defense obviously.`\Why the fuck is Payne playing? He litterally doesnt know where he should be or doing. `\Up 11 with 8 and change left`\> [half](http://i.imgur.com/3eqYwgY.jpg)`\I assume the only ones that stay are born there.`\DMooooooooo`\Same as it ever was.`\Noooo Beas!`\definitely, his eurostep is ridiculous too`\Catch ya'll another time. Gg Jazz!`\No thanks man!`\The ice has been applied.`\OH that was cold. `\For fucks sake this is frustrating hahahah`\It's amazing. People bitch if Lebron rests at an AWAY game awhile back, saying he was doing a disservice to fans who didn't live in Cleveland who have fewer chances to watch him play. Now people want to bitch about him resting at home games.`\JABAIR ON FIRE, KILLS THEM!`\YO, COREY. WHERE YOU BEEN ALL YEAR?`\The timing is clear.

Why not rest him on the road against the Nets or Knicks?

Why a NATIONAL TV game at HOME?

They wanted to give Kyrie an opportunity to have a big game.`\One day...`\Holy shit I love you Solo`\Non-mobile links:

Also, can Troy please get some more of Lambs minutes?`\Vince has been a Jazz killer his whole career. I should hate him, but I just can't.`\Lol how sad`\Nope.

What's Conley's recovery time? `\No goddamn way. Have you seen some comment threads in defaults?  Lowest. Common. Denominator.  That's not saying we on NBA are smart, but I feel like anyone who goes to a specific sub at least knows what they're doing.`\It was good in the first half, salt picked up in the second`\ha`\whaaaaaaat?!`\I would be happy to be at 500`\The young bucks are ballin tonight`\Hood is killing my soul right now`\yeah, (idk if this is the best word) but his bitterness was really offputting throughout the game`\TRE-J`\I don't know what Mitchell was thinking, having Wiggins handle the ball that much in the 4th. And when it was already too late, he finally started having Zach fed and he gets 6, how stupid can our coach get? Not to mention KAT barely played, maybe even didn't play, in the 2nd quarter.

Good game Houston, we fought hard but in the end Patrick Beverly backed up his talk. Enjoy the 7th seed, Fuck the Clippers.`\Dude`\Holy Moley`\Like, I'm not even mad at the Jazz this game.  This was all on the officiating to me.

It's so hard being a small market team. `\You didn't hear that hating on the Cavs is cool now?`\I like Cojo/Lowry backcourt down the stretch after DD got ejected, but after Lowry followed suit, there wasn't much of a choice in the matter. Neither of CoJo and JJ stood out to me this game, but I will admit that JJ did his JJ thing and got the standard work in. It was a team defensive failure in not being able to close out on shooters in the 4th and Pat Beverley all game.`\My friend this is tanking to perfection. Don't you think otherwise.`\<3`\I think you mean Rodney Hood instead of Caboclo.`\I drove four hours on Saturday to witness the Jazz lose to the Brooklyn fuckin' Nets, so I really need a win tonight.`\triggered`\Yeah, lets hope he gets angry and does them on assists !`\Yup.

he's just not often engaged`\Huge, like sizewise.`\Psh, the trainer just hides it in the towel when he comes out/time out.`\What a wild year`\Agreed. Then again, your defense was really impressive `\1 minute to go, down 7. You have the opportunity to run a play after a timeout. Instead, Cavs go to Lebron a 29% three point shooter who bricks a low percentage step back three. Low-percentage play  `\Well that trade got them Harden too.`\WHY DO THOSE SHOTS ALWAYS GO IN`\UNLEASH THE BEAS`\merde`\AHAHA THAT BROWN GUY SLAPPING LOWRY'S ASS`\GEEGEE

If it mattered I have to imagine refs would have overturned that.`\Personally, I like what he adds to our team.  It's times like this when we need another guy who can aggressive on offense. `\Harden doesn't complain to the refs lol`\I thought Dwight was known for his defense...why is the paint wide the fuck open?`\Smth Smth spirit animal smth `\KAY JAY!`\On behalf of the Utah Jazz and Minnesota Timberwolves organizations, I would like to apologize to the NBA and basketball fans everywhere for that half of 'basketball.

Thought it was all about matchup?

Why not JJ for DD after the Tech, they close in style and would be in our favour with the assists. `\Ahh aight, well ignore the 1st quarter ok?`\Not this year lol. Dude ain't that good.`\corey brewer, dpoy`\Nice class`\Because half of that team is half ex rockets `\our announcers are great if you can accept the blatant bias. they're really energetic. `\Our defense has been faltering over the past month and it's been hidden in wins.

What a moron.`\Kyrie stepping up in the facilitator role in the absence of Lebron with 8 assists`\looked like a two, it looked like his foot was on the line`\He was also on the verge of a triple double while shooting under 33%, would have been a weird one if he got it.`\Actually both of them irritate me too.

Harden basically plays like a pure pg - he brings the ball up and sets the whole offense up.

I remember hearing about his pet goat.

Yea guess Ariza just isn't consistent but he's a great player. 3+D guys are perfect complimentary players next to stars. `\Crawford'd tmac'd`\WHAT THE FUCK KEMBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
`\Harden is a great 3 and D player. Shoots 3's and goes down!`\fuck lue`\Take away the point, he jumped way early`\This and the @ Denver game are 50-50 games according to my Computer model`\They're letting *a lot* go down low.

As for the headlock, I'm pretty sure if Shabazz made a bigger fuss about it, they would've called the tech.`\Z`\That last game of the season is looking more and more intriguing, `\Those Rockets jerseys are ugly.`\Whatever, Houston.  I'll take my 25% chance at #1 overall and you can take your first round sweep.  Enjoy!`\I loved Mack. I wish he could've had a significant role in the rotation. He had a game last year where he went 7/7 from three to bring us back against Cleveland in an otherwise blowout loss. Ended up winning that game. `\¯\\_(ツ)_/¯ Who says no?
`\ARRRIIIIZZZAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA`\That was a blocking call almost.  `\Anytime I get tickets I'll give them to you. Past two season I've gone to 4 games, lost all 4`\Fuck it. Start tanking. `\Damn... Wonder what would happen if Harden and Lowry could play on the same team together... Guess we'll never know`\we pay him for his offense and rebounding not his defense.

He just had his arms up lol!`\Honestly if Lin can consistently be a bench threat scorer and actually shoot with confidence you guys will be a serious threat to almost any team. Kemba has been godlike this stretch, but there will be games where just can't it going and having a bench scorer who can heavily impact the game is huge. `\glad dmo is actually getting minutes. we need him at full strength if we want any hope for the playoffs.`\ Bebe crafty as hell. `\Damn what a boneheaded play to foul Hayward there. `\Tonight isn't an effort problem. They're just hitting everything.`\I believe it's 10-1`\if we weren't having the worst 3pt shooting night in the history of the morey era this would be a blowout. it's unreal how much the basketball gods hate us this year.`\Thank you !`\why can't we ever enjoy a blowout`\NBA wise, it's probably 1a. Curry   1b. Towns`\yea, his energy level was the only thing that kinda slowed down. Only super noticeable thing that was affected by the rookie wall.`\Of course Harden`\Depending on what was said, maybe the Lowry ejection.`\Same logic: "I find it hard to believe that GSW would beat LAL in a seven game series." `\Can we please just let Harden flip his damn head back?!`\I got 2 girls and they get a along T-Ross. 6Man like T-Boss`\Josh Smith gave us scoreboard eternal we don't have much let us take this`\trevor ariza is the GOAT scrambled plays`\?`\I really like Capela's game.

I haven't been watching the whole game, so I don't know if the refs have been bad or whatever, but that seemed like a correct no-call.`\I know these stats are pretty meaningless when you qualify them using the player's exact stat line and above, but it's only the 10th game of 40/14/5 or above since 1983 and 14th such if you remove the pretty meaningless 5 rebounds.

^^^\(and ^^^really ^^^not ^^^that ^^^it ^^^matters ^^^but ^^^3rd ^^^game ^^^including ^^^1 ^^^or ^^^less ^^^turnovers)`\I'd rather watch paint dry than watch this game. Just get Beasley in and let him do what he wants`\Nice work. Just some chest-beating clarification: Troy had a key steal and a nice OReb that really helped keep the Hornets' flow going. He did also convert a Kemba assist.`\someone feed Corry brewer a damn burger `\Washed up Dwight`\Yep, I 100 percent have no clue whats going to happen in a Rockets game.
My reaction is mostly laughter after seeing a loss after a lead. "Lose to Utah? After that margin?" "Well if you don't like that, you don't like Rockets basketball!." I just expect anything can happen with the Rockets.
I mean watch us beat the Cavs then lose to the constantly crippled Bulls.`\well how late do you play the spurs? could get a win vs. a spurs team that is resting. Jazz and Pistons seem like winnable games. `\You wouldn't believe how common it is for people to come in and ask for that kinda stuff. I still can't help but just shake my head. `\Fuck man,  we're really gunna lose this game `\^^we ^^might ^^win`\every. single. tv. break.`\WE DON"T HAVE A BIG THREE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! A big three consists of three All-Star caliber players, you think Ross will become an All-Star? Until he does we have a big two, :P`\Ariza is just cold, Brewer's goat died and he's been in mourning ever since. `\Yup. `\They could probably still score 80 against Atlanta though. `\Meanwhile, over on Clutchfans, she's "stupid," "retarded," and "a bitch."

Stay classy CF forums!`\NASA > NASCAR. `\I actually like bun b more than drake believe it or not I was just making a dumb joke`\No kidding. Hopefully Fister can have a great bounce-back year.`\*career high`\"Come on now, you can't leave Riddick open. He shoots 47% from behind the arc. Mainly because he is 6' 4 and 190 lbs.

If you know he is your transcendent player, then put the ball in his hands and let him get into a rhythm. His usage rate is still high, but sometimes in games like these, it just seems bonkers to me that he doesnt have more opportunities. Every other star in the NBA is given more opportunities to flourish on offense than AD.

Maybe there is a reason he has shown such little effort this year. Maybe its because the front office fired Monty Williams then gave the offense to a coach that allows the wings to hold almost every single play hostage to their shot happy whims? You can blame AD on his effort and it would be valid, but you cannot put it solely on him. At times he is playing with D league players or shot happy guards that refuse to pass to him.

* Blatt: .732
* Lue: .680
`\Batum with 5 assists in the first 5 min`\Kyrie has been posting photos on IG since late last year of him with this girl Kehlani with captions indicating they are in a relationship, the most recent being a couple of weeks ago.

Then yesterday this rapper partynextdoor posted a photo of him with kehlani in bed, presumably after a night filled with raucous love making. Nobody is sure if its an old photo seeing as PND use to date Kehlani or they got back together or if her and Kyrie had already broken up or he got cheated on.`\That raptor fan looked high af`\CoJo!!!`\What did Dwight just say to Kiera? `\Shouldn't you be winning then?`\did they just start doing it? watched a game on abc last weekend and don't remember seeing it `\not today lol`\ask and ye shall receive`\Kyrie couldn't do it alone`\Wide open misses, zero defense. Looks like the Jazz are on the road again. `\Well, if there's one thing Houston and Toronto can agree on:

FUCK THE ROYALS`\Man these refs are stupid tonight`\Check the date`\Now that's one really long comment. `\You forgot to add "/s"`\lol the wolves are going to easily come back, The stereotype about the Rockets defense is so true. We'll click`\R u ok buddy`\DO WORK, DWIGHT`\Gg Atlanta

Harden, Beasley and D-Mo had nice games. We need Dwight to be more consistent and put both sides together. `\I know Harden is the houston offense but 6 TOs in 2 quarters is not acceptable at all.`\Just call a regular foul and let the game go on. Tired of the breaks.`\They beat the Thunder and Clippers this season too.`\THIS FLAIR DON'T FADE`\I'd imagine there's a lot of things you don't realize. `\At the game as an unbiased observer with a few friends. It took over 10 min for Harden to take his first shot, is something going on I'm not privy to? He hasn't been involved with the offense at all really so far.`\I've been wanting more alternate uniforms for a while so I'm stoked for that. I love the note as well so no complaints here. `\This is a clear lapse in coaching by the Raps. It's impressive they've won so many games despite the terrible coaching. `\Let Kirk make a basket`\Please just sit Terry's ass down for rest of the game.   Dude's playing like his wife served him divorce papers earlier today. `\We still would've been down 4 with 30 seconds left, let's be real here`\Damn what a gammer by howard`\our high volume bench scorer is Al Jefferson, and he's been way better than Lin. Him coming off the bench really has been one of the keys to our success. `\dmo and dwight aren't quick enough to trap and recover, stop with the dumb traps, atlanta is too good a passing team for that to work especially when you don't trap properly`\athr33333za. fucking finally`\yeah, the movement was too animated to not be a joke.`\Hayward hesitated big time on that shot. Let him block it`\There are times when I really question it.`\Skip to my Lou!`\12 points on 50% shooting across the board and 7 assists. He's been doing well tbh`\Delly came in and offense stopped moving.`\Yeah...refs definitely missed that one.`\do rockets practise getting calls instead of defense?`\lol the fuck is this`\fuck it man, but Josh Smith in the game`\Some people from Pittsburgh care about Pitt or Duquesne basketball, but generally they're just much more into football, hockey, and baseball. You're honestly more likely to find Cavs fans than Sixers fans there (Pittsburgh is closer to Cleveland than it is to Philadelphia). `\Pat "Ray Allen" Beverly `\Funniest guy in the team. Really cool. Really good glue guy. Serviceable off the bench and above average 3 or shooter`\Nah man, Marcus is an ugly dude.

Source: I am gay.`\Yup.`\because one is coached by JBB and the other is coached by Lue?`\Playoff Lebron activated.`\0:00`\free chic-fil-a for the garden tonight`\Not this time, I guess`\I want to eat the local food in chicago so bad`\feeling this bucks crowd. real good atmosphere.`\Damn Vince....that's going to be on Shaqtin`\I'm sorry I don't normally do this but you have to know the difference between "our"and "are". You would use "our" in this scenario.`\fiambres`\Dude, does it really matter? Either team is getting swept by Golden State in the first round anyway. Y'all totally deserved the win, but I don't get why you're acting so high-and-mighty all of a sudden. Your team still has a losing record. I'm way past the point of caring about this season.`\Nah they are just hard to take seriously.


Teams full of scrubs with their 3 best players always seem to give the Cavs trouble.`\Harden just can't handle the ball today`\> Houston, you have a problem

https://media.giphy.com/media/L29fiOMSDhhvi/giphy.gif`\He is basically like the best player in the whole D-League, was great in summer league, the highest paid 2nd round pick in NBA history, and this is his first non-garbage time minutes. THe hype is bursting through the roof. He was also the NBA's PER leader before tonight at like 60`\Yeah fuck Draymond Green`\How can that foul be on Harden? Don't u have to try to play defense first to get called for foul?`\One day, one of our bigs will catch a bounce pass.`\That's Grizzilla to you`\I have never seen AD play this bad. He's like a more useless version of Asik right now. He isn't even moving on offense. Fuck man. `\I'm dressed like a true Texan for the Rodeo but my plans cancelled so I'm now sitting on my porch with a Shiner. I wonder who looks sillier tonight, Calvin or myself.

Also this is like a battle of the most homer announcers ever. I'd pay to see a Celebrity Deathmatch between Heinsohn and Worrell.

FUCK THE ROCKETSSS`\I am not convinced we have ever not ever will have a great perimeter defence. `\Hahaha Dwight reading on the Bench. `\morey needs to share the numbers with harden about his short bounce passes to bigs. they seems to fail 2/3 of the time.`\No fucking idea what we're doing.`\Let's go Hardens!`\tonight we're 33%...`\We are not bros with them are you being serious??`\Rockets seem awfully winnable in that lineup too... :D`\Those cheerleaders whew go hawks`\Gah. I hate this playoff race. I remember when basketball was fun to watch and not stressful.`\What are you even saying lol`\Just stop man. You're not funny`\How is it Houston Ball?`\This Jazz team is huge.  In the 90s would have been a 60 win team.`\BEVER3

Or maybe I wasn't paying enough attention and there was one after that. thanks!`\jesus..rockets are so bad at boxing out on offensive rebounds `\Who's a realistic top 14 pick that can compliment Harden?`\Opps, I guess your team of washed up players begs to differ. `\Late call but totally a foul`\I wish we would never get a double digit lead in a game.  Whenever that happens I know we will end up losing.

Sucks Hayward couldn't follow up his 17 point 1st quarter with anything in the 2nd.`\What a painful 4th to watch ugh `\true shit post.`\but you can switch to H&R Block and pay half price`\lol harden cmon fam`\To preempt the complaints about homers, here's a link to a stream with either rockets and celtics announcers, just select home/away under "Select Stream"

http://hehestreams.xyz/games/qma9qJk`\The kid's got moxy.`\Is this clipper announcer going to keep saying that ridiculous statement that BEASLEY is a TOP 10 scorer in the league. Guy can score, but you can name 10 without even trying.

are you fking for real dawg`\a dwight 3 to win this would be poetic justice`\He's actually shadow banned so he can see all of this!`\beggars can't be choosers, and ever since bs went down i be beggin`\40 before 20 or 20 before 40 for the Raptors today. `\Flopper Harden at it again. You'd think he practices it`\towns the best player out of everybody here tonight `\Rubio is The goddamn Maestro. `\So many blowouts today`\It was a broken play and Lebron pulled back and took the three. Hardly Lue's fault Lebron shot a 3.`\Any chance you could point the blame at your medical team? How many injury riddled seasons will you take before considering that it might not be bad luck but incompetence?`\Make em say ugh`\Kevin love `\Beasley has been absolutely awesome in a Rockets jersey.

Harden is incredible.

The ref crew was not the best.`\Quits on defense, gets all the foul calls, too many isos.. etc.`\Also, why was Howard on the floor for last 6 seconds? We had to score a three, and with him it was like playing with 4 palyers. He was wide open, nobody from Pacers team gave a shit about him and they could concentrate on covering Harden. Brewer or Bev could have taken this three point shot, miss it or not, but it would be SOMETHING`\Ouch. Rockets not ready to be counted out.`\Almost Beasley `\i'm so fucking hard right now.`\She doesn't seem to think harden works hard on defense, what a hot take`\Oh didn't know that thanks. /s

Is it usual for the team hosting the game to have a patch?`\Ugh wanna get home and watch, thread sounds interesting `\I don't mind him except he keeps saying JJ Riddick`\I soooo told you guys`\*knocks on wood*

im just kidding basketball gods. lets go jazz.`\I need some capella Howard lineup right now`\Ariza is the GOAT of 3 & D players`\You see that foul? Def a choke`\I'm starting to think /u/ThisIsAMormon is a fuckin liar because we haven't heard back. Unless he is tappin that mormon ass rn. `\The rockets had 9 players score in double digits. `\Harden, you're not Curry ffs`\Lmao Dwight was straight up and down. Good God.`\"Why don't people like the Rockets?"

lol`\kyrie like kehlani who???`\It's the second quarter.`\He's good but he gets blocked all the time. Which is why we need another one.`\Another turnover off Rudy's soft as velvet hands`\Hopefully a rhythm develops in the 2nd.`\He gets bs garbage minutes. But omg when hes in its instant production. Wed love him to get more minutes. He plays the opposite way everyone else plays D. So good D lol. `\Hate watching this team without Lowry.`\damn why has no thought of that before?`\wait i thought that was Thornton`\Ignore him, he's just a troll.`\?`\Our coach is so soft one of our assistant coaches has to do the bitching`\we all are. but this is a good position to be in. we just need to pray for 1.6 seconds.`\This one was for u/ThisIsAMormon and his hot date `\Gimme my hug`\Harden 1 rb away from a triple double!

Edit: Boom there it is!`\Motherfucking Mack`\TREZ TIME, BABY! LET'S GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!`\Agreed.`\Nah.  They've regressed pretty alarmingly on defense since Lue took over.`\El Del`\Ah so this is what happens when a D-league team plays against a real NBA team.
`\SG (sadgame)`\Because if someone can, someone else will want to, then another and then everything is fucked up`\Yes.`\is Lyles going through a hot streak or is he legit`\Fuck this gay earth.`\I can't keep the fouls I didn't use for the next game - patbev`\The Rockets continue to outdo themselves when it comes to embarrassing losses this season `\That was not a travel.`\Had a feeling they'd make a run. Get Love/Irving back in around minute 7/8 and close it out`\Man I firmly believe r/nba collectively has the lowest general human IQ in all of reddit.`\But also in the middle of a free throw is just dumb on a whole other level.`\K LOW!

Edit: Dude, stop pissing off the Officials. let it wait for the locker room, their non-working ears can't hear you in there...`\Well we evened it up after being down 11 fairly quickly. That's a good sign.`\Lamb got benched this half`\He hasn't made it yet, Nique`\damn, what starting calibre PF could we get for JVs contract?

No question. He turned down two reasonable offers from the dubs already. So now a team will offer him the max and the dubs will likely match. Most likely scenario is him staying with a max contract. `\Fuck everything. Really this team is the worst kind of bad. `\I wanna see OKC vs Houston and Trailblazer vs Warriors so im rooting for this.`\Don't care about winning or losing this game, I'm just sick of refs trying to make the game about themselves.`\From the angle they showed on Root Sports, it looked like CP3 took a swipe pretty high at him`\James Harden is a very good basketball player`\Must be frustrating for the opposing team seeing Beasley score pure buckets and there's nothing they can do.`\lol you know it's bad when even your own fan base is shunning you`\Noooo, Lance is a headcase but he definitely makes shit happen. If we could never give Hairston another minute though I'd be happy`\I think it's more likely that the Jazz will catch the Mavericks rather than Houston at this point.

* Great team job of staying up and not letting Harden get into a rhythm at the line.  He was 0-6 without a free throw attempt almost immediately.
* All 5 starters were above 60% TS.  Everything's just clicking so well right now for that unit and the other bench players are sliding in occasionally for their own good matchups.  That's a great place to be in.
* Aaron Harrison, our victory cigar, has now gotten minutes against Detroit and Houston both.
* 6 first quarter assists for the 2nd consecutive game for Nic Batum.  Only finished with 8 this time but 14/8/8/1/1 is a pretty standard Batum game about which I'm pretty happy.
* As a result of that, our last 3 first quarters:  39 points, 38 points, 34 points.
* 17-2 run to start the 4th won us the game, and over that run, all but 1 possession was either scored or assisted by Kemba.  I'm blanking on how Lin got to the line so there's a decent chance Kemba was involved in that too.
* Beasley was an absolute nightmare matchup for Kaminsky, which was surprising given how well Kaminsky handled the quicker Tobias Harris yesterday.
* Lin had his best game in months on Lin bobblehead night -- 16 points on 64% TS with solid defense on Harden at times.
* Terry had three cheap shot fouls this game and I should be angry about it.
* 1-14 from 3 combined from your 3 best players who shoot will kill you every time.  Just some unlucky shooting from Ariza/Beverley/Harden -- no other way around it.  The Back to back probably didn't help, but ultimately sometimes that just happens.
* Meaningful Troy Daniels minutes!  IDK what prompted this sudden change but it's a welcome one while Lamb continues to struggle.
* That said, I don't think reading too much into their respective +/-s is worthwhile -- Daniels happened to be on the court for the strong run but was more the beneficiary of Kemba just going nuts than anything else.
* The Rockets basically held in this game tonight by crushing us on the boards -- The Hornets shot better for most of the game, and the TOs were similar, but +5 offensive rebounds is nothing to sneeze at.  Then, of course, the 4th quarter happened.

Overall, we're now approaching the "not if in the playoffs, but where".  We're 4.5 up on the Bulls, own the tiebreaker over everyone, and the soft schedule actually gets a little bit softer now that Detroit and Houston are out of the way.  We get Dallas next, in Charlotte, having already blown them out once in Dallas.  The 3rd seed is ours for the taking and I feel pretty good about us in the playoffs with home court.`\COACH HARDEN > COACH LEBRON`\Bismack time`\I guess he has earned it.`\UNBEASLIEVABLE!!!!`\But at this pace Wiggins will eclipse Harden. Wiggins is 5 years younger.`\[Harden selling a foul](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kd_tqUJZGAs)`\Zeller is getting handled. `\I feel sorry for the team we play in the second half tonight`\Harden can never foul anybody else.

Absolutely unaware`\If were awful and we beat you guys then what does that make you're team?`\I just came`\It's levonchuck`\SOMEtimes?`\Lol, what?`\portland getting beat down, mavs choking away a big lead, could be a great night!`\:( Hayward's average is down to 19.8. Was hoping he'd crack like 25 to bring it back up. Gonna have to have a big game in one of these last 9 to average 20 on the season`\Oh come on, he was never set, thats a terrible call.`\huehuehuehue`\she just jumped in the discussion with maximum level hate`\if you're the lucky ticket holder in section 325, row h, seat 18, come on down! you've won a spot in our pf rotation! who knows how many minutes you'll get?`\That was a NASTY dunk`\Did JVG just say Toronto overachieve?

Nah I can't go that far.`\If he had a better handle it wouldn't be so easy to trap him. Why we've decided to play into their hands by having Wiggins initiate the offense behind the 3 point line a bunch of times is beyond me. `\/r/clevelandcavs is worse than this subreddit now.`\As a UCONN fan. Me too man me too `\Leslie makes this unwatchable   `\mar 5, 2016. we still suck.`\terrible coaching, low player BBIQ. `\Jazz fans: so youre saying theres a chance`\Buying players, will pay trident layers`\patrick beverly looks fuckin' terrible so far

Hayward warming up?  `\So majestic`\Weak foul`\http://i.imgur.com/1F4QL1x.gif`\Beasley has been a pretty fantastic addition to the team so far.`\wtf happened`\Damn what happened to Rose? `\At least they have a future outside of 1 guy. but on a serious note I have no idea what happened to your team.`\Howard should get the ball every possession`\Grizz don't want to make easy buckets and Jazz don't want to take advantage of that.`\Favors has a cap on the number of foul calls he's allowed to get in a game.`\One that wants KD to rejoin the Beard at Houston!`\Mr Luscher looks like hes 15 but is more badass than most people in this thread.

`\Yeah he should've tried to change the game plan to get it more in the paint but instead kept trying to open up somebody `\yup he's up there as well, reiterates Sympton16's point that there's a lot of guys that deserve to be top 5, it all depends on the year...forgot about blake since it's been a while since he played`\I commented. `\Go up by 18, Jazz take Gobert out of the game and go small with Booker at the 4 and Favors at the 5. What does JB do?

He fucking goes big with Capela at the 4 and Dwight at the 5, a lineup we haven't used in fucking months.

We're going to lose to Philly.`\*Super*cool`\Hehe`\yo cavs lets not do this`\They were playing much better this time last year. Then the injuries happened. I hope you agree he didn't have the help he needed after that.

And now they're playing like this in his absence. Hell, even when he's there they are not inspiring confidence. I'm always open to changing my opinion if they play better, but right now they are pretty bad outside of Lebron.

It's not 100% about keeping the same roster. Look at Miami's drop-off from '13 to '14. Don't tell me it was because Mike Miller was dropped!`\Howard still one of the best C's in the league `\Their first day back `\most of them do not know how to break down plays at all, Houston's announcers dont even know what sport they're calling. this lady was like "Beasely had kemba on him but Ariza made the mistake by cutting baseline which allowed Nik to stay and Kemba to follow Ariza, negating the mismatch" or whatever and I was like wowow, damn, nobody woulda been able to point that out`\Because Gianno has 13 rebounds at 7'0`\Game thread got toxic real fast towards the end... fans of both teams gotta chill out`\I feel like these last two games have been a perfect description of our season thus far.

is this litruhlly your first day on reddit`\2 mins left tied game and who's taking long 2's? Fucking shump man `\Another fun game. :)`\Why isn't he playing`\That -27 on Beasley was not his fault at all. Our defense was obviously a bit shoddy during that period but it wasn't like we just bent over or anything, they just made every shot for like 6 minutes straight. It was crazy.`\Yeah I'm good with the Hornets.`\It's true. Let the man speak `\Your team got shit on by a maybe top 15 player, if that`\I love watching Smart play.`\Jazz fans - thoughts on Ingles? Man, he really strikes me as the crackhead from college that nobody liked. `\hes a legend`\now that was some jazz defense`\Ideally it'd be the Wizards, because we have their number.`\Fine, give him the tech for talking, but that was a push. That's a tough play to get thrown out on. `\Why are we so shit in even numbered quarters?`\We were on a roll including wins in Toronto and Boston. What makes you think you would've won if we weren't tired? Our record doesn't reflect on how good we really are...consistency is our problem.

If we're playing at our best no team is safe, especially yours. `\BATTLE OF THE ISO SGS.

FIRST TO 20FTA WINS THE GAME`\If we keep up this scoring increase (factor 2.4) throughout the game we'll have scored 197 points at the end of the game. Here's the score after each quarter: 1st: 10 - 2nd: 34 - 3rd: 82 - 4th: 197. Should most likely be sustainable and be enough for the W.`\Rose is back baby`\cmon jabari 2 more points`\lmao I'm surprised they even called it a foul. really fucked up this time `\LOL Ross just Hardened on defence.`\men lie women lie ball dont`\Haha, how's Rubio doing for them? `\6.81%`\I thought we already had the collapse in the 2nd quater smh`\I know Butler got an offensive foul there, but what on earth was Dwight even doing there on that screen?`\We r fucked fam`\i miss ernie`\Lol, this will definitely be a flagrant.`\He was setting in for curry to drive. If he played up curry would blow by him for a layup. He thought a 35 footer had a better chance of missing than a layup. I think he was wrong`\Man I cant wait for alec to come back, our bench is so bad.

Edit: im dumb`\Refs need their airtime. That's embarrassing `\Damn I was hoping Sully would save the questionable shot till later. Could tell he was feeling it.`\Dwight...`\James Harden is Jerry Stackhouse 2.0 empty inefficient stats `\Lyles passing has been a thing of beauty`\Lol JB the snitch`\JVG homie`\Yes that was the joke`\People like to say that Harden isn't fun to watch but he is an offensive juggernaut.`\I like Beasley, will be rooting for him when he isn't playing us.`\woooooooooooooooooooooo`\Ariza trip dub watch 18-11-7`\I agree that was an awful call`\Kyrie about to be on suicide watch with Kehlani`\Eh kind of a boring game so far both ways`\Terrible body language on the Rockets.`\Booker energy or booker missed layups?`\Beasley's a monstrous talent.

You have the biggest clown in the game on the team, but he can play. Harden isn't easy to play with (allegedly) but neither was Kobe and the stats speak for themselves.

What happened to him`\good golly the Rockets video board is fucking huge`\He's not normally like that though, is he?`\Man Harden tries really hard but we just can't pump out a win when he has to do everything. We really need solid, not inconsistent scoring options other than Harden. I don't understand Patrick Beverley, but whatever.
GG Utah.`\STOP. THE. FUCKING.

We just clunked so many threes tonight.`\Joe Ingles is best shooter of all time `\Gorgui babyyyy`\Someone get that man a fake birth certificate!`\smoove's passing is so nice. such a different element to the team. he just needs to get the shooting touch from last year back.`\Damn it Bev :/`\Buckle up!`\I'm slacking today.

I'm not at home right now and tried to do all this from my phone. Needless to say, it didn't go nearly as smoothly as usual.`\PG only getting warmed up. like how when you fucking yo girl and you start off nice and slow and stretch that pussy out a bit, but before its over you poundin that shit into submission `\Not really, since ASB he has been shooting near league average from 3. His TS% is also pretty decent because of his absurd FTr. He is an elite PG defender, and an elite facilitator.

Our starting lineup has the highest ORTG of any lineup with more than 400 minutes iirc.`\This is my last comment, I shall spend my time shaking on the floor from now on.

You can sit down now.`\Harden does that shit all the time and they call it a foul on the defender. What the fuck`\damn good job by love to get there and get set

`\I love them doing basketball`\The weird thing about Beas is that he seems completely opposed to Moreyball but I think it works well because there should be a balance.   You can't just shoot layups and threes exclusively.  It makes you too predictable. `\Bro! Wouldn't it be funny if we score more points than them?`\Same `\Top 5 Rockets game of the year for me, if for nothing else than seeing KJ and Harrell get some minutes :)`\Rose & Buckets combining for 80 today. `\You just said you can name 10 without trying but you didn't name 10 in your original post and then fail to name 10 in this reply...

God hates memphis. lol `\Kuroko no Basket!`\Clips or OKC`\Lets find out what we're made of here`\SAVE US TERRY`\*he ��`\Nah, man. James Harden is the man, man.`\Also because his profile matches exactly what we need - rim protection and rebounds, with a hint of offense - and because he's a worker whose intensity will fit well with the team. `\It's a chalupa with cheese inside the tortilla.

We never get the better end of calls.`\Haha I had the same thought`\Yeah, saw that `\Who is the rockets next head coach? Can't be this scrub .`\Harden getting a lowlights video`\That sucks. And it was early season when McHale was booted, right? Long time to have an interim head coach. That kind of uncertainty can't be good for a team.`\I don't think he was "flopping" he just seemed like he wanted to let off some steam on the no call and the refs took notice lol`\I honestly don't know why they didn't stick to that. It was working well`\ya mama`\That said, even if he's not a shooter, he's been really impressive for the last few minutes.`\For sure but Booker is going to be special.

George hill is a great actor`\I need some beas`\I'm pretty sure a local high school team could put up 100 on us`\You guys are the last team to talk when it comes to unlikeable players.

fuck this`\lol'd`\If I was Barnes, I wouldn't leave. Even if he signs for under market value to keep winning, he would still be only 27 or 28 when he signs his new contract. If he keeps playing as he is now, he'll at least get a pretty good contract after. `\And your middle child "Mamba"`\Complete flop, awful call.

Congratulations good sir. `\We let you have Korver and Sap, you owed us! JK TYVM for the Mack Attack! `\Man, are all commentators this biased? I forget how different Blaha and Special K are.`\Harpring looks like a competent announcer next to these guys`\Jazz have had a 3 minute scoring drought and a 5 minute scoring drought.

The Timberwolves have had a 4 minute scoring drought.`\best ball movement all season`\You saw the flashbacks rushing through his head.`\Yeah, I don't think late whistles are unique to him, but they should definitely be a little more prompt about it.`\Racist AF reported `\i listened to the song though`\>being this mad

hopefully we don't get swept as a 2 seed

give the rox credit, capela blocking shots left and right`\The crowd in SLC would do the same thing.`\Considering how he's been shooting this year, he can take as many shots as he wants. `\Towns is still a beast. `\not a fan. I'll give him every benefit of every doubt though. Being on TV is tough, he'll get better`\I don't blame you for believing that. He can definitely zone out at times, but he's been giving effort on that end pretty consistently for a while now.`\I loved it. `\:)`\just turned on the game, how hard is james harden not trying on defense and did he party with drake last night?`\ye, and as a Jazz fan can't really complain he was a steal at mid 20s with how he's been playing. If he keeps improving like he has been I wouldn't be surprised if he takes over as the new #1 and GORdon slides to #2 option.  `\Gordon is a gorgeous and beautiful man.  They should make a naked statue of him in front of the Viv.  No fig leaf tho~`\Yeah but there were like 3 possessions in a row where he didn't get the ball and kind of bitched about it. One was when Dwight brought the ball over and for some reason didn't pass to Harden even tho he demanded it`\I feel like the refs like to hear the excitement of the home crowd.... unless they are in SLC where they like to hear our laminations instead...`\my stream must be late haha, i was referring to the play before that where he had the behind the back pass, i forget to who`\ok fine package deal of cj, ed davis, vonleh, and henderson`\Wow JJ `\Kevin Love was a pick setter in the 4th. He needs the ball in the post and should grab boards instead of standing by the 3 all game`\i was hoping as much`\neither side is getting calls dude chill`\After a scary one and a half quarters, I'm glad they're back`\GG`\That boy can fly`\JVG with the truth bomb about trash talking "that's good for the game"`\He collided with Biz earlier. Sorta looked like he ran into Biz's neck; there weren't that many good angles on it.`\Raptors lead the league in getting apologies from the refs. There is no other team in the nba that the refs made more bullshit calls against that they apologized for afterwards, than the raptors.`\Mack's playing way too out of control.`\I said he had 32 points so his free throw attempts were obviously greater than or equal to 32`\Has Ty Lawson been any good for the Pacers?`\Das coo. Missed that. But uhh... what you said still sounded um..

Not that there's anything wrong with that!`\he's the main issue with your team, he's got the biggest ego in the game. `\D-Mo for how many?`\No, leave it`\Spurs? Warriors?`\3 year contract. Not so easy to just dump`\Come on Utah!`\What part of they did offer him a lower contract do you not get?  He did refuse it.  I don't think the Cavs, with their win now mentality, wanted to risk not getting him.  It's not hurting their cap, only Gilberts pockets, which is fine.  He has plenty of money.

And you have the nerve to call me delusional but you think the Pistons will be Cleveland in the first round, lol.  Good one. `\HE DON'T PLAY D DOE!`\Beasley lit them up. He blazed them. He smokes marijuana`\Sad for the loss but happy for you guys cause I was perusing your subreddit and some dude posted a prayer thread before yesterday's game and everyone said AMEN and I was like "That's really sweet I hope they win their next game." Little did I know that next game was against us.

I GUESS what I am saying is...You're welcome. `\Man, our players were acting like assholes during the game. At least try to be humble. If you feel like you should start acting like an asshole and acting like the shit against a D LEAGUE TEAM when you are WINNING BY 50 POINTS, your ego must really be inflated

Im a rockets fan, but the way we acted just made me dissapointed...`\GG PELS `\eric gordon officially has re-fractured his finger.

it sucks, but i cant say im surprised. some guys bodies' just werent made for the NBA`\Oh shit guys I think the seasons over.`\GG Cavs`\I wish I was in Harry's Love nest.`\Via Ben Dowsett`\Wiggins 3 ball been getting better! `\Does anyone have worse homer announcers than Boston?

Edit: I've attracted a group of angry Bostonians. I'm sorry Bostonians don't hurt me. i love bill simmons.`\LEETTTTSSSS GOOOO`\I think he just tries to do a bit too much sometimes, but nothing stupid. Call that what you will, but I don't think that's poor BBQ. `\we're giving you no lebron. what more do you want? delly starting at the 5?`\Wow so Jazz ask for a replay under 2 minutes, nothing. Then Wolves petition a minute later, granted. Absolutely no consistency`\These refs shitting the bed in all possible ways `\I would imagine that JB wants him a bit more rested for the 4th. Also, you don't want the dude to get injured. After an injury, you don't go HAM - you risk another injury. `\Player of the game! Lol`\Naw`\Kyrie going to go off. `\Eh, the Lowry trade helped us get Harden. I'm cool with it.`\Harden's first step is too nasty`\of course`\That is *exactly* the same thing, said in exactly the same way, with exactly the same feeling. >:(

Salt is the only way for life.`\I think he was benched for matchup purposes. It worked out too. Looks like he's back in the lineup to defend Harden, and it's working out great so far.`\>bad player

FTFY`\Im right there with you bud. I was going off. (Also when we won i went nuts)`\Its Middleton bro`\John loves the game and the Bucks and Gus Johnson is always full of excitement.`\Yeah I think Raps best chance for advancing is against Pistons cause they play against them so well and like playing on the road there, not necessarily cause they're the worst team in the hunt.`\reason he was open`\During the first part of the season we could score at a decent rate, but we wouldn't play D...now we can't do either?`\just need to play some defense, make them shoot outside, we'll be fine.`\When he joins Stevens again ;)`\Coach `\Really hope jazz get in over rockets. Well done Utah `\That second part isn't necessarily true, but my problem is that Quin trusts Mack as if he's been a 10 year starter. Tonight is a prime example of that. Neto played great, but Quin is still sticking with Mack after he gave up a big run on his own. `\Wait how does Jabo have 31 minutes and only 2 rebounds at 6' 8"?`\Today's NBA Now requires sensitivity training.`\They should just line everyone up and have a free throw shootout.`\I love the way your team plays. So refreshing to see an offense so pass-savvy and balanced after watching what I have to put up with every game haha. `\Vamos Pablo`\AYYYYYYYYYYYY, YOU HEARD ABOUT THE GOOD NEWS?
Y'ALL BEEN SLEEPING ON THE ROX, HAD A GOOD SNOOOOOOOOOZE?
WAKE UP, PELLIES, WAKE UP

`\Immediate foul after entering game or the Elijah Milsap `\Ricky Saucin! Ole! Ole!`\Because the bulls are inching closer to that number one seed....


Oh they are battling detroit for the 8th seed?


I hope the bulls do get the eight seed so the cavs can crush them one series earlier this year.`\I'm optimistic always, post a lot of OC, and make you horny. Chrimewave does the same but doesn't make you horny.`\woah every game on right now is like tied`\seems like we're better when we're losing at halftime`\Rudy has been so disappointing during our cold streak. He's doing a bit better today, but he really needs to get it going if we wanna have any shot of making the playoffs.`\I don't think you quite understand what 'low-key' means.`\we've been shit since JaKarr left`\I think we could play the Thunder close. We were competitive against them in that 1-8 matchup a few years ago.

He was a student of mine, until he got hooked on the SuperCool.`\Lowry pretty clearly got his hand on the ball. I think a personal is the right call, flagrant would be surprising.`\why JB insists on playing brewer is beyond me`\DeRozan needs to start being aggressive. I'm forgetting he's out there.`\he blocked delly and the commentators said howard swallowing him up on the baseline`\Probably should have won it last year (Curry definitely deserved it, though) but with the Rockets being the huge disappointment they have been for this season, no chance Harden would be mentioned especially with all the negative publicity Harden has gotten this season by the media with the McHale firing, Dwight trading, Khloe whatever, etc.`\If you don't like zero effort and dogshit shooting, you don't like Houston basketball.`\FREE BEASLEY`\Jokessssssss`\We're your backup team!?

WHAT A BEAST. `\WOOOO BEV`\FUCKING SHELVIN`\https://media.giphy.com/media/kdjLVV8XgecO4/giphy.gif`\Yeah, should have been called on Z-Bo I think. `\jason terry's career will forever be remember for when he got murdered by LeBron`\Standing over the guy on the ground?  He didn't walk away.  Definitely taunting.`\Neither are the rockets, lmao.`\The loss to Brooklyn has me down. `\Put in 5 biyombos pls`\Some dude just crop dusted the fuck out of me at the casino ��`\Hayward shoved Lowry to the ground, no call? Damn these bias refs..... `\He was not. Damn danial! Stop saying this :( `\Jesus the mavs fans in here are really salty towards Utah lol`\2-33 on 3's....have the Rockets ever been *that* bad?`\Williams just got the hook`\courtney lee was such a good pick up loving him more every game`\We have been objectively screwed over by officiating in the last 2 minutes of games all year.`\I legitimately don't understand why DeRozan and Lowry complained to the point of getting ejected.   I've seen far worse officiated games. `\Yeah but we know that`\just stop`\On a brighter note, Terry Rozier had seven boards and three assists!`\>if Houston plays consistently

Lol.`\God damn KJ can hop. It's like the physics defying jump in super smash bros where you jump again while already in the air `\My mustache naturally grows in a reverse hitler`\GG Michael Beasley is good O.O great addition`\In case anyone missed this...

>*"I think we oughta send the Eurostep BACK TO EUROPE!"*

>-Tommy Heinsohn, March 11th, 2016`\Wow Kyrie`\I'd still rather have that (DeRozan getting fouled on the drive) than Lowry getting blocked cleanly. `\Ok let's go already! I hate the 10 minutes just before a game :/`\Yeah dudes only 20, and we always got hakeem around helping our centers. He could be a damn good center in a few years`\James harden is not shooting when driving. It's weird.`\[I love Cleveland!!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysmLA5TqbIY)`\Yeah, that's annoying, but the shoddy "Hey Mickey you're so fine!" when he checks in is killing me.`\They have 19 and 20 fouls called against each other yall need to chill they are not calling fouls much period, for both teams. Raptors are crying like crazy about it so yall gotta cry about it too?`\i can't even be happy with dj's night for my fantasy team because i'm on a bye this week. fuck everything about this game.`\Now for Toronto to take care of business`\Fuck this season man. Why are we playing like such shit? Why the fuck can't we hold on to games? `\Thanks, Captain Obvious. `\But we're not playing the Clippers.....`\Wtf pass to jv u selfish prick `\He's being cheeky about his timeout timing. `\Need a last 2 minute report ASAP`\He was ours :/ `\Target Center renovations "Best possible experience" yet they won't put in new seats. http://i.imgur.com/pk5BN1O.jpg`\Not as much after those last 2 shots, it's up to 31%`\THAT AND 3MO `\Clutch city baby!!!! `\You're like the Henry Miller of pediatric waiting rooms. `\Fuck you bro I'm not your bro, fuck your diabetes land, come to the land of women weather and weed, Dwight couldn't handle it because he a sugar coated bitch :)`\FUCK YOU`\WHat the hell, Rockets arre gonna win, LoL`\The PTSD is real`\You mean like the entire season?  This game is just more of the same.`\i saw that play out as they were running down the court`\BEAS!`\Vintage James`\How the fuck was that shooting?`\What just happened on that rebound sequence`\A Raptors fan trying to use rings as an argument? ������ Gtfo`\Well, Love was also injured during that series and I think he'll have a much greater impact in a potential GSW/CLE matchup. They could honestly run him at the 5 while Bogut's on the bench.`\Still wrong Capela is not French.`\Lol did we do something wrong to MIN? So much playa hatin. `\Kyle with the North Korean 3`\I can see why Adidas did it though. They don't really have a #1 guy ever since rose and his injury fiasco. They have Lillard, Rose and nothing else really. But this next footwear season they are rolling out stuff for Wiggins and Harden. So it could be neat.`\You do anything besides complain?`\Out.  I'm done.  Burn it down.  Firing McHale was the writing on the wall.`\They sometimes tighten up on that stuff in those situations to avoid the game getting too chippy and out of hand in the last minute.`\The defense was lazy; open threes on the perimeter isn't because a front court player was helping lol. They didn't want to rotate or make Harden work for it. `\And Wednesday, and lots of other games this year if we're being honest`\Glad nothing has changed about Beasley since his last stint in NBA`\Buddy Hield has his nuts out, how bout you?!`\Beard `\Probably can't at this point. Luckily for us, we've got the second best tank commander in the league. Truly Byron Scott-esque.`\43 combined turnovers... damn!`\Agreed `\Has Beas always been a shit free throw shooter?`\whenever he smiles and you can see all his teeth he is about to explode with competitive rage. `\You're a little late to the party.`\lol honestly. his shot is so "loose". Like he just lets it go and somehow it goes in`\Why Jae?`\KD does everything harden does but better`\Nah, Clips got this. Rockets just didn't show up besides Harden. `\Shoot #60 would be just fine.

"Oh nice drive James. Looked great from over here."

"Nice try James! You'll put in the effort next time buddy!"`\He has a new luis on life`\you said it! no take-backs!`\yeah, I suppose`\Since when is yelling a flop? Does that make Draymond Green the biggest flopper in the league?`\Its honestly fucking great, I love hating Houston, fuck yall`\They went to him early on B2B possessions in the post and he dribbled it off his foot both times. He's been lackadaisical for over a week now on both ends, no hustle, doesn't box out, doesn't go for rebounds, late on helps etc. Even on offense he doesn't set great picks, lazy with DHO, and doesn't dive to the rim.`\Gorgui has no idea how to play defense.`\LOL that kid digging his noise and rubbing it on his dad's shirt`\You tube Gus Johnson calls. He's legendary `\Ross is a little trigger happy.`\go pacers!`\chef bringing out some early appetizers`\Salt Turnover city`\brings me back to freshman year of college when i would just eat a fuckton of those instead of an actual meal`\Oh really? I didn't realize that, I thought since it was a flagrant 2 Ty Lue was able to pick. Not paying attention I guess.`\No, moron, I'm not avoiding anything.  I'm not answering your question because I am not Tristan Thompson, therefore I do not know what he was going to do, neither do the Cavs and neither do you.  Stop acting like this an absolute fact, it's a possibility sure, but to state that it's a fact is fucking retarded and you're making yourself seem dumber with every comment you make.  You can continue commenting here if you want but I honestly don't have time to continue arguing with someone that is this stupid.  Have a good one man.  `\LEGGO PACERS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!`\Wtf my stream went a good 10 minutes back in time.`\Kinda bummed that Lin doesn't have his hair spiked tonight. Would be perfect, considering the bobblehead.`\dwight is doing like curry tonight. 3 for 3!!!!!!!!!!!`\Whitney?`\Jazz only got 2 free throws this quarter.

Celtics only had 7, but still.  `\"So our offense can't close games, huh? Whatevs, let's try defense, lol"

-Bud, probably`\So... You like our jerseys?`\Always love a good victory over the Rockettes.`\there's a /s man. `\not really actually lol back ups were in forever`\HOLY SHIT, SCOLA HIT A THREE! ITS A CHRISTMAS MIRACLE!`\Cory Joseph needs to take 3's out of his game.`\0-9 on 3's and down by 3? Shit, I'll take it.`\?`\It's unbelievable that Quin thinks a Burke-Mack backcourt can work.`\For anyone who has any question about how much Harden brings to the Rockets offense should tune into the rest of this game. `\Wow`\He got off work early though. `\I got curious after hearing the Hornets female announcer trash Harden about his athleticism so I looked up [NBA.com's distance stats](http://stats.nba.com/tracking/#!/player/speed/?sort=AVG_SPEED_OFF&dir=1&Season=2015-16&SeasonType=Regular%20Season&DateFrom=08%2F01%2F2015&DateTo=01%2F29%2F2016&CF=MIN*G*20). This season so far, Harden is around 212th average speed on defense, 204th average speed on offense, and 214th average speed overall. That is out of 224 players tracked this season. If you look up how he compares to those who play near his mpg, he is still significantly slower than those players. So the Charlotte announcer wasn't exactly wrong to question his athleticism.`\Beasley goes off for 40. `\I'm not skilled with those and can't make a dinosaur so I'll just say good luck lol`\Favors must have killed one of the refs wives or something `\Harden is incredible `\43 combined turnovers...`\You can download it for free onto an iPhone `\Should be a no call, let the big men play`\I'm so excited for this game. Both teams are fighting to be in/stay in the playoffs. Plus JB and Harden.`\Nice pass. Audible ooooOOOOohhhs happened at my house. `\I wonder if Melissa McCarthy's movies make enough money to cover what she eats from craft services.`\uh...cause he is? He punked Curry last year too.`\Yep. There seems to be pessimism abound, and if you're a fair weather fan you might want to just take the next week or so off; however, the last stretch of our schedule has us playing the Lakers twice, Minnesota twice, and Pheonix twice. There's going to be a potential for a momentum push at the end of the year.`\So Deandre probably could have averaged 20-20 with the Mavs`\Hey upvote my last two comments so I'm at +200 even. Then never upvote me again.`\The Rockets used defense and it was somewhat effective. `\MAHNIGGAWEEKND`\First time I've seen it. Are they new?`\theres an orlando Dwight fan in the crowd.. wow such loyalty.`\Last one to the locker room has to sing/dance.`\Lebron's ego: 1.000`\Damn straight you upvote me more than /u/chrimewave`\Clock didn't stop after Giannis' dunk`\me likie`\we can only hope`\Wow what an ugly possession `\Not really
My pencil limbs don't help me out `\i hope not. bring him back in a competitive game. he's a long time vet, dropping him in to garbage time here is kind of disrespectful. trez needs the court time more.`\Ballgame. fuck`\Not even crashing the boards with Rudy shooting. Don't agree with that.`\God I hate everything about how the Rockets play.


Edit: lol at the salty Rockets fans, I mean it's not like you guys are losing the game. Oh well at least James Haren will have ample time to go to strip clubs in May`\*cough* DeMar *cough*`\We could double their points...`\Please get Zeller off the team...`\Okay be real, looked like Demar straight up swore at the ref`\True but if he's double teamed there should be somebody open somewhere `\I been meaning to check that out `\Holy hell the announcers are right... in a Houston/Toronto neither Harden nor DeMar have shot any freethrows.`\Thank jebus`\Great end to the quarter.`\It could also be that his shooting motion is just ASS. `\Jabari interviews are a national treasure.`\Not a huge fan of Ariza iso plays...`\Yes, has only started a handful of games here. Usually when Bradley is injured.`\there is a considerable chance that the jazz blow this lead and go into halftime down 7`\Of course they check `\Worth it`\no stream?`\*crickets*`\And the other was in the paint. He, along with the rest of the TNT crew, does not understand analytics`\I like the Thunder matchup`\A win is a win but it's also shame that it wasn't really the Grizzlies playing.`\Against nba defense or no?

Because if not then easy but if so... Shit there's still a chance.`\This couple went to Indianapolis for their honeymoon lol`\Have never seen worse attempts at inbounding, holy hell`\ye she did`\There we go Dwight lol god he has bricks for hands sometimes `\the singularity`\earlier this season I legitimately wished we would just bring the Rio Grande Valley Vipers up and send all of our guys to the D-League`\I guess hand checking is legal now??`\nope, never heard of it. i should go watch it now because we're folding pretty fast.`\Yet you are only picking out the games where we lose or Kevin does bad. He was great last night but no one talks about him then.`\Honestly if dwight starts out missing his fts id hack him. He seems to have a hard time getting out of that kind of slump.`\BALL DONT LIE

Howard lol`\*COUGH* REFS *COUGH*

Yeah they just cant catch up`\Harden is basically mid 2000s Kobe at this point. Elite guard surrounded by a lack of talent; but at least Kobe had Phil during his 35.4 ppg season`\i need a clip of Harden locking up Kyrie`\What happened?`\Hood is 2/12. Woof.`\h4rden`\I miss my dad`\Please bench ingles`\damn, really? he seemed like a solid versatile PF`\Probably some Sidney Lowe influence there`\Raps fan really think they could get the one seed too. ��`\kyrie and love coming out might have more to do with that`\The 5 pieces of Exodia wreaking havoc.`\I like Big Howie's game`\that way Timmy has a chance of beating all other Western teams in the playoffs?`\John Wall is super quick he'd be my #1 just on the eye test `\HAHAHAHA get over it man`\I'll gladly eat my words`\Give me some mo of DMOOO`\trust in the lord, for he shall set you 3`\I really wish Mickey was in and not Amir. `\Lmao your two best players spent the entire fucking game jawing at the refs and get kicked out and Beverley is the ass? Take the L please. Y'all got lots of wins already, we need this to make the playoffs lol`\Always does, but if we're losing a close game in the last minute he won't pass no matter what `\James Harden is the man.

Another triple double for the Beard. `\Because Harden threw his arm up like a diva. `\I laughed at this Covington flop too`\That's not entirely true. There was one time a nuggets post game thread never even got made lol!`\Hmm, I wonder what's wrong with your brain.`\r you fucking serious`\That's what you get for letting Hayward walk freely baseline.... Right now no one on Raps making life difficult on Hayward. Once they figure him out this game will be over.`\Please give trez minutes. Significant minutes.`\oooffff cccooouuurrrssee
`\Of course Mavs want to do the unusual and win a game `\6 full timeouts plus 1 twenty second timeout per half. So a potential of 8 timeouts. `\If you click the blue link on the top by each team name it takes you to it `\Let's get him to run through a football gauntlet with the basketball`\Easy... Two entrances and two counters in their existing locations. One is for the hot dog King and the other the Burger King. `\His PER should be approaching infinity after this game, so there's that.`\Bye Bye Derozan`\Pretty sure he's soaked himself dry by now.`\Probably not surprising to any of the Rockets fans... But Harrell has the best +/- on the Rockets again, at +9 for tonight.`\dj ain't as fast as a hype train`\I LOVE YOU IT`\Oh ffs just when i had my hopes up `\Making up for the lack of Jazz homerism over the last two decades.`\Some real chompers`\What do you mean "talk about **this** after the game"? You mean the game itself? Yeah, the post game thread is usually a place for people to talk about the events of the game. `\At the end of the day, we've won two titles in our history and went to the WCF last year. We could lose the rest of the season and the Rockets name would still have more pedigree than the Raptors. You can't really talk from a position of superiority in regards to your team's relevancy when we're still waiting on it to exist.`\But 4th quarter Captain Clutch`\I'm fine with it being a foul, but waaaaaaaay obvious?  I don't think so.  Biz brought his arms down but never hit Hayward.`\Hood has been really bad lately.`\Beasley 4 fouls in 9 minutes :,)`\[You ready /u/BizGilwalker ?](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/4a25kd/post_game_thread_the_houston_rockets_3332_defeat/d0wrwxm)`\girls got guns`\hate when my stream is so far behind

B3V`\rudy gobert`\trey lyles `\Maybe he banged the scorekeepers dog.`\Great effort by harden to tap that back out`\tfw rose and bev are close friends`\How the hell is that a foul?`\God bless Lance Stephenson`\You have to adapt to the refs that's basketball and lue isn't adapting, it sucks but the rockets are really good at playing refs and they are getting away with physical defense. Got to switch it up and put your athletes in and let kyrie work with those guys.

That bench unit lue had in was awful and a lil showboaty imo.`\Oh and a Cavs fan bitching about it too. Pretty routine day. `\I wonder if a bank like BMO stays open late on Sundays...`\It was all mental. Hes so athletic I feel like he's got a good upward potential. `\BALL DON'T LIE`\I think Boston has one of the nicest basketball courts in the NBA. What are your guys' favorite basketball courts?`\Hood needs to have another kid, hes been cold lately. `\Cavs better not choke this lol`\Our other colour commentator is even better.`\Drink drank dunk`\I don't see you guys beating us but you would give us a better series than the jazz or Blazers so I don't want that .`\Yo i hate the other team just as much but i think the refs have been shitty for everyone.`\Beasley was cooking, glad to see him having success on the rockets! `\I have him tagged simply as "Racist"`\Is Lance not playing tonight?`\There has to be something to the Hayward/Mack connection. Look at Mack's numbers before he came here. His confidence is crazy and he was immediately comfortable when he hit the floor for the Jazz. `\More like BiiIIIIiiiNGO`\He should replace 'league' with 'world'`\When Dwight intentionally goes after someone's knees and starts setting picks like he is a linebacker we'll talk`\I like how he bodies someone up as a 6'10" dude and the does that spin move across the lane with the flick. That shot looks like money and he got it off every time against love.`\Lol, so dumb`\Terrence Jones say goodbye to any minutes for the rest of the season`\his eyes look busted.`\I'm no expert, Kevin, but yes.`\Was the rumor that James harden partying all the time during critical series ever confirmed ?`\Mack :(`\Yeah, I don't disagree with that point. But saying that he only "spots up and shoot free throws," well, that's blatantly wrong.`\Fuck bicker staff. We should've at least kept McHale and let him go proper at the end of the season and be in talks with another coach (please be tom thibodeau) and we would've been A LOT better off. `\when has Bill said he wants Gobert on the Celtics?`\Missed calls.`\I liked Beasley's responses in that interview.`\Oh...good thing we swept u guys early then :)`\Pretty damn satisfying actually considering the Rockets short comings. `\Offensive goaltending...`\Just checkin in. 7 point game? Really Jazz?`\Also, hella though schedule since then. Brooklyn is the only game we should've won. Vs SAS, vs BKN, @ BOS, @TOR, @MEM is not easy`\gg`\GTFO REF. i heard the ball slap through my speakers.`\Which we rarely ever do`\LFG Houston`\Wow what a soft ass call`\Not only does that amaze me, but the fact that you can find that in under 2 minutes just shows how amazing the internet is.`\Gorgi has a better offensive game than Dwight. `\Silly Gordo`\Because he protected himself while the ball was still live`\Did you all know that Beasley played in [China?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDrfE9I8_hs)`\He reminds of of Faried, is that a fair comparison?`\That's not good `\This triggered me. Fuck you Northern Iowa, Fuck you.`\His hair was actually spiked pregame, but he flattened it, maybe for good luck? `\Damn, this game went from 0 to 100 real quick.`\Lol Beas `\Lettss goooo! GL Hornets`\Come on Jazz. Let's make this playoff push interesting `\Why would a Rocket chase bradley? Odds are he misses that dunk today.`\casey`\TRAVEL !!!!`\Fortunately James Harden's back has healed from last year for our playoff push. Everyone hop on.

Averaging 36pts/gm over the past couple weeks`\Someone fire the medical staff.`\The man went full ballerina though, speaking as flop experts, I think that's a flop.`\God damn I love watching us play like this!`\pass. the. fucking. ball.`\Legit`\Rockets better than spurs? I'll take it `\If you were a little taller what would you do? Would you go do it and be a baller?`\the freedawkins comments tomorrow are gonna be ugly`\Average margin tonight was 19.3 points. Thank you Jazz/Cavs for having a comparatively close game tonight.`\Not enough time`\BDL`\It's a toss up, we hypothetically might've missed the next Millsap. JK, glad we've got Mack right now.`\oh my goodness gracious`\We really could've used Gordon Giricek tonight.`\Gotta say it though, Hayward has become masterful at drawing fouls. `\The Rockets' entertainment is great/hilarious.. But Orbit, man.. Our baseball mascot, he's the tits.`\Ref with a foul!!`\6 ft is being generous `\hayward didnt really get stopped in that game. ill take that result in this game.`\True, but he actually shot well for a good portion of the game. He did better this game than last, that's for sure. `\Refs decide to come into the second quarter just calling random shit on Dwight.`\KJ 3`\Yup. Harden, Bev and Capela might be the only players on the roster from this team in like 2 years.`\how`\I think we actually lost the game where he scored 50, and then the other time he did we beat GSW. you guys beat the bulls twice tho so at least you have that going for you. `\Our Symphony is pretty good.`\Dude comes up clutch a lot when we have to play in small line up it seems, love his hustle`\proof of concept`\Most definitely arguable, I don't know Hayward much, I'll make sure to watch more Jazz games.`\No fancy passes please James `\STOP SHOOTING, LOWRY.
Drive and KICK!`\(When I get home in like 10 minutes) I can still post the whole box score in the comments and you can copy and paste it (maybe!)

OR if you want to create one of complete box scores yourself (easily, I swear!), go back in my post history for any of the [Post Game Threads] and find the link to the Excel generator at the bottom of the post. Just put in the two teams and the date, then click the button and copy the output.

`\i just don't get why they always leave it until the end. if they played with that effort earlier in the game or even earlier in the 4th, this game would've been over.`\WOW WTF IS THIS>`\Really wanted that poster and it did look like Sully got into him, but what can you do this game.`\FUCK HOUSTON ! PLAYOFF TIME FOR UTAH`\So close `\Z-Bo is now 94th All Time in Points Scored`\SUPER COOL BEAS `\KJ needs to be on the floor right now`\Shelvin is shooting something like 48% from 3 in a Jazz uniform.`\............ WHAT`\Bev: "I love you"

DeRozan: "I know"`\https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztVnYrrTzYE`\i just dont think theres any chance we really compete with the warriors or spurs. maybe we take a game, but we'd get smashed by 20 multiple times.
`\Bold`\beasley? oh dear lord.`\God they just can't close those last few points. `\TROY DANIELS SIGHTING`\Ariza is playing amazing today.. holy shit. `\Okay, I can understand that, but she makes it seem like he applies no effort on both ends of the floor, which is ridiculous. He drives hard to the paint every night and takes more of a beating than 99% of the people in the league.`\Nah`\Well who the fk would our best PF be? Because I have no idea

Edit: Holy crap just realized TJones doesn't get minutes anymore`\Don't worry, Jason Terry won't let that happen.`\Mark Price is still well known. You want to test Cavs fans? Ask them about Bobby Sura or Brevin Knight..or even Trajan Langdon. Mark Price was a part of the last Cavs boom period, so he's pretty well known. Start talking about that late 90s dark period when Shawn Kemp got fat and Z couldn't get his feet fixed and that's where you'll see the true fans.`\Lol avoiding it again because it completely ruins your argument. He obviously wasn't going to do either of those. The Cavs held all the leverage. Aw don't get offended now cause you were proven wrong.`\I think it's pretty cool.`\Zeller can go to hell`\Well GG Houston`\I think we earned the right to make fun of the Clippers until someone else comes back from a 3-1 deficit`\LEBRON CHOSE THE WRONG SG TO SLEEP ON`\Ooooh Dmo starting`\was saying that if it was Chi vs Tor 1st round, Bulls would be the favourite. Mark Jackson told him not to disrespect Toronto like that.`\I'm looking at the Grizzlies lineup right now and I think it is legitimately worse than the Sixers. That team is a skeleton crew.`\Do you watch Clip games?`\Let them play
`\Im so happy to see him getting back after the back injuries.`\lol at that houston possession `\CJ Miles stared down the basket and whispered... fuck the rockets. `\Yeah, reason I was asking is because Harden was so far ahead of Westbrook last year, but only because Westbrook missed 15-20 games IIRC.`\AVERY!!!!`\I turned that one off. I'm also an aggie that turned off the Northern Iowa game. I'd like to say I've learned my lesson but I'll probably mess up the next great comeback.`\lol. Say Go Rockets one time, try it, its fun`\Outasight- the boogie is the song for anyone wondering`\;)`\He said that? Lol`\cavs coaching just baffles me`\LeBron is a pilgram hat short of looking like a John Proctor cosplayer. `\Nah, just Kyle tings.`\Is this a joke?  Leo didn't deserve this year's Oscar.`\A coach who is willing to try other fuckn players`\Too bad when the players bring it, but the refs aren't up to the task. `\H-Town man, what can I say.`\Dwight needs to step it up, awful game from him. `\Can y'all go a loss without blaming the refs? `\Alright, seeing as you guys really like Brewer and hate Wiggins so much, lets trade`\his defense has been shit this year. the rockets wouldnt be bottom 5 if he was good`\By big teams, do you mean the games against OKC and Spurs? Because I don't see how you are just giving more value to 2 or maybe 3,4 games (if you are counting some other teams) than the handful of losses we have had? `\FUCK

OUTTA

HERE`\That play sums up the season minus the going in part`\You can be happy for 24 hours, but at the end of the day we're a 41-20 team, while you're struggling to make the playoffs, with players that don't even want to be there. `\Well Pau has 5, sometimes it happens `\36 for Parker, 30 for Middleton, and a triple-double for Giannis. Great night to be a Bucks fan!`\whut`\They're turning him into Matt Bonner`\Guys. It's the curse of the green jerseys. The entire road trip has been played in our alternates. Maybe if we just play the first quarter in green and then play the rest of the game in blue.`\it boggles the mind. and we still win games sometimes??

`\i know our game is still in the throes, but houston is up 3 on milwaukee nearing the end of the third`\Why not even try Harrell when Parker has been killing us?`\KAT < PAT`\First to 100 right?`\Is Casey trying to get JV minutes because his D has been terrible and he's not getting anything on offense in the 4th`\Good defense tbh. Demar needs to stop sulking and just dunk that shit instead of fading`\The Bulls have also beaten those teams PLUS OKC twice...we still .500 tho :(`\Just tuned in. Dammit Howard.`\I dont know why people hate leo. I think he is great.

I cant imagine him not being there. Leo is real as hell. Leo, Jack and Matt works really well.`\Ft's in a game? Gotta be Wilt right?`\Fuck you refs.  Every fucking game.  I can't believe it's not all over the news how clearly biased they are`\batum for lilliard straight up?`\You get a foul and you get a foul and you get a foul....

Didn't know this was Oprah`\haha..`\Ever so significantly`\Tbh any night when Harden isn't ball out is a rough one.`\Was that really a foul? Or was it a Jason Kidd leg kick...`\I dont get why ppl act like theyre not fouling Dwight`\There ya go, Dwight.`\This is what happens when Demar doesn't go to the line 15 times`\Harden boffs pretty much every late clock situation `\I can tell you're not bitter`\I don't even know how to feel about beating a team that has fewer NBA caliber players than the 76ers`\I think that video applies more to you than to me.

Imagine banning a guy from a sub (who has never once trolled on that sub) for something as harmless as predicting a Jazz loss and pointing up an objective stat on the /r/nba gamethread, not to troll, but to lament (see my Jazz flair)?

And then you follow it up by calling me a "fucking doofus" when I blamed the 1/12 FG% as the reason for our struggles and not the refs.

Just... lol.`\Do you guys still like Kanter, or is the honeymoon over?

Personally, I liked watching him play, just wished he didn't piss on everything on his way out the door.`\I hope to fuck we don't face youz guyz in the playoffs but besides that no bad blood.

Listen to Powell halftime interview. This was all about perimeter players actually picking up the energy and I think getting that 8 second violation made them pick it up.

This isn't about the front court. The defense on the perimeter needed improving and did in spades.`\Plenty of great dunks this game!`\Yep, I agree

Harden has had 2 instances this season where he got called for a flagrant...on offensive drives to the rim`\Maybe a team meeting BEFORE playing the Warriors, Spurs, Thunder, or Clippers`\Boston's announcers are awesome. Er, maybe my hatred of Harping clouds my vision.`\Crazy how Smitch still doesn't make any adjustments.

(maybe)`\Bull fucking shit`\It is so frustrating that we don't seem to give a fuck until we're down 15+ in the 2nd half.`\3 out of 4 on dunk hype.   I want Beas to get one at the last minute. `\Reddick!!!!`\They literally started saying "What are we doing there?" and "we need to get back in the offense" at points. `\So him falling over backwards because he thought the dude was going be there to lean on means he's trying to take out knees? Fuck out of here with that bullshit. Maybe if your team weren't a bunch of headcases and lived up to their talent you guys wouldn't have to drum up so many excuses`\EURO`\miles is my favorite plumlee`\Yeah im not even going to care about the inevitable 4th quarter collapse. I just love seeing Giannis and Jabari play this well`\But at least it's not toxic like the Spurs, Trailblazers and Utah threads. Those were rough.`\Me too, I want a better pick!`\I think you're okay. That jumper is still broke.`\Why are we setting picks for Beasley? that's not his game`\Nice start to the quarter `\WOAH`\We are a strong independent team that don't need to have a good second quarter. `\People there actually call it that? :/`\yo that guy that just came on for the grizzlies looks terrifying holy`\Someone needs to get a clip of Harpring saying "6 inches long".  It's going to be my text alert from now on`\We sent him to the D-league and he became a D-League All star, so we like him.`\How the fuck was that a foul?`\DON'T LEAVE THEM OPEN `\Délly`\We've had Ariza on JJ this whole time`\Oh shit Hood might have a concussion `\You're so cool`\CMON ROCKETS I BELIEVE`\You're right`\Lets dispel with this fiction that Tyronn Lue knows what he's doing`\Personally, I feel like it's the team you guys just beat.

I am in agreement, though, I'd love to see the Jazz as a sparky 8 seed.`\Brad Stevens still looks like he stole a suit from his dad's closet.`\Brew was playing the 4 when we went up by 5, we made that run because we went small.

I shat on the decision at the time, but it worked.`\76ers beating the Nets right now is glorious`\My mind cannot comprehend the terrible defensive rotations by the rockets.

I'm from Toronto. But I am an avid Jazz follower also. Since my main chick is so well of, I'm kinda rooting for my sick chick cause this game is more important for them`\Maybe Harden should focus that much on defense. `\Do you have a personal vendetta against JV? `\Nononononono`\Holy crap, a weatherman telling the 7 day forecast, was also part of the halftime show?`\Consistency is key.`\thats got to be one of my favorite  spongebob moments of all time`\we are actually falling apart`\Rubio.

But we definitely will grow from this.`\What's worse for them is even if they overtake the Blazers, they're still up against OKC.

That even happened in the 1st where our 3's were not falling and we kept shooting them and eventually got red hot.

Our problem is that you CANNOT do that in the 4th.  You literally have to change tactics.  Get Love in the post, let Kyrie get some layups, get TT some feeds, ANYTHING besides shooting a 3 is better than trying to shoot 3's when they aren't falling.

We always do this and it has cost us so many games.`\Well, yeah, obviously. That would be nice.

We did. That's on us`\Beasley is the only midrange player on our team.`\I don't like that Harden drive looking for foul garbage. `\Are there even refs in the game?  Are they in the concourse getting some nachos?`\Looks like Lance is getting caught up in trying to be better than everyone.`\I think JET might have a season or two left in him.`\Not sure that's what he's saying`\Bev has the best +/- on the team with +20 tonight?

Would think a Philly fan would understand`\Yes`\Please let Beasley play the entire 4th. Hes a lock for at least 35 pts`\what happened to you guys? weren't you guys on a streak a while back?`\Because as it currently stands they are a sub .500 team and I have never felt that a team with a losing record should or deserves to be in the playoffs.

Could that change?  Sure.  But the question is being asked right now and as of now, the answer is no.`\holy shit`\Bad at basketball`\I dont think he leaves and I'd be surprised if Morey cant find him support also. This season sucks but the blame falls on everyone `\I mean shit, I used to pick up a dozen free tickets from Twitter in 2012. It was pretty bad.`\Watching the Rockets try to get the ball inbounded was so fucking painful`\I guess....

I mean every basket is +10 for a team and -10 for the other. It's just really inflated. `\JJ redick is my biggest regret for the Spurs..... He has so much potential and was so undervalued for so long. I wanted him every year... Felt like he would have been a great spur .`\You guys could really help us tomorrow night too.`\This game is hilarious.

>A game like tonight, where he tightened the rotation and went for the kill, can be big for him - as much for his own confidence as players'.

>Don't doubt for a second there's a confidence balance for coaches, especially newer, younger guys in the league. Quin is still learning too.

>I think tonight was a potentially big step for him. Can see his guys don't mind sacrificing if it means Ws on the board. Will do it happily.

>Anyway, I could be miles off. Could ask Quin, he might tell me I'm full of it and it was all matchups/scenarios tonight.`\Yeah, he's doing about 20 of them this season.`\Seriously! He's a  Fucking beast! `\lol, /u/nuke-the-moon is so fucked.`\Hasn't started yet.`\I swear our bigs have bricks for hands `\This game has devolved into FT shooting.  That 1st half was so much fun `\Jimmy Buckets +28 tonight`\Gritty win for the Jazz with so much talent not on the floor, Hood and Lyles looked great (btw that ejection of Lyles was BS.)

Lyles-Favor-Gobert frontcourt has such a bright future, and with wing talent like Hood,Hayward and Burks the Jazz are gonna be **Scary**....***SCARY***`\The clippers imploded. That's how `\P Bev is a good defender. Hes played really hard on Lowry. DeMar is just making great reads on the D and finding the open man`\Sloppy.`\Any day of the week he is. Name 5 better. `\Come on, man.`\we bringing the atl aau legends back to wreck shop. `\You're very welcome. He's mentally broken.

The crowd is regularly empty even when the team is playing well. I don't think the people who go to the Rodeo and go to Rockets games are the same people. Sure, the rodeo probably affected some of the attendance, like 30 people max, but it looks like that even when the rodeo isn't going. `\I sense darkness in you`\Shhh, Dwane Casey could be reading this...`\Gg!`\*Types out "Damn Danial" joke*

*Deletes it hesitantly* `\I hope Lance isn't discouraged by the technical. He can't take the blow to his confidence and frankly I think it'd be cool if he celebrated every basket with a random sucker punch to an opposing player but that's probably just me `\well he did just turned the ball over 3 times straight`\Proved what exactly? That we got beat by an actually healthy Grizz team?

But cool the Rockets beat a bunch of guys on 10 day contracts. Congrats`\After the pair of 3s with a toe on the line McDermott just decided to step 6 feet behind the line.`\damn they're really letting those loose balls go. Not even a whistle for the tie up.`\I'm trying to stick it out.  And I can't even be mad, because HALF OF OUR FUCKING TEAM has been out of the D-league for less than a week.  I feel bad for these guys. `\underrated post defender`\Why are the raptors so bad now T_T`\Reality check for Celtics fans. The Celtics are not invincible, but fuck it ROZIER IS A COMPETENT PLAYER HYPE!!!`\SHELVIN FUCKING MACK`\Because it's negative about the team I guess.  I love my Rockets, but I know that unless they're killing it, the vast majority of people in Houston simply don't give a shit.`\All I want is a Rockets big man that can shoot FTs above 60%`\Is.....is this what offense is like?`\Austin Rivers is like Schrodinger's Basketball Player in the sense that people's thoughts on him vary depending on whether or not he is being observed in that moment. He is caught in a universe where people don't know whether he is good or bad or if he even exists at all.`\how to layup`\Damn it Utes. Bad first half day for both Utah teams`\Start of the season the 3rd and 4th qt were our best qt, 1st being our worst`\Seems like Bill keeps calling Hood Booker. `\LMAO Harden wanted another freethrow`\LOL beverly trolling like a little shit`\I swear Indiana has the most underrated fanbase in the history of sport. Nobody ever talks about them. Most of my friends forget they even exist. Why? They seem like a pretty good organization and Paul George is an all star. `\Still clippers, probably. 7th seed is too irrelevant for the true hatred.`\JV is having the loudest game I've ever heard`\Harden's defense though..`\I've said before, the nice part about hornets games is that the crowd is so quiet you can hear all the swear words the players shout`\come. the. fuck. on.

GET OUT ON THEIR SHOOTERS. FUCK!`\Shoutout to early tips offs got me fucked up at happy hour`\we have not been looking good as of late`\thats really not true actually. hes had some cool eurostep fingerroll types`\It's the 2nd quarter..`\LOL`\dallas still getting nailed to a cross in sacramento`\is this actually happening`\Matching...like, this game?

Because he's not a better player than Harden`\Woah. Pump the brakes.`\Yeah, leave the guy with the hot hand wide open in the corner...`\SOOO QUICK SO SMOOTH SOOO JABARI!`\Bet money we package that pick into a trade, just can't see us getting younger if plan on keeping Harden around `\Lebron is 5-8 in Utah. Don't know what it is but he doesn't do well in Salt Lake City. `\is the thread fucked up for anybody else? i can't see any comments`\Who will come out on top? What is the top? More disappointment? `\James seems a bit frustrated`\he had disc surgery and those affect your lateral quickness greatly. mchale said recently that it's affected Dwight's lateral quickness a lot and that's why he's been bad guarding PnRs`\He fucking fell before any contact... fuck Hardens flopping ass.`\After that DeRozan dunk I think it doesn't get worse than that`\Did anyone see that fan crying? `\Trey Lyles is going to be huge for this team. Hood already is.

Fucking love this team.`\JJ Has been playing great to start the game.`\We are gonna get killed because Patrick said so.


LET'S GO WOLVES!`\How many minutes total has Burke played in the last 5 games?`\jesus, nique. i'll give you a pass on the first time, but when you go back to the 'bev can't shoot 3s' line that just tells me you can't be bothered to look at game notes. he's our best 3 shooter on the season at +40% and has been top 15 in the league almost all season.`\Was good last game too, got 20pts`\Finally Vince! He needed that 3 to go in`\Why are the Cavs the only team getting called for fouls?`\OH GOD DAMNIT JUST STAHP, CLEVELAND `\Man, Lyles came to play today!`\whoa`\it's not creepy, it's called chemistry
`\Whew`\So looks like Smith wants Ariza to cut. Ariza is open towards the corner and staying there. Smith avoids passing to the open and on fire Ariza. `\We're hoping Lyles will be that third big we can use to combat the Olynyks of the league.`\Put it in his contract `\sucks that he's fat`\Honestly when it's all said and done I'm glad Beasley had a good game. China seems to have matured his game a lot.`\Thank you from Blazer fans as well`\Prob gonna go to OT`\WTF Dunleavy?`\Powell looking decent!

Edit: Not that shot`\en`\That's exactly what I mean. CJ is hustling like a maniac, and it's usually to our benefit. The skill set isn't totally there, but the effort is.`\I'm kidding. I can't stand Olympus kids but I'm sure I can still respect DL`\Damn, Ish just put Harden on skates a little bit`\It's too early to tell if your sentiment is correct and your metaphor sucks.`\its a mistake
`\Deandre Jordan definately related to wilt the stilt `\dude is ALWAYS grinding, he's arguably my favorite houston athlete behind watt and keuchel or maybe correa`\DAGGER`\Sloppy/stupid plays for both sides the last few possessions. That Dunleavy missed three was baffling.`\I know which one I'd prefer `\Hayward won't let us lose tonight. Calling it now`\That was a terrible call.`\Michael Beasly is a boss. D-Mo and harden were playing pretty well.
Ariza seems so inconsistent and I never really have an opinion on Patrick Beverley. But that was a good game.`\James Harden with that shot boi.


lol`\Banning someone from a team subreddit for predicting a loss on an /r/nbagamethread strikes me as pretty reactionary.  Especially since, you know, I've *never* posted anything remotely troll-like on the Jazz subreddit.

Calling someone a "twat", "fucking doofus", "kid", and "fucking debbie downer" strikes me as a hell of a lot more inappropriate, but to each his own I suppose.`\I'm buying Coach Joeger some goddamn bubble wrap so we will have A player left by the end of the season.`\Because knowing of Terry Schiavo is the best way to tell if someone is smart or not...`\Don't think they run the shot clock during warmups...`\turnnnovers`\We don't defend anything, so you've still got us beat.`\and if DD had hit him in the middle of the chest he would have got the charge.

We were still in the lead when I made my comment, so no, I was not crying about us blowing the fucking lead because it was not blown at the time. `\Yeah, that's weird.

It was terrible but that's mostly because of the size advantage. Powell can lose his man, look at the Hawks game for game footage for that. Lowry has had his share of bad runs over the year.

Good, not excellent. None of those guys are all-nba defenders and can have their own lapses. Just like they did in the first half until they picked it up, just like Powell said.

Help defense isn't where you should be looking at, statistically and if you break down the game footage, you'll see the problem is on the perimeter. Again, none of these guys are all-nba defenders.

Relieved Raps don't share a conference with powerhouse teams like the Warriors, Nuggets, Kings, and Rockets.  (Throw the Bulls in and there's 12 of 23 losses)

Also when's the last time the Raptors played at full strength?  And by full strength I mean only without DC.  Ross is a legit three point threat and good at what he does, and this team suffers considerably without him.

Also I will not be able to watch anyone on the Raps shoot FT in the fourth quarter of any playoff games.

Last time it was Brewer that hit 5 threes against the Raptors, special shoutout to Pat Bev for picking up the slack in this one.`\you should probably care more about the mavs losing cause then both the Rockets and the Jazz could make it. Mavs have a hard schedule coming up.`\I like your optimism!`\Hopefully nobody comes in here and yells and curses about the refs because I will look at them and say that we lost that game ourselves.

DeMar started getting frustrated early in the quarter when the lead was dwindling. He even slammed the ball when the refs saved them and called the foul on Corey because Capella did not foul him. He was not fouled by Capella on that drive before the T. No idea why we didn't have someone move over when PadPat decided to double on the cheap ass weak pick they pulled. If we decided to double Harden, then do it. Don't do it on that cheap fake pick. It's just so that we fall for it. Same thing when Washington pulled JV on that last year.

I feel at times that Nique hurts my basketball IQ because he provides no useful insight or analysis to compliment Bob Rathburn's play by play commentary. What is the other team doing schematically? What are their strengths? What are their weaknesses? Where is the behind the scenes info that a former star in the league should be able to provide? You get none of those topics from Dominique Wilkins.

Nique's formula for commentary:

- Repeat what Rathburn JUST said in a much less eloquent fashion.

- Preface everything you say with "Again..." so when you have repeated it for the 87th time, the audience assumes you are really driving the point home and not at a creative loss for unique material.

- "Again, (Insert Name of Player Guarding Teague) just can't guard Jeff Teague."

- "Again, I don't know what the (Opposing Team) are doing leaving Kyle Korver that open."

He was literally WIDE open in the corner multiple possessions in a row. Refs definitely should have been calling a few more fouls for both sides, but nothing game changing. DeMar's ejection was justified, he gets into the refs way too often. Just play ball dude, if they give you the call consider it a bonus.

Beverly: I don't give a shit`\Imo, I think Harden is find. He's an all-star caliber player and one of the top sg in the league. I feel like Harden's still young, and the only way the Rockets are gonna win a championship is if Harden becomes more of a leader. Yes, he's not the best defender, but neither is someone like Steph Curry. Harden at least does a decent job at getting steals, and plus he does a lot of work on the offensive side. He averages the second most points in the nba rn. And Harden is worthy of being #1 on a team. Look at the work he put in last year.. He straight up carried an injured ass Rockets team to 2nd place in the West. If anything, we should get rid of Howard. He's not worth what he paid.... `\Alright, games been interesting enough.

Good job expert. lol`\Jingles looks like he works at a Staples`\I wish we had James Harden. He's a boss.`\Harden is a fantastic player. We have no idea how to stop him. Triple double without having to go to the line as much as he usually does. He is the real deal.

Howard is a frustrating player to watch from both the home and away team perspective. He's good enough that you can't really ignore him when he's on the floor, but you have no idea if he's going to give a crap. In the end he ended up being a net negative, but I just have to throw my hands up watching him play.

KLow and DeRozan need to fuckin' chill. Had they known that the Raptors would still keep themselves in the game until the final seconds, they would have made a difference despite their disappointing games.

Kudos to JV for his stat line while playing extended time on 5 fouls, but if he played with a bit more focus from the start, he wouldn't have put himself in that position.

Norman Powell getting some significant burn in Ross's place. Ross would have made the difference in crunch time with Lowry and DeRozan out IMO, but Powell did such a great job early on keeping in front of Harden on defence. Knocked down some shots and even ran the floor seamlessly with the team. What a pickup by Masai on draft day. Love it.

Being a Houston fan must be so frustrating. You have so much talent, but they played so up and down this game, and I imagine that's the story of their season. They still got the win and Houston fans should be proud of Harden's play this game, but damn, the lack of focus throughout the game, especially at the end...yeah, they should have put the game away after the double-ejection and won by at least 10.

Refs aside, that was a great game from both teams.`\Well done Tristan. Moron`\That's okay because the Jazz get hosed the most by the refs. They led the league in wrong calls against them in those last 2 minutes reports. `\DAGGER `\https://twitter.com/andyblarsen/status/703009208996761600`\I still don't know what you're talking about.

Inb4 "Rockets announcers are the worst in the league".`\Yeah he's playing with a lot of heart and hustle even if he's still readjusting to the competition on this side of the world he's giving it everything he has and that's all you can ask for!

1. He's been playing out of position all year long at SF because he's too weak for many PFS. However, what he lacks in strength he makes up for in speed because PFS cant keep up with him.

2. He's really not that great of a shooter, we saw him average 20 ppg and lead the league in 4th quarter scoring for an entire month last year. How did he score? Slashing. He's actually a really good slasher and he got to a line like Harden in a PFs body. This explains why he's so streaky from the 3. He'll have really shitty shooting nights but then he'll have nights where he goes 9/12, 6/8, 7/10 from 3 and those will average out to ~40% for the most part.

We also don't have a solid offense which is why I don't know how I feel trading him to another team because someone more qualified than what we have is going to figure out how to use him and he's going to be ridiculous. `\> bounced the ball

Can confirm.

Great teams are consistent. The thing that boggles my mind is we went from being consistent to inconsistent while trading away benchwarmers. Too bad we'll probably have to wait for a few years till someone spills the beans on what the problem was.`\Rockets couldn't win even with Dwight trying to cheat.  lol`\Yeah, I think I've seen the unicycle/bowl woman's routine about a dozen times this year.`\Jambalaya and gumbo.

Draymond, Kawhi as forwards, Duncan or DJ. But is there a better defender at guard? `\The wheels have officially fallen off for houston`\Boler guaranteed he'll be back, so there ya go.
`\Harden`\He's banging some r&amp;b chick and she used to fuck with partynextdoor and he posted a pic holding her hand on IG saying 'I knew you would be back' and deleted it right away. `\Typical anemic Rockets third quarter.`\He does everything slow. I used to hate it, but it's proven to be effective enough. `\Oh? I didn't know the game was over already. What are they doing with this extra minute?`\It starts at the end of the 3rd actually. It's when they put in Austin and Jamal.`\Bill Worrell is so tilted right now`\This team can't pass for shit LMFAO`\I don't get why C. Webb keeps mentioning it every 5 minutes.`\the rockets of posts. lol. `\That's Triple-Double-Recording Matt Barnes to you.`\Well yeah, but if anyone else was gonna get hurt it might as well be Hairston. He might be a warm body, but he contributes as much as a cold one would.`\Get back to me at the end of the year buddy`\2 years away baby.`\calvin ready for prom`\about 86 mill which is 8th in the nba lol`\thats NBA champion and jazz legend, kendrick perkins`\[Shhhh.](http://www.latimes.com/sports/nba/la-sp-mavericks-rockets-20150429-story.html)`\Danial y dont u just switch on over to our side fam?`\I got in contact with him through soundcloud and bought his album, great guy`\Bismack needs to start`\can we plz win`\Why is Ariza tying to act so tough`\coming for you miami!`\No one cares anymore, we went to the WCF last year while you were watching on your couches, biting your nails about LMA leaving`\I guess I worded it poorly.

But dfs price is related to how many points they score, which comes from how many points, rebounds, assists, steals, blocks, and turnovers per game. There's no way he deserves to be consistently priced highly if he didn't have the production to match it. So going by that, he's definitely in the top 10 in the nba`\This game is hard to watch...`\Most important stat of the half.`\wtf is ppat's 3pt shooting percentage this season?

DO YOUR THING, SUPER COOL!`\3asley too easily`\tbh rumours and personal lives aren't appropriate to be talking about in the broadcast so i hope they dont`\Capela's struggle really makes no sense to me. In his last season in Europe before he came to the NBA, he shot 52 or 94 freethrows for 55%. It's not great by any means, but much better the 38% he is shooting now.

So it's either mental, fatigue, or they're reworking his shot so everything is messed up right now. I'm really hoping it's the last one because his free throw shooting woes can really hurt the team. `\I'm embarrassed that someone actually bought that and wore it in public. `\nope`\True, some of them are quite good. Don't forget the [lady on the tall unicycle with the bowls](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5MjD3TYVzo).

`\He should come to H-Town.`\I'm perfectly calm. `\Yes. `\lol Greg was too open on that layup`\The problem with our team is that we consistently trade 3s for 2s.

Kyrie had a bunch of pics with her on Valentine's Day they were going out. `\Not nearly as effective as "fuck the rockets"`\Ehh, #2 pick in the draft, played big minutes with the heat pre lebron, played big minutes with the twolves and Suns, off court issues everywhere, redemption attempt with the heat, more issues, cut played in China, picked up by the rockets. Diamond in the rough means he was a hidden treasure but he's a known quantity and was always an elite scorer. Like a poor mans Carmelo. `\Fucking Brewer`\BS call.`\the highs are higher. but the lows are undeniably lower.

Without Irving and Love, maybe the Cavs take the first 3 instead of going 2-1 (Also  maybe not, since 1 and 2 went to overtime). Minutes would be spread around more. Delly may not be exhausted all the time. More outside shooting goes down. You act like the Warriors were trash in Games 1-3 independently of whatever the Cavs were doing (like playing defense and slowing the pace down). I kind of think it might have been a bit influential to miss 2/5 starters and a key outside defender in Shumpert (for a game). The point overall is, we don't know but it certainly isn't crazy to imagine the Cavs having an easier go trying to take on the Warriors with Irving and Love at that point. Also remember that this was a gelling Cavs team with Irving and Love as opposed to the 2015/16 version where their roles have yet to be fully cemented post-injury.`\Seriously, Kevin, you look someone just told you your dog died instead of getting called for a foul that you obviously committed. `\Nice pass`\Meat and potatoes `\Thank you Hayward.  Your hair is beautiful btw.`\Hate to root against you guys... But we'd really like a #12 draft pick :D`\Dude went off vs Boston earlier this year in a close win. This loss may hurt Cleveland badly in the long-run if Toronto passes them. This potentially means getting a 4-5 seed is just dandy. `\That's the nicest thing anyone has said about us this season.`\screw all you hating on that harden shot. it was a clean look. that's what the man does. you hate that shot, i got a few game winners you need to hate too.`\Well this is embarrassing`\Ty Lawson is pleased.`\As is tradition`\They're somewhat known for hot chicken, and very known for reminding every other city that they're Nashville.`\Welp just made the least of any opportunity to pull away so far.

JV 1st in help defense per 100 chance
BB 3rd in help defense per 100 chance

The difference is not significant on help defense. So your perspective doesn't add up, meaning you have to look at game tape.

The open threes have less to do with helping on dribble penetration. That situation is isolated on the defense and this game in particular, was all about energy. They got a wake up call and picked it up.

Beverly, Harden and Brewer don't shoot 8-11 because a front court player provides help defense. Same thing happened last game with Brewer, these guys know the Raptors game plan and how we limit 3 P FGA but give up a high percentage, especially DD, and they are trying to expose it. It's not about help defense, it's not a front court problem lol.`\Grace v. Savagery`\How loud was that music?

Edit: On second thought, I don't even give a fuck if Capela's gone. He can't shoot free throws. I'd happily trade him for like, idk, MKG? Idk if he's worth MKG. Idk if MKG's worth Capela. But I'd trade him for that. Then we can just try for Whiteside or something.

Most teams likely don't have much of a scouting report on him and aren't really drawing up defensive sets to stop him. Ross has been in the league 3 years and is the primary offensive force off the bench. Much different situations. `\Does anyone pay Dwight the max this offseason ?`\Agreed. Maybe it is rookie enthusiasm, maybe it is sustainable. Who knows. Ross was viewed as a solid defender once also.  It's not fair to say Powell is going to take over Ross' role next year after 40 games.`\On second thought...`\Fuck Patrick Beverly and fuck these garbage ass refs.`\that was NOT a foul on harden...`\I'm happy that we can make all these team's days.

I will admit the refs were calling everything in the favor of the jazz in the late in the 4th, which kind of shows how the refs can really dominate the game. `\I've been ready for months.`\The Rockets thrive in chaos Iol`\Like in a dark alley or scoring too many points?`\That's true, can't argue with that`\how about you improve j lins shot then send him back to us`\he was great at vcu.`\Relatively comfortable with the lead, but haven't put them away yet. So, pretty par for the course. Beverley is having a great game. `\I'd guess benched. He was abonimable the last few games.

`\Steph curry is the American Joe Ingles man.`\Woooo`\Is this Hornet announcer for real? About Harden: "it's debateable if he's in shape now." Later, she said about his game, "there's a difference between playing hard for thirty minutes on both sides of the floor and playing thirty minutes spotting up and shooting free throws." What's with the salt? `\And Jarrell Martin.`\Because he's not playing`\Having watched the Rockets for a long time, I don't think Les Alexander is going to be alright with the team just "blowing it up" for the sake of.  If we can't land a big free agent, we pretty much will sit tight with the guys we have hoping to grab a mid-season trade.  That said, it's not looking good.  We're competing with a lot of teams who have cap space, and our current performance isn't really good enough to attract players on basketball merits alone.  Here's my rundown for who stays and who goes:

**Aren't going anywhere:**

**Harden** - Duh.

**Capela** - He's a good young center and is developing quickly.  He makes almost no money, is signed to a four-year contract, and unless he's a part of a big FA sign-and-trade, he's a Rocket next year.

**Probably aren't going anywhere:**

**Ariza**: - He is underpaid, and unless someone sends us back a lot, he's almost untradeable making $8 million/year for another two seasons.

**Almost certainly gone:**

**Howard** - He's going to command a lot of money from a better team, and neither do the Rockets want to pay him what he's worth, nor does he want to be a Rocket.  I like him.  He's gone.

**Probably gone:**

**Motiejunas** - This is speculation, but I think he'll play well enough over the next few weeks to be offered a contract that the Rockets can't sign right away.  Similar to what happened with Parsons, I think the Rockets will be waiting on a big name FA to make up their mind, and in the process will lose D-Mo.

**Trade pieces**

**Beverley/Brewer**- On their own these guys aren't good enough for other teams to be interested in, but they're capable role players who make enough money to be filler contracts in bigger trades.

**Terrance Jones** - Jones is gone no matter what, he's been playing too badly for the Rockets to pin any hopes to, and I think other teams know this.  If he's traded, he's going as part of a bigger package, perhaps a sign-and-trade with one of the Rockets more attractive trade pieces like Ariza.

Basically, it's not looking great.  Our most attractive trade pieces have lost their luster (D-Mo, Jones) or are free agents (Howard), or we don't want to trade (Ariza).  This offseason, lots of teams will have cap room, and lots of teams have had better seasons than us.  Let's hope Morey works his magic, but right not I'm not super optimistic.
`\No`\what just happened`\LeBron to banana boat confirmed. ^(/s)`\What the heck Dwight `\Yea he hustles `\Lol Drake left`\Beas is so smooth and fluid for such a big guy.`\And here I thought he was just a flopping bitch with an ugly, lazy game. My bad. `\happy cakeday!`\Who's ready for the Hayward disappearing act? `\Mack has been a goddamn revelation `\He does not do well when being pressured, and that's precisely what Beverley does well`\He missed 05 you're right and stop it those Nash teams were a lot better and he had nobody around him. Lol you're blaming Kobe for these past years? He tore his achilles's dude. Hasn't been the same since. Oh and you're right Lakers did get swept in 11 after going to the finals 3 straight years in a row.`\If we could just hit like 35% of our 3s... We would have like 10 more wins I bet... So annoying... Shooting droughts are too common with this team`\WHAT A FUCKING BLOCK
`\Sometimes the last 2 minutes is just fucking torture to watch`\Calm down.

Jazz will go 0-4 in their next 4, little buckaroo. `\It takes you 18 minutes to clean up?`\I hope the cavs appreciate tonight!  Rare when /r/nba gets behind you guys`\no this is what they do, same thing happened against the pacers. The other teams have normal regular subs, but harden plays the whole second half. So he goes against the B squad and they catch up but then they all too tired to put it away. `\You want to know something funny? Cory Joseph is playing better than Patty Mills.

Patty Mills is just a better shooter and more often.`\Thank you!`\> stop with the dumb traps

muahahahahahahaha! sure jb is going to get right on that :/

dmo really does seem to have lost any short burst speed/reaction he had last year. hopefully he's still getting game legs under him and not another tjones situation.`\i feel good when neto shoots it. not "lyles good," but definitely pretty good`\i dont think curry has any time for anything more than a running pull-up two from like 20 feet.

and i DEFINITELY think a pull up 35 footer is a better look for curry than a running pullup probably into traffic`\Harden racking up assists`\We haven't even won a playoff series in how long? Pretty sure most of this fanbase isn't thinking of a championship this year, lol.`\Durant will retire here lol `\think we'd have a good shot vs okc but that 6 seed is looking less plausible by the day`\I think he was referring to the way he circled around under the rim the way Gretzky circled around the back of the goal, not saying Ricky is the Wayne Gretzky of the NBA lol`\warriors got beat by the lakers. losses happen. get over it`\Oh Lance with 14pts`\5 seconds baybay`\> harden can't play d

> 8 steals, fuck the haters`\Calm down`\Rockets are worthless`\How the fuck can you be right under the basket and completely miss the rim? Damnit TT...`\Sad that Capela should probably be taking notes on how to take a FT from Dwight...`\Kevin Hart hit 8 out of 24.`\do you need glasses`\"again"

last time he was complaining about the push too.  I knew this shit would happen. `\I hate that raptors fan`\We didn't run anything for JV in the 4th.`\Lance has been playing really well with the Grizzlies. He was out tonight, though. `\He got hit on the arm, why does it even matter where he was looking...`\...ouch. `\CHOKE CITY!`\Oh that's probably why they lost then. No lance to make me dance `\This is why you don't sleep on the Rockets in the 2nd half. `\He reminds me of a black Doug Stamper.`\Horrendous double team lol. Great execution by HOU.`\Yeah, if we just had KG instead of Harden we definitely would've beaten one of the best teams of all time last year`\YEEAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHH YES YES YESYESYEYSEYSYEYSEYSEY

FUKC YES`\Marvin getting a max contract`\How many Harden turnovers can you credit to his teammate having awful hands? I swear alot of these turnovers simply bounce off his teammates hands. `\I was going to say "literally" but then I realized that most of these dudes would not be D-league all stars.`\I can tell you didn't watch the game if you're blaming JV.`\Both teams combined for 69 at the half.

I'm fine with this loss to be honest. Jazz need every win they can have to get to the playoffs, and we frankly don't need to win anymore because the more we win, the more chances Smitch comes back. Good game, Jazz.`\Fuck!!`\He wasn't even matched up with him at the start where most of his points came from`\Stick-em`\fkkkk that was a block but monroe fouled him`\Clip your damn finger nails Boston`\It's a new defensive strategy `\Move over Country Mac, Shelvin Mack is best Mac. `\Flop or foul? Seems Kyle exaggerated ahahah. `\His team will win a championship before your team lol.`\We need a sidebar pick of the sideline felx`\Damn wonder what RJ and Love were sayin`\i dont find either dirty `\Holy shit Kyrie got a foul call.`\I feel so bad for Memphis. So many injuries.`\Daaaaaamn Trey Burke is not happy`\To be expected man, they got alone GREAT at Butler.`\I guess I'll keep watching because, well, who needs sanity anyways?`\Oh yeah shit forgot about him.  He usually starts but doesn't play very much after the first rotation, has made a few impressive plays.  I wouldn't say he's core to the team at the moment but in the future he probably will be a significant player.`\Usually I wouldn't feel bad if a superstar beats us in the 4th but we've been giving up huge leads all season. It's so damn frustrating. Just wish we had a good coach. `\Who is she? I'm used to incredible homer announcers with Houston, but she was just bad.`\Fuck you Beverley... `\You idiots`\Out drinking with my wife (Mavs fan) and my good buddy (Mavs fan) and I'm very happy right now.`\ZBo for mayor`\turrible, just turrible`\Corey Brewer is no Matt Barnes, I think that goes without saying`\41-29 third seed time is good right now`\Hahahah oh the irony`\If we win the ship il get a rockets tatt with his name in it`\I'll donate some socks to you.`\I think I like these bucks announcers more than the rockets' ones.`\So Houston is the best team in the nba `\Matt Barnes is playing PG for Grizzlies and Pelicans can't even beat that. jesus they suck..`\Giannis is gonna hurt himself.`\Horrible technical foul call.`\Tanking out of the playoffs to avoid bad matchups in the playoffs.`\what the fuck`\We're so cold `\i mean, [hes still by far the worst defensive center in the league](http://espn.go.com/nba/statistics/rpm/_/page/2/sort/DRPM/position/9)

and he plays 20 minutes a game, the least amount since his sophmore year.

so yeah im glad you like him. you should because yall made him rich as fuck. `\You cant blame the refs for a loss today, but I can understand the frustration of not getting calls here. It's not without reason.`\Sun Tzu once wrote, "The greatest victory is that which requires no battle".

I hope they resign him. `\Would it kill the Jazz to put their two best players in a high pick and roll? For some reason that play isn't in the playbook.`\There sure a whole lot of NBA fans invested in the Rockets keeping their first-round draft pick.

Just play Capella. `\Is everyone excited for another free throw shooting competition!`\It's not really about expectations for me. I actually think being just on the cusp of the playoffs rubs even more salt in our wounds. We've had four of our top six players have major injuries, and we've lost so many close games. The whole point of this year was to develop the young guys and build synergy, but the injuries shut that down and it shows on the court.

I guess you could say that our record in spite of all of this is promising for the future, but it's all just potential. The whole year has been one giant tease for me.`\Game. Blouses. Based Harden giving us that daddy dick

And Lebron has passed that point `\Anderson?`\It wasn't THAT bad...But yeah, I've heard better`\Why is Howard complaining about that foul when he got all arm`\This really is a rare example where complaining about injuries is a 100% legitimate excuse IMO.  There's just no way this team could compete tonight.

Hoods out for the game.  Biyombo looked shook but ok but I think its precautions. Bebe came in and made a few mistakes but had a few good plays including an amazing out of bound save to PPat. `\LMFAO all of a sudden a 3 point game.`\From lack of trying, I think it was game plan to let him shoot and show he can make it. `\That's why JVG is the goat`\Hard to see what any of that has to do with athleticism. It just means he moves less on both ends. A lot of that has to do with the scheme. JB likes to switch a lot which means less movement. They also stick Harden on the weak side corner where there isnt' much action outside of hedging into the paint and covering the pass off a trap.  The half court offense usually goes later in the clock and when you run iso, 1-2 2-5 PnR, post ups  or he goes off ball in the corner for a DHO he's not moving very fast for most of the possession. Just because your average speed is low doesnt' mean you're not athletic, Harden attacks in bursts with quickness, speed and strength, that's what makes him so effective.`\They combine for 19 shots because Lowry shot 9 times and Derozan shot 10 times`\lmao, click on the bulls subreddit link in the header`\Yup. we're "woofing" not howling today.`\whats a pg`\You still have hockey though right?`\Still no J-Smoove.

They'll bitch about tonight being an unfair loss because of a "bad" call in Hayward's favor but do you think they'd be willing to give up the hundreds of points Harden has contributed to the franchise from questionable calls that put him at the FT line?  I doubt it.`\That ref

Much more obvious at the beginning of the year, and last year, but not so much during our run.

Horrible horrible game.`\man dwight needs to stop bringing the ball now, he gets stripped way too much`\Why dont we do Hack a Howard`\Well we hate Dallas more than you if that means something `\The only PF who could have guarded Brewer is just getting back to practice shape.`\lol, we need to chill!  If you're just talking about this particular game then we cannot really say.  Griz are missing their entire rotation, practically.

Overall, I would say we are returning to form but still have some mountains to climb.  Over the past few weeks, we had great wins against the Blazers, Raptors and Celtics but still some stinkers, as well.  This team needs to show real consistency, not just over a 3 to 4 game stretch.

Let's talk after we play the Clippers, Thunder and others in a couple weeks.`\Rockets fans would rather see Utah in it`\I'm actually surprised they/McDonalds/Wendys don't already have them. I mean hotdogs keep a lot better than hamburger, cook quicker, and as long as they are warm all the way through are hard to fuck up.`\marcus smart the tank commander`\Wow`\I would love to have him right now. We could build around him and Lance.`\If only the Mavs lost today this would have been especially interesting.`\John wall too. But D-Rose is still up there`\I'm 28.. So maybe this is just me not being "with it"..... But the way Westbrook dresses....

Could have sworn it ended at half time. `\That's the same as the game the rockets had against the pelicans recently `\This game is shambolic`\LEAGUE FUCKED`\JET, at least try to rebound...`\He's our best player off the bench dude chill`\Patrick outside of that clutch 3, you were pretty trash.

They know that are going to be double teamed every possession, so instead of taking contested shots they are passing.`\15-0 run for the Raps, the BYOMBO effect, it all starts with Defense!!!`\The defense looks much tighter with Beasley on the floor. He looks hungry. `\Ingles dunks?  And runs?`\Smart to put Ariza on AD and DMo on Dante. IIRC Ariza has done a very good job on him in the past`\hes fine omg dont overreact`\Rockets are all about sharing that ball`\I think it's time we put DeRozan on Harden. He did a very good job on him last game. `\This is true - he is damn good at taking charges.`\I'd like to point out that Golden State got blown out by the Lakers today... shit happens. We're not suddenly an awful team because we had one fourth quarter meltdown in one game.`\YOU CAN'T SAY THAT HERE`\Can't wait for Hardens lowlights.`\tbh im not really sure why i dislike him. i just do`\like you are 3 inches below the rim standing flat footed bruh`\Death, taxes, and Beas from midrange.`\Put small lineup back in `\lets go`\I don't know if I want to play the clips or thunder in the 2nd round. I think it is pretty irrelevant for the Spurs sake........ Both would give Spurs a good run.

However, who would give golden state a better series ?`\That's the main way we create space, with weaves at the start of our sets.`\His shooting has improved dramatically as of late`\Beasley is ballin`\One of these days we'll hold an opponent under 100...

...BUT IT IS NOT THIS DAY!`\Yep. And Harden actually endorses it. I felt betrayed.`\Hopefully the Wolves won't be so worn out from last night. `\nah, that's the pre-party. the real celebration is when he and harden pick kd up from the airport and hit the h-town clubs.`\Jaeger looks like he's been downing Jaegers`\:(`\The roster has the same main players as last year that you thought was good enough to win it all but now they aren't good enough for LeBron? That doesn't seem like an overreaction?`\I wonder if people are going to say he's putting up "empty stats". His team's been mostly healthy, and they're under .500.`\Seriously, how many average fans could name any basketball player that doesn't play in the NBA (excluding NCAA), let alone someone in the discussion for 'best' player? Michael Beasley is the only one that comes to mind but obviously that's not the case anymore nor would he ever enter the discussion despite his MVP season.`\did that lady win the $500 or not, i missed it`\We look fine, I guess. Bev's playing well, backing up his talk. D-Mo having a nice night. Harden double-double.

Late on some rotations as per usual. That could improve.`\Cavs getting hosed by refs can't let one team play physical defense and call the other team for the same fouls head snaps or not.

Also why is delly handling the ball he is getting completely outsized by harden put it in kyries hands.`\Please don't hack all game. Don't want to watch this game all spring break `\Did Casey shake Bickerstaffs hand after the game? I've him go into the tunnel rather quickly.

I wouldn't blame him if he didn't though... He did snitch on him lol`\Wow, that whole sequence of calls was pretty awful.`\im banning myself from watching NBA games for a while. its too arbitrary.`\Way to steal my karma..`\I am trying to say that (if he were ) a Ray Allen shooter or at the very least- a lethal shooter, he could then become our 3rd weapon in the big 3. `\A timeout would've really helped during this run but we only have 2 left, can't waste those`\point god`\Stuckey got Euro'd`\Yeah, especially last night where the Cavs were coming into a b2b on the road. The Jazz were on a b2b too, but our guys are definitely more acclimated to the altitude.`\Game 6`\0-9 from 3. Way to go boys! Surprisingly only down three!`\cp3 with 8 assists, oh me oh my!`\Yeah I remembered that, but I'm just a little surprised that he's not played whatsoever. Just kinda weird to me.
`\/u/BMC4 called the hack a dwight, good look`\I know for a fact that our front office is planning for a big free agent to come here during the summer. They really believe they have a chance at Durant, and will offer him a chance to play with Harden and Beasley and to pick a coach. Personally, I expect Durant to either stay with OKC or go to any team that's not the Rockets. I doubt Dwight will come back, and if he doesn't, that might be okay. We actually aren't managing to win more games with him. He's a great player and great to Houston, but I just don't see him coming back. Other than that, I don't know. I think Smith and Terry and Jones will be gone. Terry might retire. Hopefully we'll keep Bev and D-mo. Brewer will likely stay. Ariza will stay. Harden isn't going anywhere, and our owner is opposed to the idea of blowing up/tanking. As far as performance goes: This season has tested my patience and love for the team, but I think we're falling into what seems like a natural role for Houston. We suck for a while, then get pretty damn good, then start sucking again. We've only won two titles, and that was because Jordan retired. After the second Jordan era, we had T-Mac and Yao, but injuries and the Lakers prevented anything substantial. Now we have Harden, but Golden State likely won't be regressing any time soon, and I doubt Steph will retire a la Jordan. Our team, at least for me, has always felt like a niche team that needs other circumstances to align for them to have any success. `\Beverley has legitimately improved his game. also yay KJ burn! `\Lol yes Ariza can guard PFs at a high level. Ask Anthony Davis and Blake Griffin.`\we're still 30 min from tip and there's a lot of game action from non-massively disappointing teams tonight.`\OH SHIT, DMO!!!!!!
 missed the spurs game, haven't seen him back on the floor yet.

AND HE KNOCKS DOWN THE 3!!!! DMOOOOOOOOOO BACK, WEST FUCKED!!!!`\how was rodney not fouled on that drive?`\we match up and play them well. they only beat us by 4 in their house last week and we had a shot to send it to overtime. they'd be favored, but we'd have a decent chance.`\Wait is golden state / Portland really not gonna be on nba tv? And instead clippers Knicks? Whose idea was this? `\y'know, I never saw the comparison before that pic`\/r/NBA, can we please be friends`\How am I anti cavs? Am I not allowed to criticize a team that I love?`\It just seems like we have a case of diva personality clash that due to the separate play styles of the players involved is not being soothed by on-the-floor successes.

I mean I personally could not get along with a player like Dwight. Shaq missed his free throws but he was a force of nature offensively otherwise. Dwight misses free throws and you wonder why you have him on the court at all.`\You guys had Alston, Lowry, and Aaron Brooks at the same time! So much offense! `\It's okay if you make the Finals you're gonna get swept`\With how we've been playing in the 2nd half recently we could still manage to pull it off, but we really need to limit those turnovers and do *something* to stop the 3.`\Noooo we still may end up as the 7 seed (could be 8 too but less likely) and I want no part of Lebron in the playoffs to disappoint a fun season... *Again*`\Could anyone read Rose's lips? Looked like he said "You got no handles" to Beverley after he stole it`\How many of Lin's points are off FTs? I feel like it's gotta be close to half. `\Better than 6 though.`\You mean us? `\The next game, actually`\The sunglasses off the S are really a great touch. It's forgettable enough so that when you see it again it's just, wow. `\You gon' lurn today!`\Yeah I figured that was common knowledge at this point.

He would be an all star in any other media market`\As much as I hate the Clippers, I'd like to see Redick shoot as much as Curry. `\BEASLEY ON FIRE`\Wiggins rebounding hasn't gone up, but his passing has been worlds better. `\LOL. Dwight just asked a guy behind the basket for his drink after the foul. Man I love Dwight, guys hilarious `\I think he got it for that little shove but still a horrible call that late in the game. `\2018-19 NBA Finals match-up?`\Yo we need a team meeting every week.`\DeMar is my star. Too bad I'm watching the Rockets broadcast and they undersold it as fuck.`\I have dreams of the Hornets being as talented as the Rockets are. How they have such an average record is beyond me.`\I'd throw in a game-winning three from Asik as well.`\digging the cavs' jersey. whole kit, really.`\Man, Howard sucks these days.`\Thomas was out of bounds what the fuck`\Shocked you didn't complain about it.

Edit : oh nvm`\Good job pacers. ;-)`\I'm totally fine with a Hayward vs DeRozan battle`\Haygod dunk!`\Gonna be a good 4th qtr`\I feel like we could get more`\wow Lebron coaching now`\You don't need to bypass swear filters man`\True I just hate to talk about refs but that is a very fair analysis.`\BR3W!`\Some losses I feel that way, some I don't. There's something really shitty about losing a 20 point lead, no matter when in the season or what the context.`\The East isn't really a joke anymore.`\I call tails!`\I'm a Cav fan bruh..`\19 minutes, 2 points, 4 rebounds, 4 fouls. Not a good day for Dwight.`\*butthole clenches*

lets go jazz`\that kd commercial was actually kinda funny`\What's our record against the West? It must be really good.`\Thats tough man`\Feel bad for Cleveland sports fans. Their teams are all perpetually hopeless`\Jrue needs to start. AD and him play so well together.`\Seems like they're pissed at everyone else`\That's a T?`\I wonder if he will actually get in trouble for that?`\Well for starters DMO started talking shit to the other team. They had to separate him. Thats what really caught my eye. I didn't think that DMO had it in him.

Also everybody was acting like they were the shit. No humbleness from us. Even if it is the bench, were playing against a D league team.`\There's a difference between creating/finding contact and jumping backwards with a spin when there pretty much is none`\Don't worry about my rocket bro :)

Smart's a clever defender with an extremely athletic game while he's developing a good offense and hes only 22! he's a great prospect and well best case turns into Westbrook and worst case turns into a bigger PatBev type of pesky defender but with more athleticism.

Also man Harden is like the most vilified active player on here so i get were you're coming from with the /r/NBA hate.`\Good shit by Kyrie for attacking a different PnR instead of the one with Capela cuz Capela gonna get his ass eventually`\Fuck all these teams that play amazing against the Jazz and then have uncharacteristic melt downs against the Rockets.`\Yeah it's crazy, but think, we probably would've never heard of Anta without Tony Parker. Now they have several more nba players and brand recognition in the US and France which probably made them a good chunk of change`\BREWER STILL LOVE YOU BUD WOOOHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHOOOOOOOOoooooooooooooooooo`\BUZZ BUZZ MOTHER FUCKERS`\I really didn't expect Sixers to be mad after losing. You would think they would be used to it by now`\Why in the fuck are they ignoring Jabari in the past 2 minutes? I dont fucking understand this fucking team at crunch team. WHY ARE THEY IGNORING THE LEADING SCORER??!!`\James Harden is the man`\Im fine with that. Everyone else was bricking. Gg Pacers yall executed we didnt down the stretch`\Gorgui is so bad with the ball`\But it tells you when the beer is cold!`\If we combine Corey Brewer on offense with Doug McDermott on defense we might have the most fidgety player in NBA history.`\Beasley can be our draymond green`\oh wow flops cant protect you from that`\And honestly Derozan is ignored soooo much. 2nd best SG in my opinion`\What's up with these calls? `\I think he turned the ball over 3 possessions in a row down the stretch.  Cringe.`\I know we are saying the same thing, but even when he shoots wide open 3's i cringe. I know its going to hit the back of the iron and bounce 20 feet in the air.`\[Not really](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/47nse1/slug/d0ebdqz)

Nothing to do with Gobert.`\GG `\And he's an absolute savage.`\Riddick Riddick`\Its when he ISOs or heaves a bullshit shot with 15-12 seconds left on the clock. Can't really blame him when he does that getting the ball with 5 seconds, that's fine.

Nah, I don't think so.`\Jabari nooooooo`\Lol that's all you talk about I think you're just butt hurt about something`\God damn what the fuck?`\Hayward disappearing act`\Oh the Jazz are playing well?!?!?

I've got some Hornets fans in here downvoting me, but they can't possibly defend that analysis of Harden's game.`\No shit we're down 3. But we're definitely choking the game away eh guys?`\I honestly don't know.  I don't hold a lot of weight in /r/NBA's opinion on anything related to the Cavs these days so I honestly can't say.  I've seen plenty of people question the moves he's made.  IMO he's been fantastic but I try to keep that to myself around here. `\And we like to come back in the 4th, should be good`\Holy shit guys there's no huge fucking ref bias against us the reffing is just straight garbage for every team.

`\Jeremy Lin on a fast break is my nightmare.`\Dwight and Capela both have shit hands. It's so frustrating. Harden can get careless sometimes, but it just adds to his and the team's turnover count when those guys can't catch a simple pass. Most times it's a four point swing.`\I feel like taking charges is Smart's biggest talent.`\"*Does it hit him?*"

Referee nods his head yes. `\Nah, Smart is better than TA at this point, and is equally good as Lebron on the perimeter. I'd argue he's better than Jimmy Butts too.

No wonder why the rest of the league hates the Rockets.  Enjoy your first round exit.

>A team constantly embarrassed by the cowboys.

The Eagles have split with the Cowboys the past few seasons, and shouldn't you be a Texans fan?  One of the only team dumb enough to pay a defensive end ~$25 mil a year?  Your best QB was Matt Schaub.  Let that sink in.

I can't be too mad though, they made the playoffs last year and managed to get walloped by Andy Reid, who still can't figure out how to manage an NFL clock.  What's worse is that they couldn't even score a single point in that game.  I feel ya though.  Being a Sixers fan these days feels kinda like being an Astros fan for the last 10+ years before 2015.  I'm glad you guys finally got a respectable team down there, I can't wait until it all goes to shit this season and you start selling off all your pieces again. Btw, tell Ed Wade I said thanks for drafting the core of our awesome Phillies run.

Great seque, our last championship was in '08.  When was the last time a professional team in Houston won a title?  Back when OJ was running from the cops?

I genuinely like the Rockets.  I really like Morey a lot and I'm sad you guys fell off a cliff this year and Harden can't carry your team to 50+ wins.  It's gonna be sad watching Golden State sweep you in the first round.  I'll be pretty bummed.  Maybe you'll get a game out of it, but most likely, you'll be just another loser sports city like us, only with fewer zoning laws.`\Good 1st `\As soon as JV goes out, we go on a 8-0 run. No coincidence`\Neat-O`\Not a good start `\38`\From what we saw in Houston, it's a valid criticism.  He really only got PT for us out of desperation.

We can't even say "fuck it" and put the bench in, because that's the entirety of our team.

Great game Houston. Harden with those sticky fingers. Don't quite know how the Jazz pulled this off but I'm not complaining. Maybe that back-to-back had its effect there down the stretch like our layoff did at the beginning of the game.

On to OKC! `\Wow how does Moore go basket to basket`\lol calm down.`\Its how fouls work`\Well, I'm admittedly a LeBron fan second to being a Blazer fan.

Obviously he's not going to cover Beas that well defensively. His rim protection has been solid not to mention the few steals he's had.

Poor dude was just hired earlier today.`\Wow I was there too`\I understand why these young guys do it.....but I'd like to think of I were in that position I'd choose staying with the warriors. You still get paid millions, you're with the group of friends toyve been with for a couple years becoming very close. The entire state loves you, and you have the best shot at winning the greatest award in your profession. But then ego comes into it I guess. Who knows what Harden would be now had he stayed with OKC. He most likely would not have been close to being runner up for the MVP.`\He'll love Wisconsin!`\Those passes were niceeeeeee`\Good deal.

Because it certainly isn't shooting, passing, or defense`\Especially if they keep doubling Harden on those post-ups`\There's no player I want more as Rocket than Pau Gasol.`\Something one commentator said about one play is not really an event of the game. Especially one that comes down to the wire after one team blows an 18 point lead `\oh no

bring back coach wake him up from his nap`\It already has `\How about the defensive stats`\Uh oh `\MARVELOUS`\This is the game where mickey earns regular minutes.`\they're drunk`\Haha anyone see LaVine giving KAT a creepy staring smile untill Towns noticed and fled to another seat?`\I'm just here for Beas`\This is the time I turn on the Spurs game and pretend there's some "Texas brotherhood" thing that exists`\WHO FOR 3MO?`\Do the rockets like harden as a teammate?`\that doesn't mean he's fun to watch though`\so hood`\TT has been nice at the line tonight`\bah gawd dwight`\Avery Bradley most likely. Beastly defender.`\we not looking good...`\It's like LeBron is on the court with them. They're playing like he's there. Smooth, fast, efficient. LeBron has definitely made an impression on this team`\Now that T was a joke, he wasn't even saying anything and walked away from him.`\Fuuuuuuuuu...`\Why isn't KJ in this game?`\Michael Beasley is here to set the world on fire`\Rod Hood da clutchest. How in the world did we let Harden get a clean look at the end though?`\2 Trey 16`\Timmy!`\They should let people taunt a little bit at least`\Well good to know Stepheson can play well against other D-leaguers...`\The 420?`\But is it a bananable offense?`\That last possession gave me cancer`\We need to call the timeout`\Neto's gotta make a layup someday.`\"rough up the dribbler" is a funny way of saying "tear his knee in half"`\idk.  Kind of a hard foul by Howard there...`\Somebody's gotta create a Mute Hubie app.`\Houston knows how to fucking entertain their fans. Holy shit that place looks so fun`\I fucking love Ricky Rubio`\The renovation isn't for the regular fans. It's about the people who buy advertising and corporate suites. `\I feel like he is constantly working on new moves and just waits until he's comfortable enough to pull them out in games. `\Sorry sir won't happen again sir

FUCK THE ROCKETS`\Probably a flagrant.`\Lately Lowry's drives to the rim have been so dominate. He really get's what we wants. Soft release. So Quick/Skinny Lowry. Maybe I am reaching but this Reminds me of Derrick Rose. `\Holy shit. What the hell happened?`\:(`\That is not a flagrant! Completely unintentional hit on Plumlee's head.`\DAMN IT RUDY CATCH THE BALL`\I just want this new PG to come in and show off that 3 pt shot`\horford take a set shot 3? weird looking.`\Bottom? We are .5 game from the 8th seed.`\BLAZE ONE FOR BEAS`\instantly injured his back like 3 games and no playing time into the season`\well said!`\Have Asik and CP3 ever been on the floor at the same time?`\I mean, you're not wrong, I don't get the downvotes. Anyone who watched the game could see Kyrie had a ton of open looks but shot like shit tonight. Delly, JR, Jefferson all missed easy shots too. It wasn't cuz Lue is retarded, shots just didn't fall. `\More Lyles, please.`\Yup, 21 I think, but that's still really young and he wasn't shooting as bad when he came in the league, his shot isn't broken. I'm not a professional, but I love his work ethic and I see him improving a lot over the next few seasons. I'm sure FT% will be a priority for him once he gets more stable around the basket and more muscle`\I hope the Grizzlies are secretly Sayians and after every injury and beating they take and survive from, they come back stronger.`\do you mean "on a tear"?`\Agreed. Lots of people thought McHale was trash because of his X's and O's (myself included), but some of the lineups JB puts out there really make me wonder if he's legitimately retarded.

At least Mac was more aware of his players' skill sets and which lineups worked together.`\I fucking love Beasley`\We have been struggling to win the last week or so.  `\AAAAAYYYYYNNNNNNNDDDDD WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHNNNNNNN`\That last Portland game the rockets were pretty clutch`\JoJo's Bizarre Adventure`\THANK YOU! My sentiments exactly. Basically the Thunder Last year without westbrook. No reason we should be this happy.`\I'm pretty sure he's talking about the Raptors...`\ZBo is going to work on Gobert`\man, if you're going to keep calling this weak shit you need to do it both ways.`\Going in the opposite direction now lmao. I love it. `\T-Jones didn't touch the floor and we won, despite going 3/34 from 3. Just sayin'.`\Shit`\Mother fucker, Gordon's on my fan duel team as one of my sleepers $@%!

How bad is it? Think he'll come back in?`\So we don't have 2nd half struggles. Just third quarter struggles.`\Thats just shitty`\Man, it'd be nice if we could just unleash a barrage of threes to end the game like some teams out west.`\That loss was all on Brett Brown. 105-103 game when he decides to fucking put Grant on Howard. It ruined our rotations on defense because Grant isn't strong enough and we couldn't run a set on offense. Four possessions later, it's 112-103 with less than two minutes and the game's over.`\okay i just checked the score, never mind`\Was hoping we might catch a break with PJ.

Does not seem to be the case.`\A 30 point lead is a 30 point lead in the NBA which is impressive.

I don't remember anyone discounting a 30 point win over us when we were missing Dwight, Bev, D-Mo, etc.`\Im just getting into nba i used to go to my HS games anything i should loom for tonight?`\Mavs, Blazers and Utah fans lurking in the gamethread, lacking balls to talk trash before the game is decided, weak guys, very weak.`\WHAT THE FUCK ?`\You jinxed it`\We should use our point guard.`\Cavs fans always crying even though we're good`\I'm almost sad that's the play they drew up.`\no, he means that he spent his childhood in the water. Very odd, I know. `\BALL DON'T LIE`\FUCK THE ROCKETS`\I don't `\lol thanks buddy. it felt weird when i blew it out and it was a loogie of mustard. don't think any went really high up, although I don't remember holding back. `\that was a necessary review`\yeah I'm beginning to think that the long season is getting to him. He's been a little nonexistant lately. When Olynyk comes back hopefully we rest him a lot more`\Just the way coach drew it up`\pathetic defense, no excuses, well deserved l`\I didn't know Shelvin Mack played for the Raptors`\Too much stickum`\C'mon, Ryno. Stop trying to post Harden.`\They tried that, and they were pretty much the worst uniforms in the history of pro sports`\I'm cool with whatever as long as it goes both ways`\Why is Jrue untouchable?`\make me`\Amen`\[So something a little like ~~to~~ this?](http://i.imgur.com/jrTZ56W.png) but with houston instead of anchorage obviously`\You forgot the No Homo part.

`\Love you Pacers <3`\Sup blind guy`\fuck it. just hack DJ now`\Literally every time the Raptors get within 2 games of the Cavs they lose. I'm not too concerned about them catching us with 8 games left`\We beat the Blazers without Lillard

And we only lost by three to the Warriors the first time.`\holy shit`\I feel bad for the guy. Dude has so many trolls it's not even funny. He replies to like every single one too.`\If I was a head coach and LeBron wanted to tell me his ideas on how to play basketball I would let him.`\"Fouled him with the Beard, I think"`\Cut the lead by four whole points, only down by 16 now. Maybe we should just trade him`\REF DOWN< I REPEAT, REF DOWN`\Wiggins wishes he was hardens level.

4 TOs smh, Harden had 9`\best story ive ever heard`\our perimeter defense is lost. AGAIN`\Is stickum illegal in the NBA?`\Midget basketball, if you will. `\I think the issue there is that DeRozan can't shoot from 3 so if he doesn't have the ball down the stretch it clogs their spacing. At the end of the day, the man can fucking ball. You could do a lot worse than Demar DeRozan down the stretch.`\And to think we wanted Jabari Parker instead.`\Thanks for holding up your end of the bargain, Utah! `\[Just looked at the score for the first time](http://giphy.com/gifs/cat-goodbye-done-iPiUxztIL4Sl2)`\13`\Yeah sitting both Kyrie and Love in the 4th was a turrible idea. Coach Lue really screwed up tonight. Plus trying to play Kyrie off-ball when you are unable to feed him or Love the ball was also stupid.

But credit to Houston they played incredible D in the 4th. Beverley / Beasly / Ariza played superb D and Harden is a boss.`\TRoss out tonight, everyone's just taking turns having minor injuries `\LOL THEY HACKING`\March is National Kemba Month`\Yes, but considering Houston won by 49 you would think the entire bench would get *some* minutes`\Would you guys have Kemba breaking into the top 20 players?`\swagged out`\I hope the rockets give Dwight the max.... Epic meltdown .`\AD has gigantic lips.  I wonder how many stitches it took to close it.`\jesus christ beasley`\damn you're late now we don't get the flashy boxscore cause some guy alrdy made a post game`\So he banged his heads on Biyombo?`\Nothing you could do about it.`\good one.`\what a goober`\unless we get 5/6 seed. 0 confidence`\Lol feels like the Bucks have 3 SF on the floor at all times. Crazy length.`\Our sound system is sack, this is weird as fuck`\Hubie always ends up rooting for a team during s broadcast it seems. Pretty annoying. `\JAMES JOHNSON REDICK `\Powell! You were a steal!`\ight cleveland hit a shot things could get interesting `\they might as well, the pick is still salvageable.`\J3TLIF3`\Except he rotated down... Would you have him jump as high as DeAndre and prevent the lob?`\Absolutely not. `\Not at all. They are gone. James Harden, Swaggy P runnin up the budget.`\because god forbid james went at him in the backcourt and made him pick up the ball. fucking stupid.`\AD was 3-17 in the first half, now 3-4 in the 3rd quarter`\A lot, at least one per game`\Statistically ? Or realistically. I will agree on one. `\True. For me personally, I don't even give a shit about playoffs after tonight. I'd rather keep the pick and get JB the fuck out of Houston immediately than see us get ass-raped by Golden State or San Antonio, because we sure as shit ain't getting that 6 seed.`\Fuck /u/Diboeticpuppy`\Most means majority and you know damn well that is not true.  Stop with the self deprecation.  `\Props to the Houston announcers for unironically whining about someone flopping against Harden.  Your own medicine must really taste icky.`\BEASLEY DOES IT ALL LOOOOOOL`\Ravioli, ravioli, what's in the Lebronioli `\ryan gonna punch a ref before the night is done. 2 travels and double dribble will do that.`\Stepheson sucks, where is former Grizzlies summer league legend Jack Cooley when we need him?`\and you wouldn't?`\Thanks Houston `\Yea like you said, if you make the 6th seed. Idk if that can still happen though.`\Bro, weren't you just in our sub today talking about "upvote every time"`\Which announcers are better? Hou or Cle?`\Am I the only one that hopes Lance plays?`\people shit on hayward but dude is playing on a shitty ankle, im amazed he can still ball so hard after that injury, hopefully playing so much doesnt make his injury worse`\You can say they choked all you want, Rockets earned that.`\He was a warrior favorite as was dunleavy. Treat him well.`\MICHAEL FUCKING BEASLEY. GODDAMN, SON.`\WHAT A FUCKING FLOP MAN`\Iso`\Brew already exceeding his past 10 game ppg average `\Why is the goddamn NBA so soft `\Sickening man. Fucking pathetic `\That's not really fair considering how much PT he got last year imo. I think he has improved his game a lot. He's still raw, but not nearly as raw as he was last year or even in the start of this year. `\And Spurs beat the Warriors , so you know what means. 2016 Rockets greatest sporting club of all time.`\More so than your team.`\The Jazz are contractually required by the NBA to blow all double-digit leads. `\Was that an accident? `\There you go big fella `\If we would have lost this big, it would have been posted way before 4th quarter even ended`\Cynical form of basketball? What?`\I switched to the Badgers game but hopefully Giannis gets a double double at least (and a Bucks win too...sure).`\Christ... We have literally 0 reason to put Mickey back in this game. I'm going to be devastated if he doesn't come back in. `\I love Paul Pierce but he did not carry us`\DAAAAAAMN`\So this game is gonna be like 150-148 because fuck defense `\This is bullshit.`\pic`\To be fair, Jason Terry was the closest defender, while Dwight was running back. `\Yes the heat were better at putting the basketball in the net. that's what he's saying`\Fuck off. Enjoy a 1st rd exit again`\MICKEY UNLEASHED!!`\No, Howard sucks TOday.`\Capela can have my babies`\Would rather have been blown out from the start then to lose like that. Fucking waste. No team gives up as many double digit leads as we do. Raps just don't know what to do when the other team goes on a run, that falls on coaching. `\its just not the same!`\Time to stir the pot`\Welcome to the official "Ricky is Sorry for the first half"-Show.`\nice play. howard left that dude wide open! `\GIANN1S`\I think you mean 7/11/18`\These refs are garbage as fk`\Rockets supporting cast are way worse then Cavs `\I tuned in at the end of halftime and saw a Bebe highlight, is Biz alright?`\Another huge missed call against the jazz in the l2m report tomorrow. `\Oh my GOD. What the actual FUCK. `\Why

Pretty sure I saw a thread a few weeks ago showing that in the NBA Referee Reports for the last 2 minutes of games, the Cavs had the 2nd most wrong decisions against them. `\GG Wolves fans. Obligatory "y'all gonna be real spooky soon," cause you are. `\it was clean`\Team is tired, GG Hornets `\Sundiata Gaines about to come off the bench?`\A good start for once!`\BEAS SIGHTING TIME TO GO UP BY 50838503057`\I think the r/nba concensus is that the Rockets announcers are some of the biggest homers in the league and they are not very analytical either`\MR. 94 GOD DAMN FEET`\Aw Brewer `\This would be a real good win for the cavs if they can win. Irving needs the confidence that he can lead a team to a win against the non elite teams in the league.`\See this is why we got to get the nba popular in the middle east so they can find some common ground in hating the rockets.  Could solve so many problems in the world!`\COOK BEASGOAT COOK!!`\Keep getting to the line Harden... Do your thing`\It's crazy because in the playoffs he truly is a different beast. I don't get it. He plays with so much more heart and aggressiveness in the playoffs. `\and today was the day jb bickerstaff turned to his bench to realize he had kj mcdaniels on his roster. and a good day it was.`\LOL this guy's the worst`\1 or 2 rockets fans you salty over/disagree with =/= all rockets fans. Just like how I don't want everyone generalizing against us Raps fans.`\He was clearly going for the ball gtfo `\What the hell happened to the wizard of bazz? The dude is reaching adriean payne levels of play in terms of contributing to the team. Just hurts.`\Oh we're back to trashing 2Pat again? `\He wasn't exactly heaving early shot clock 3s before though. He is rested now so that is good, but there are going to be a lot of possessions where nothing happens and he gets the ball with 7 seconds to shoot and it ends up being a bad shot. Sometimes a Jimmy iso is the best offense, depending on matchups and what not. He may have been taking over a little too much but I am willing to put up with a few slightly less efficient possessions. `\How long is it? I've never actually read any Sun Tzu I just happened to know that quote. But Art of War is such a huge cultural book it would seem worth reading....if it wasn't *too* long`\Don't you have someone else to be talking to right now? ):

You left us!`\Lose with some grace for fucks sake`\Why do so many people care about other people's money lol?`\Yeah of all the comebacks that really wasn't the one to use.`\is it just me or is Powell already better than tross? `\weird yahoo has a guy called Vernon macklin on the rockets bench`\jimmer `\I'm just here so I don't get fined`\LETS PLAY DEFENSE`\Yes it is. Biggest lead the Cavs have dropped all year.`\lol looks like everyone watching march madness
`\Dad dick air ball`\Anyone else think the Raps are going to go into New Orleans tomorrow with just a little bit of a chip on their shoulder?`\Cavs fucked over their fans by resting Bron at a HOME GAME for the sole reason of seeing Kyrie and the boys step up and they just didn't.

Rough night for Cleveland.`\Hairgod warming up`\Who's that scrub?`\Collided heads with Biz`\Amazing.  In a game where our bench finally adds something combines for 50 points, Harden, Ariza and Bev combine for 19. `\I know he probably felt like he was shooting too much.`\Is he out for the season?`\VAUGH FROM DEEEEEEEEEP`\Why can the Raptors not hold onto leads?`\cause it was a three sec. Brewer was wide open in the corner`\For like a couple days lol nice job`\ I had no idea that happened... Wow`\I personally much prefer the red.`\AD deserves to be, but damn the Pels are so injury prone...

DMC will prolly be considered up there when he makes the playoffs`\
Chris hadfield is Canadian...  and Houston's best rapper is riff raff`\he wanted to get the foul.`\we can have 6 TOs in a matter of minutes.`\Gobert seems to be woken up after getting postered. +-`\Omg Houston what are you doing`\Its a flagrant 1 now`\no, it's just you shouldn't be complaining`\Skyline?`\They are actually declining lol. They were the 6th seed last year.`\Beas!`\Jump step + pump fake would have given DMo the shot and 1.`\Small thing that didn't make a difference, but I'm so glad Lyles took it as far as he could instead of taking a half courter.`\Lol. Late in the 2nd quarter they couldn't stop blowing the whistle for both sides and now neither side can get a whistle.  `\Does Houston have a single C that is a decent FT shooter?`\I started this year as a Celtics fan because of Rozier but the constant lack of minutes really kills me. At least he didnt get traded. Give him some minutes! `\Nice`\I have never seen soooo many lapses in defense from Harden... Whomever he was switched on scored, Jamal, Cp3, JJ. `\And at Houston with them having a back to back after playing OKC on Tuesday, on Wednesday.`\Not sure why Ross is in the doghouse so badly. He would match up much better with this smaller Rockets line up`\Rockets looking pretty sharp early tonight. `\Pretty amazing that Favors and Rubio have been making jumpshots and yet both teams combined for less than 70 points`\K-LOW!!!!!!!!!!`\Well there you go. Thanks!`\JVG said Pau could go to San Antonio. Imagine Duncan quietly retires this summer and they pick up Pau. It makes too much sense. `\I guess sitting both Love and Irving together is not a good idea when LeBron is out.`\Players should never, ever leave their feet when Mirotic shoots. Not very high IQ plays from Beasley.`\Nevermind.

NEVER SHOOT ANOTHER 3 AGAIN, ONLY ATTACK THE RIM, PJ`\Yeah it doesn't matter but it's bullshit. `\Bev has really worked on his 3 point shot, looks so smooth. Smart to cause his defense is a little slower after his injuries`\kinda like this game thread`\Sheldon Cash`\and refs decide another game in favor of the Jazz's opponent.  It was a good season!   See ya'll next year!`\I really, really want the Warriors. I'd be very happy with any playoff experience but I think we won't win any games against the other teams but I'm mildly insane and think we'll steal one from GSW.`\I miss B-Eazy`\ariza has been fine. it's been a tough year for brew. can't even knock down the corner 3s regularly.`\Get JET out of this game`\michael beasley in charlotte this evening. i saw him once in charlotte when we were both in high school (oak hill v. providence day). ty lawson was also on that team. this was when beasley had committed to unc charlotte and there were a lot of 49er fans there supporting him. he would later de-commit and sign with k-state. lawson had a nasty dunk in that game. anyway, just thought i'd share this anecdote. big al! `\Cole is eating Dwight's cookies`\Have you just seen the way lowry got ejected lmao`\My heart can't take another loss. Fuck Chalmers. Grizz are my number two but I really hate this twerp`\Well... uh... Anyone listen to the new Violent Femmes album? What did you think of it?`\And no Kyrie... `\Ohh, didn't get it.

Talking the ball on bobble head was on right hand of a left handed person.

Was there a water incident with DM?`\Beasley helping out the Heat even when he's not here is glorious. Thank you Houston. `\oh god win or lose Harden is getting hatejerked so badly tonight`\Wait what? I didn't notice DeRozan had scored 27`\He will be back. I got banned like 6 times on here. `\I want Chris Webber every game. This dude is hilarious. `\KAT needed it for the double double.  Now he can let them go.`\I usually don't agree with Leo but he's right pound it down low with JV when they go small. Of course with Dwight in now try and get a switch.`\ITS J LIN BOBBLE HEAD NIGHT AND ITS AGAINST THE ROCKETS HE GOIN OFF`\Houston plays on Tuesday at OKC and then us in Houston on a back to back on Wednesday. We'll be waiting there for 3 days.`\MAYBE STOP SWITCHING PAT ON MILSAP?!?`\Honestly love the Clips announcers. Truly forgot how great the word "bingo!" is`\NAH, REFS, IT'S COOL. NBA PLAYERS MISS THAT SHOT ALL THE TIME. NO WAY HE WAS PUSHED.`\Nothing more irritating than losing a ball because 2 of your players run in to each other.`\Ricky finishing at the rim, is this the next stage? `\So nice to see consistent defensive effort`\Vintage`\lebron es not hapi`\They're hustling so far, which is nice`\A fucking block party in Boston`\Damn that was a weak call`\My bad, I'm salty right now`\Ryan`\https://xkcd.com/605/`\I don't think this Trevor Booker guarding Anthony Davis strategy is going to pay off for us.`\18-11`\Dumbass Dwight`\Terry man leave the guy alone`\Bev leading on players with 12 rebounds lol`\JR gonna JR`\BEVER3`\D-Mo is tall as fuck`\Michael "50% USG" Beasley`\I'd like to see him actually shoot a 3 when he's wide the fuck open. He's shown in the past he's a capable 3 point shooter`\HAIR GOD! `\Enjoy your future first round exit`\Lol that's exactly the type of draining three jet used to drop on us`\It wasn't a clear path foul until Mack jumped behind him to hug him.`\lol who the fk was that?`\lol IT going back to his college self*, fall down in the lane and look for the whistle.

I actually might make my next user name that.`\The Pacers announcers are getting salty   `\Ah gotcha. My bad`\thats not fair`\GL! One of my favorite teams in the league`\lol`\Dagger`\No one is saying the stat is wrong, just that it's not a way to measure  athleticism because of the reasons you listed.`\not often you can say that`\Pretty start.`\Draft I believe.`\so conflicted. harden's my favourite player in the league yet i obviously want the cavs to win lol`\coach mad

he gon spank his naughty players while assistant coach nods nervously`\wrong thread.`\this should be fun lol`\Bricks open 3, lets Pacers take an uncontested dunk. Fantastic.`\Haha. Zumoff toasting Harden.`\Why did he do that? He sounds like a dumbass.`\are you fucking serious`\No. He has no plays and cant sub at all`\I'm pretty sure Scola is going to single handedly win us every game here on out with his 3's.`\yeah, we still like scola and lowry`\That's dumb. If we're going solely by their Draftkings and Fanduel prices, Harden is one of the only players that consistently stay over $10,000. The others are Curry and Westbrook. Even Durant, Wall, and Davis drop down to the 9000s sometimes`\That pass shouldn't have gone to Favors, from whoever that was under the basket `\She probably just doesn't like his playing style.  A lot of people don't.  I wouldn't take it to heart she's usually pretty on-point about other things.`\It's consistent with the way they have been calling them all year.`\Lol. `\Lol thanks I don't get the down votes. I'm only saying because we have times where both Patterson and Scola go cold, it's worth a shot. Biyombo was hot on defence right now getting blocks. `\We're not. This guy is a bitter outlier. `\Probably top 3 with LeBron and Draymond`\IT DOES TO ME.

No legit it's just on NBA.coms fam tracker so I figured I'd share. Gives you a good idea of lineup strength`\get harden in`\Burn it down!`\How does it feel knowing that the losing team in that picture stepped on your team's throat two rounds earlier?`\Didn't expect them to say they're from Australia `\SOME CAND-THREED YAMS`\Ohhh...

Hey snitches get stitches. `\Lances right hand was on his arm. Other hand did a little shot right into the ribs  `\Good over all game from everyone today. Some great clutch plays down the stretch by Harden. I'm sure that wasn't the blow out they would have like after the players meeting, but it was a good tough win. `\no you shut up`\Nothing to get mad about if he didn't`\You don't choose the 8th seed, the 8th seed chooses you`\I can't really watch a lot of games since it's very late at night here where I live. I wanted to turn off the game in Indiana last Sunday in 3rd, but then they suddenly started getting points and changed their game. I said to myself "well, I guess they want to let me down 2nd time today, let's see"...`\This Hornets team seems to be very deep. Great ball movement, too.`\I think we're a better team than the Celtics, full stop. I don't think it's a matchup issue, they're just not as good as us. (Additionally, I think the East is still really weak, and their improved record against the West this season is just a fluke, freak thing.)

But that's just me...`\TREY MAMBA FUCKING LYLES`\Classic nba reffing, we need more makeup calls`\Maybe, but I think it plays into each other. `\Jason Terry is a punk bitch`\Now it's the Rockets' turn to choke.`\I don't like playing in Utah.`\jesus someone give me the clifford gif `\Lol what the `\Did Leo just reference that Drake is drinking cough syrup?`\Just tuning in, has Dominique called any dagger shots yet?`\Still is money tonight though.`\Damn, didn't realize how quick Beverly is!`\BANG BANG BEASLEY`\well they did ask clyde if he remembered a certain game of his from 1996 and he laughed and said "I can't remember anything past last week!" so what do you expect`\That "flagrant foul" and his last foul were pretty cheap fouls but Capela definitely stepped up.

In past games, if Howard fouled out or got ejected and Capela had to play, its been very on/off with him.  Nice to see him make HUGE plays tonight.`\Thank you captain obvious. `\Could hear the wetness on that Ingles 3`\[Snyder is a screening nerd.](http://bmsi.ru/doc/e3a0dd1b-aad6-4fec-96f4-fb4e8a3d4330)

Apparently one of the first things he really got into when he first arrived were the angles on the picks they were setting.`\oh fuck dude`\thx m8. I'm pulling for the Raptors to overtake the Cavs. You guys are way more fun to watch imo.`\What did they say?`\I don't know why they said that or why they would have advanced knowledge of something like that.  The injury reports I've seen say they are targeting early March for his return, which is a far cry from late October.  It would be different if the Jazz weren't targeting a playoff spot.`\MICHAEL BEASLEY WOOOOO`\The only thing Harden can do better is pass. KD is pretty clearly the better all-around player. He can play great defense lately and is a better individual scorer.

`\I thought he might cum in his pants when they called the foul on Love for pushing Hood out of bounds`\Fuck that they have to throw in J.J. Watt as well`\shit commercial

they should both get bud lite enemas`\It feels like bonus points.

Bev and Rose are having friendly trash talk and refs give them techs.. smh`\This is what happens when we only hit three 3s. `\Lol...`\i swear to god. almost every rockets game i have watched this season, they go ham in the 4th. thats how they beat raptors this season`\I Enjoyed This Basketball Game `\ohh shit, of course. in my head I was like "Chris?...noooooo"`\Vintage?`\True.  Just felt like a lot of contact there.  That's fine if they are consistent with calls.  Feels pretty average tonight.`\oh Rivers Jr is killing it!! ...the lead that is!`\damn hes gonna play 44 and still lose lol. `\Harden with the nice sell`\almost done with the first quarter and we have more turnovers than assists. rockets basketball!`\Here's a hint Rockets aren't that great if Harden is having a relative Off night. `\>Kit

Euro confirmed `\Ehhh, Dwight was the man tonight.`\WE BEEN PLAYING POSSUM WITH KJ. LEAGUE AIN'T READY.`\So it's safe to say that the Rockets were better than the Clippers.`\what is shooting?`\He's bringing the energy today. I even saw him jump to contest a shot!`\We have been so bad in the first quarter.  Getting really old.`\I missed this team! `\if Al can regain 3/4 of his Bobcats form its almost unfair for us to be bringing him off the bench. `\Yeah, that might be going on.`\Refs a bitch. `\honestly that isn't a bad strategy`\Rockets gameplan is like mine in 2k. Just let Harden sprint in the paint. `\These refs are whistling everything. Except the take foul that Pat put on Plumlee. They're just bad.`\Swat`\This is how you throw away a game. Congrats DD`\Gonna be an interesting reffing report for this game`\Because a team with a top 8 record in their conference doesn't deserve to be in the playoffs.

That's how this works, right?`\See you boys on the front page:(`\That was a beautiful pick and roll by Hayward and Favors. `\KYRIE`\And then you remember hes our only source of paint protection and a top rebounder`\so jealous about M. Beasley.

just diamond in rough from the CBA`\i posted before the game family`\If JB's still around, we'll just switch and put Ryan on an island. Harden's PnR defense, in our scheme at least, is actually decent. He's good down low.`\One of the Boston Announcers just said something like this about Beasley.  "He must have got some special shots or something to be let back into the country..."`\Blazers losing by 4 with 30ish seconds`\Hayward gonna explode`\lol jb putting brewer at the 4 again...`\Well then`\Why are we even watching this hahaha.`\That's just stupid Bis`\ we are choke city every year and specially when it matters`\I stopped asking that question after the Houston game`\Ahh man Kyle`\Get over it.`\Lebron is not impressed.`\Lol yeah buy that's the key of every game every night since the beginning of time. `\Eh, I wouldn't be too surprised if he is.  Might as well let him sit the rest of the year while rehabbing and let him work during the offseason and start fresh next year.  `\they don't want harden to hurt 'em

major key`\If it was definitely taunting, it would have been called. Taunting is looking down at the guy that you put on the ground. Jae ran into a guy on a drive. He flexed to the crowd. Not at the guy on the ground. Not toward anybody connected to the Jazz. That isn't taunting my friend. `\He was a draft pick from the Barngani deal I believe. Absolute Steal. `\This...this is a troll post...right?`\No you're fine -- he's stuck on his phone so he couldn't post it very quickly and came in a bit after you.  Having the box score in the body of the post is nice but he wouldn't have been able to put that in immediately anyway.`\man I'm still kinda mad Masai chose Bruno over Rodney hood... imagine our bench having Rodney good and bobby portis? we'd win one game against the warriors in the finals`\Lol Worrel has called sefolasha "bazemore" the entire game`\Saw the score, meant how are we playing?`\Dad dick favs putting in work. `\the dudes a dirty player`\Rockets to Seattle confirmed.`\Do y'all have Josh Smith again? Win or lose, I think we are all owed the experience of Lance and Josh playing together that the Clippers didn't give us.`\Now that's the Brewer I know and love.`\Did you misspell "defense"... Lol Shump isn't exactly an offensive powerhouse. And the last thing you guys need is more defense!! I would feel sorry for all of the west backcourts haha`\At least Portland is getting thumped. Half a game from the 6th seed isn't bad. Thunder are good but still preferable to Spurs or warriors who would sweep us`\Neto is the best 3 point shooter in the league`\BLACK NOT AMERICAN CENTERS`\Raja was a total party pooper though. Chris Johnson seems to be fully aware of his role on the team.`\Breakfast sausages, biscuits and eggs, and maple syrup. Baked beans i

Oh. Mah. Gawd. `\We remember playing spoiler from last year, and agree that it is fun. Just don't do it against us please.`\Like Rockets fans?`\PJ for GM`\Just wait. I'll turn on you tomorrow the first time I see some jazz flair mention Kanter lol. But today, today we're cool. `\i believe in the 4th Q rockets, always feels like it's an entirely different team. lets goooo`\Our defense went to shit when Bev got back on the floor`\kyrie's aggressiveness is different. he's running around like a madman on defense`\jimmer `\We would get swept, I love this team but I gotta be honest here. I think we're favored against any team not named Chicago or Cleveland`\Little bit of a flop by Lowry there lol`\Wrong thread my man`\His puppet is the best! `\F*** Houston`\Isn't your team playing right now?`\BeBe!!! Doing work!!`\Wtf take Cory out he's garbage today`\THAT'S A REALLY GOOD QUESTION BILL WHY DIDN'T TY DO ANY OF THIS IN HOUSTON`\Meh, I don't think this is true at all.  Utah played well against them last time, but Boston has never been a team I'm confident against.`\It's iffy, but I think he got all ball, Lowry did.

That should not be a flagrant at all, though.`\Team falling apart, LeBron trying to force Lue out, Cavs fucked.`\Kinda like all the 30+ point 8+ assist games Harden has that have gone to waste? `\Things I didn't expect to see, Brita commercial with Curry where he sounds high; check.`\Ball don't lie`\Battle of the Corey's. Who will be the busta?`\The Bulls look like such a different team with Butler. Defense is up, they're running more and he's getting to the line. I think his free throws help the team more than people think since he gets to the line more, Pau and Rose get a break more often`\Woo!!! We eating over here and hardens cooking!!! . . . yeah I can't fake it we're terrible right now`\Joining late. Looks like we're getting our shit pushed in. Synopsis? `\Yeah. But none of /r/NBA could do anything else better than him`\its gobert `\Kyrie is having a bullshit game tonight. `\Why does a bench player always goes off on us`\https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzpndHtdl9A`\Ty Lue > David Blatt`\Lol emoji tattoos `\I can't believe the rockets announcers are saying that hayward needs to make a real move to earn free throws.
Motherfucker, James Harden's entire game is based from rip through fouls.
Those aren't earned.`\na na na na, na na na na, hey hey hey. -the refs`\WOOOAH HARRELL `\nevermind`\I don't miss his dad either`\I love that the announcer said it was a good call, Paul went forward.`\Remember the good old days when he played for us?

^^^Dodged ^^^a ^^^bullet`\\>implying Dwight will get the call`\114 to be exact, based off your previous game.`\so... it is his fault for passing too much. him and love are the best players on the team. everyone shits on the best players so kyrie does deserve the blame for not adapting to what houston was giving him. harden did at the end and that's how he was able to get his team the win. `\Every Hubie game has him encouraging the less talented team if they're trying. He also loves pointing out improvements ("there you go!", "what did I tell you?", "now take a look at what happened here")

Source: am a fan of a team that is always less talented.`\what the hell is Dwight smoking this quarter`\Jazz have hit 13 three's tonight. Franchise record is 15 in a game`\Damn Davis... Back at it again with the clutch help`\I honestly think he could be. Which is why when people make trade plans with Ross I cringe cause I feel like he could really take off in a few years or next year. `\Flag 1 at the perfect of times... Fuck off`\He just runs blindly at the rim then misses or turns it over. No fucking clue how this clown is still in the rotation.`\I know, but those two were big enough that I made an exception `\Isn't that exactly what Ariza does?  I'm pretty sure Ariza is better than Barnes as well.`\GO EH-SPOORS EEST GO`\Ooh I heard Capela`\Beasley`\That was a great possession. Beasley was a great pick up`\Yes`\Why even say this? LoL`\since no one said it... if the raptors lose I'm deleting my account`\From going through his history, he looks to be a legit fan. Just a cynical one.`\It is rather laughable right now.`\Where is our offense?`\Wiggins defense is pretty good tonight.  I like his active hands.`\CLUTCH G`\:)`\Evan Turner.  He at most brushed off Harden after an intentional foul then possibly said something derogatory but it didn't *look* like a tech was necessary but I'll admit that I have not heard what was said down there.  It *looks* like they could have let it slide.  Probably didn't matter either way. `\6 millions chairs`\Great pass by G`\Yeah. but my team is missing their open shots, so I'm salty.`\Jazz playing flat out lazy right now. Weak with the ball + not hustling.`\I'll take what ever Dwight had before this game`\fuck the lakers tbh`\lmao pat: "you gon let the dude talk you like that"`\oh my harden`\You a Celts fan?  I think 6th vs Boston would be a great set of games.  Funny 'Cause it would sort of be the opposite of the '09 series except we'd still be the underdogs.`\Still can't believe they beat the Cavs and the Pacers.`\New Orleans is one of those games that I look forward to just on account of the commentator.`\Am I the only non-Rockets fan that doesn't hate the Rockets? `\Beastly`\not a popular opinion but I think he's pretty bias to one team when he does national`\Actually he usually drains a 3 at the end of a quarter/half.

This here was a really poor showing though.`\Wow, Stephenson is stupid.`\Does anyone else t feel like it's a clippers broadcast?`\COME ON LETS FUCKING GO
`\Half way through the game the Rockets are half way to the most missed 3 PT attempts (0-11) without a made basket set by the Blazers in 2011(0-20).`\No, you just got Rocket'd. When you're expected to blow them out but at the last second the tables turn`\Athreeeza `\They didn't... very next play Dellavedova changed his pivot foot, then lifted his second pivot foot before dribbling.`\Hey Utah, stop getting my hopes up if you're not going to follow through. Shit is getting old.`\We went on a run with Neto. If Quin gives minutes by performance he's gotta play him more in the 2nd half `\MACKDOWN AND RAW`\You two are adorable. `\I gotta admit, refs seem extra tough on howard`\PIZZA DAY IS EVERY DAY`\"Ref you suck" for giving an obvious technical. `\I actually completely believe that it was only called a flagrant 1 because it is Dwight. That man gets called for anything, surprised it wasn't a flagrant 7 (excessive existence as Dwight Howard)`\All the old Rocket guys on the Sixers going off`\Sorry, but that's not a technical foul unless he said something too. Weak shove.`\Gross. This has to be the least satisfying 1st seed ever.`\lol look at the ball?`\terrible defense. always had one dude open`\Leggo Brew Brew. `\I wish`\It's not easy to do what Bosh did on defense. A player who played the 4 most of his lift suddenly move to the 5 so the team can function better offensively but then he is a plus as a defender there too. Not many 4s in the game can do that. `\Delly just got Harden'd`\well utah needed this loss from houston `\Yeah but we're not super worried about that. Like if we get it, great. If we don't, no problem. It's kinda why I said 'almost.'`\Haha Fucking Joey had so much potential. `\that was some awful officiating.. harden was literally being hugged lol`\The defense will lose us this game anyway, but yeah, the refs have been ass.`\ugh

fucking end this shit now for the love of fuck

stepheson and hairston are just the worst`\Fucking 18 point lead my ass.`\Beat that ass baybee`\AYYYYYY`\a playoff opponent`\Don't do it if you don't want a tech simple`\I deflated, just so demoralizing. and yeah, capela was huge! just a wall at the end of the game`\I love how Harden makes junior high basketball mistakes on defense. 2 on 1 so let's just guard 0`\Go Jazz!!`\JUD BUECHLER IS ROLLIN IN HIS GRAVE`\austin rivers is wack`\SKAL!!!`\Look at that perfect hair!`\Missed the first half. Any specific reason Bebe played?`\lol dae cleveland sux`\For someone that really loves Harden so much, you really don't like being reminded of it. `\They all did`\pls raptors`\i feel like we get hard done by refs on the regular, and statistics have bore that out. and it really grinds my fucking gears`\That's a weird way of spelling Clippers`\beasley the based god`\Every team has a handful of losses, this team has admitted on numerous occasions that they are bored with the regular season.

It's clear that we only try against the other top teams and we've won a decent amount of those games`\Maybe Casey was too far up the court? Idk Wtf else they could have pulled out their ass `\Harden must be guarding Dante`\[Harden's step back.](https://streamable.com/03v2)`\Thib went to Houston, and he said their lack of defense was so evolved he couldnt do anything`\nr 3 girl is doing Flash`\Casey farted and ref didn't like what he had for lunch. T him up!!
`\Good`\James Harden is the man`\um, that call got our best player 4 fouls. it's perfectly comparable.

and oh look, our best player got another cheap one and now has 5.`\Raps as a whole were very unappreciative `\Lebron to the Cavs is like a really nice guy going back to an ex girlfriend who used to be amazing but just wasn't the one but you never lost feelings for her so you decide to try and make it work again but now shes a drug addicted gross whore named Cleveland`\if you let motiejunas set up his trebuchet shot hes pretty good at it`\Howard reminding us that he *can*`\Whaaaaat `\Alas, they didn't show anything...`\I would argue that Sam Mitchell is the worst mascot in the league`\.....refs super whistle happy for the rockets to start this half`\Yeah, it would of been LeBron drive kick out Ray Allen 3. Steal by Chalmers to LeBron alley-oop. Get a stop, Wade drive euro step and 1 finish. Then Bosh three to take the lead.`\jesus, dmo. `\Agree with that, that's just what the OP was getting at`\>Doesn't know how to box out

*Five Time Rebounding Leader*`\Yeah my bad`\Jazz winning rebounding battle by 11. Turns out we play well when we rebound.`\I'm not gonna be happy because he hits the occasional 3. He misses way to many, he ain't a 3 point shooter but always tried them `\3 pt woes continue.  0-11`\Bucks are choking hard.`\All aboard baby.`\Since YOU'RE clearly a little slow I'll spell it out for you.  The Cavs either singed TT to that contract or they're stuck with someone that would take the league minimum.  Those were the two choices.  Even though this has been explained a million times morons like you still need to spew this crap to appease the circle jerk.  `\And when it does, it's just to spare your feelings.`\Wow. TIL Houston is below .500`\Same call Millsap got earlier.`\Triple double with what? Points, D-Rebounds, Rebounds?`\3 > 6`\Why's it always gotta be about color with you?! Haha`\But only if you got a brain`\Lol the average age here is probably like 16`\Nooooo Brad`\yeah, but that's just coaches protecting coaches.`\Can we get an animated clip of Harden beating the shit out of an innocent chair during the timeout before the half?`\ZBO LEGEND YES KEEP FOULING HIM`\Refs trying to contain the Beas`\lol, if I was from Cleveland I wouldn't give a shit about it either. Must be terrible to be from a place so bad even the locals can't wait to get out and forget it. And once Lebron leaves, again, you'll go back to being the same complete joke of a team you've always been. Just like the Browns. At least I got to watch my team win a ring, and not have to see the local guy head to greener pastures to get his rings. You, and everything else about that shithole of a town, are pathetic and will be forgotten. Lol have a nice day.`\Oh is this the first time we've been down 15 early?`\they've got big heart tho...........but no instagram`\Was watching the game, Jazz down 15 or more and I was sad. GF said I wasn't, which I was Redditing and turned it to the Clippers cheerleader show. She went to the other room and I flipped it on with a minute left. Just in time to see the Rockets flop out of the playoffs :)`\Al is tired.  He is fouling a LOT on defense.`\as is tradition`\How original and inspired.`\THJ WITH THAT 4 POINT PLAY BOY.`\I'm used to it by now.`\THANK U <3`\I dont see anything different`\No, that should be flagrant.

Good balance.`\I hate these weak ass flagrants. `\Maybe once they're mathematically eliminated. `\It's so nice seeing Brewer put up a decent contribution on the bench.

Not saying he should leave, but that financial security is important to young guys.`\I'm fucking so tired of him being so god damn awful at free throws. Ffs he was 6/19 with a couple minutes left in the game when he was about to take his tech. People's biggest complaint about Dwight, rightfully so, is that he doesn't grow certain aspects of his game that are subpar. His post game is no better today than it was 8 years ago. Maybe even worse. And he seems unwilling to do anything to change his freethrow situation. He might as well shoot underhanded at this point.`\That's actually amazing haha.

Good luck to all and let's have a fun game.

(even though I really want us to win......)`\wouldn't surprise me if rick re aggravated something`\Foul for having someone piggy back you?`\Really? Because I remember this entire sub flooded with a ton of Cavs fans talking about how Blatt was a shitty coach because he:

Lost the locker room and didn't know how to play Kevin Love. I'm pretty sure we can go back to those threads and find all of those comments with a ton of Cavs fans discussing who should take his spot since they knew he wasn't going to last. The only difference is that no one thought he'd be fired during the season...but I don't know any Cavs fan on here who was defending him for his coaching . Hell, one argument was that he wasn't coaching and LBJ was just doing what he does`\Is that guy supposed to be Oscar the Grouch?`\...and yet you claim you're not trolling in our sub.  `\Harden already leads in MPG and thats only gonna grow after today. dude is gonna be SPENT come playoffs if they make it. `\Lol whatever you say bud`\Towns does 1 or 2 things a game that just make my say "damn."`\What fucking part of catch and shoot does lyles not understand!  Fuck fuck fuck`\Not until we punk the Clippers on Wednesday amirite`\antetokandula`\Ya`\JV can't defend elite centers. This always happens. `\goot shit JV`\I see you came to a neutral thread to ask this question :P`\GG Rockets. This was a legitimately great game. Michael Beasley and Tim Hardaway Jr. are the two best basketball players of all time. Kyle Korver dunked. Dwight banked in two free throws. Tim Hardaway Jr. played like 30 seconds with one of his shoes in his hand. Dwight allegedly sprayed Stickem on his hands and we changed balls only for that ball to get water all over it and change to a third ball. Hawks remain undefeated on Tinder night. We were 30 seconds away from Super Cool Bease being the only Rockets player to score in the fourth quarter. This game had everything.

As the other team who lost in the conference finals and have underperformed this season I really hope you guys figure it out and play well in the playoffs. `\Especially when it's the final shot`\The block, I think. `\That's exactly what I'm saying. McHale wasn't your problem- your toxic team is your problem. I'll be back to remind you of this when you go out in the first round. `\yeah man I'm going full on ave maria. if y'all beat them i would be so happy`\/r/NBAstreams`\Harden is sooooo good`\you mean fat white women?`\depends, does that also mean we don't get mozgov / jr / shumpert for dion and a first?

`\Biased. `\a stretch 4 with a deadly 3 point shot? it's a lock. `\Ok grandpa.that's enough reddit for tonight.`\Favors dunks on yo ass whether you like it or not`\they watch harden do the same thing every game and don't say anything`\why`\Homework is more fun than that nonsense at the end.`\Well well well, how the turntables...`\I'm not watching the game right now but this usually happens when he tries to get everyone involved early`\> but corey was brought here because of his excellence at the corner 3

and the lord turned to me and said, "that is when i carried you"`\same, freezes up every few seconds then catches up, then repeat.`\AVION TEQUILA SMOOTH MOVE OF THE GAME???`\Wrong. We played the 2nd and 3rd best team's in the east really well, both on the road, one of the better teams the league has ever seen, looking at 65+ wins this year well until the fourth, and the 5th seed in the west, who is 7-2 since Gasol went down, down to the last 30 seconds. Losing against Brooklyn was the only bad loss.`\I'm pretty sure I saw a study once where it showed that every point in the lead heavily decreases the chance of a drive. Guys just don't want to get banged up.`\That caught me at first as well I had to double check. It actually said "7th season as an NBA head coach". They were counting his Minny years.

Credit the Rockets for beating a team they should have and did beat, but, and to steal a saying from College B-Ball, this isn't a Resume Building win. Now, if they go on a tear and go 8-1/7-2 over their next nine to end the month with quality wins over the Clipps, Hawks, Raps, Thunder, and Cavs, then we can have this conversation.`\Dwight Howard is a monster.`\Giannis 4-5 on Jumpers tonight, HE DOESNT CARE!`\texture is different and yes it does taste better`\Rockets also look pretty out of sorts. `\Nothing about the rockets tonight has been "clutch."`\One mans trash is another mans treasure`\Thats blnot rockets basketball`\Can't play aggressive because the refs calling everything and that means this kind of stuff happens`\Oh the most obvious push EVER I agree man. `\*sigh.......*`\Its weird. I haven't watched the Grizz in like a week. And I barely recognize my own team right now. `\Can't watch but seeing some salty Minnesota fans, what's up?`\He gets an awful lot of bad or borderline calls going his way. Not all of them, of course, but quite a few.`\��`\Rip my fucking dick off`\The Spurs have a tiny market. You just sound bitter. There is no conspiracy. `\I guess Joey Crawford came out of retirement `\when you have a foul to give at the end of the quarter, i totally understand grabbing the guy and making them inbound again and giving them less clock, but i dont understand why they dont just go all out for a steal, either you get the steal, or foul. `\i think i hate the rocket reddit fans more than any other teams`\Bazz is beginning to piss me off more now`\Hey I think if we get beat by 50 again we'll be the first team in the league to be beaten by 50 twice in one season.

Would be the only redeeming thing from this awful season.`\Welp that's one we desperately needed.  Good to see the guys fight back and make it happen.   Maybe there's some life left in this team yet. `\I just finished Art of War today. Great read, highly recommend`\Rodney just showing off`\don't think i can really even articulate why haha, he just is, has been since i started watching him when he was on OKC.`\Is Jonas always this loud?

That's what happens when you don't get all the calls big guy.

Bet he's not even trying he just cares about the paycheck. `\You were probably one of those dumbasses saying they would have beat GS last year. `\That hair Harrell `\Chinese MVP, Michael Beasley.`\Only 7 showed up in the play by play.  I have no idea.

Still though, 1.7 below average, and coming later in the game after he was already out of rhythm.`\We've got him at the fucking vet minimum next year.

But looking at all the scorers on your roster, I just keep thinking how good Coach Cliff could do with it.`\Ah, of course`\Always somebody you'd never expect to go off on us...

Pretty weak.`\thats why we want him to get more playtime but cliff doesn't like him playing cus of his def`\Yeah, that's a mental thing that they'll improve on as time goes on. Elite teams have to learn how to play with a lead.

They don't push fast enough in transition off of OFF REB or TOs or even makes, which a lot of teams do against the Rockets for free points. They don't respond to the trap well, most teams break the Rockets trap relatively easily with one quick pass and maybe another for a easy basket. Another thing is not enough shooters so you can't make the Rockets pay for cheating. Also not enough straight and fast PnR action towards the basket and make Dwight move laterally which he can't really do.`\way to go`\Y'all still a number one seed lmao`\If you were to take a gander over at r/Texans, you would see that is emphatically true.

WE BOTH SUCK!

edit: nvm lol Harden got something off with 3 seconds left`\I haven't seen many Jazz games this season, but holy shit Rodney Hood is such a nice player.`\you're joking right?`\- I like how Hayward can put up about 20 points no matter the circumstances. His 16 in the 4th quarter sealed the deal.

- Rudy Gobert vs. Wolves trying to dunk on him happened again today. Blocked LaVine and Smith's dunks and Wiggins had a couple nasty ones.

- Trey Lyles is legit.`\Troy Daniels sighting!`\He probably gives excellent eugugolies.`\Fuck`\He's mostly right, he just doesn't have the funds to take the fines yet.`\Confident. Absolutely..... Not. Unless it's the Clippers. I don't think he can beat the Warriors, Spurs, or Thunder `\Eyyoooo`\Yep, you got it bud`\yeah man. the intentions are really endearing, but i imagine he just wants things to go as usual.`\One of those games where no one even wants to pretend to play d I guess. Everyone just jogging back.`\Uhhh yeah, me too...definitely me too. `\How is that not 3 sec?`\great d`\My point was the pattern of no calls is enabled by refs that swallow whistles, not by a conspiracy.

Favors is 8/11`\huh. how so? doesn't he just look like some assistant coach in a suit?`\This sequence almost making up for that first half. `\he will be concussed because anytime anything goes well for us the basketball gods strike down with injury`\We'd probably give Dwight the ball in the post more if he could pass out of it when he gets triple teamed`\I think I speak for all the TWolves fans saying that we won't be sad after today's performance by our cute fluffy point guard.

This game actually shows our main weakness which is the bench.`\Tbh, most people are but yeah.... You have to have some level of respect and professionalism . He is still a good NBA player .`\No.

They had been force feeding him into the post the last several games before this and he has either struggled to get position, turned it over and has been fouled.

And in all of those games, their offense was stagnant when they tried to do it.`\Rudy is such an embarrassment on offense`\I want some El Jazz jerseys!`\Whoa Goon squad D just put the clamps down or what? 11 pts for Jazz in the 2nd?!`\The ref over-reacted there.

I like you.`\How do you mesh that bench with the starters? Every time Towns leaves the floor, two of Dieng-Bjelica-Smith have to play, and Dieng isn't that great of a fit with either Smith or Bjelica. You can try staggering Wiggins-Lavine, but Prince isn't that effective at this point and Muhammad is... just not that great.

There aren't any good solutions -> putting five guys together that you know can score and hoping the other five can maybe keep it within a few points might be the best option, especially at this point in the year. Seeing if Rubio-Lavine-Wiggins-Dieng-Towns can be a long term solution, and figuring out how each of them needs to improve, might be more important than making the bench not a dumpster fire.`\Rockets announcers are like the Texas-homer version of our announcers`\Jerryd "Long Two" Bayless`\What did he say?`\Jim Petersen is great. `\lol that rockets d`\It's a bite your tongue contest every day`\What a game `\Because he sucks.  `\Don't be silly, why would a Pelicans fan that has been redditing for 7 days say something like that?`\This is the Jazz we know.`\Somehow I'm hyperaware of every miss.`\Blind blind blind`\?`\Please, Chicago.`\Noooo `\Wow..wtf `\If BREVIN thinks it is a flagrant, then it must be`\I really like Evan Turner.

edit: Are we really going to downvote him? We could experiment with later on in the season `\Would you say he's the man?`\yeah he never seemed elite at one thing, but decent at a lot of things.  Ross regressed last year before rounding back to form this year, hopefully T Jones can do the same`\was that a long ass 2nd Q or what?`\TRADE EVERYONE. BUILD AROUND BEASLEY.`\Also with Blake healthy they run a lot of offense through him as well, even though CP got healthy midway through Blake's 30 games played his assists didn't increase dramatically until Blake went out. Plus there's the hacking DJ factor - CP didn't get an assist the last 4 or 5 minutes of this half because the Rockets were hacking, might've had 12-15 in the half if that didn't happen.`\This game meant almost nothing but god damn that's fucking infuriating.`\Jersey colours were kinda confusing...`\I'm standing by you, man. I honestly don't understand why anyone would want to say something like that.`\Our bench D is just flat out bad.

I feel like Rockets and Pelicans are really in this shithole together and neither of us wins tonight`\I can't say I'm surprised. The people of Eastern Pennsylvania are known to be petty.`\Well you can say that for a lot of teams. Thing is, players like harden don't have the option of "being off".

Beas ain't fuckin' with all that he's just hitting shots, no matter where they're from`\She substitutes for Alaa when he's not there. She's also fucking terrible`\what the hell is this?`\Welp.

I think we match up against the Pacers too, despite struggling earlier in the season. The scary thing is George, but I think Jae and Marcus could push him around enough to throw him off his game. Not scared of anyone else there. Would be very confident against the Bulls or the Wiz too, they both just look like a mess. `\Plays are called. Seriously? Did you watch delly before Kyrie came in?

I feel like we get screwed by refs way too often and the fact that we never contest any calls may have something to do with it `\shelvin mack fucking gets buckets`\Kemba should get MIP`\Holy shit Beas is feeling it.   I just hope he doesn't pull a typical Beasley move and think it means he's free to jack up shots for the remainder of the game. `\THE MOON LANDING WASNT REAL `\He's leaving`\Jazz fans been talking trash about taking a playoff spot from somebody but losing 4 games in a row isn't gonna cut it`\I see no flaw in this statement. `\Seriously, get Brewer out of there.`\Do people not realize that?  I figured most NBA fans know that he is one of the best in the league.  If not it's because the media hates places like Utah`\Yeah dude.

Then, as he says he's sorry, and brushes the spilled popcorn off your shirt, his hand just kind of -- stops. On your chest. And suddenly The Departed doesn't seem to matter anymore. You exhale.

Hayward gently takes the bowl of popcorn off your lap and sets it on the coffee table. Let me get this out of the way, he says with a sly smile.

This is why I find it crazy when people keep telling me that Cavs would have won the Finals last year healthy...heck, just today I had a friend tell me that AGAIN, and thinks this time Cleveland will win it all no matter what.`\That's a goaltending`\So Lamar knew about the stuff going on between Khloe and Harden?

Edit: there we go `\we were shooting 7% worse than houston when we had a double digit lead.

lowering that to 12% is what happened. We just couldn't drop shots. same thing against the nets. I'm starting to think that the role players are the ones that aren't putting the true work in. Only dellavedova hasn't regressed from last year.

we literally use the exact same gameplan without lebron as we do with him, that's why we're losing. combined, Love and Kyrie only shot 7 more shots than they usually would, when lebron not playing leaves 18 shots to be taken. they need to absorb at least 75 % of those shots.

We shouldn't ever have a lineup of delly, shump, jefferson, tristan and frye in. That's usually a lineup that either kyrie or lebron is in for jefferson and that was the lineup where we threw the game in the beginning of the fourth. it gave houston the momentum they needed to take the game away.

if you don't believe me, watch the first 2 minutes of the fourth. we win if those 2 minutes dont happen

I have never looked up that stat nor did I know the NBA had it open to the public.  So thanks for that. I agree with your analysis but on top of what you said I think Harden is a genius when it comes to getting to the line. He seemed to know the rules inside and out. He seems to know where the refs are at all times so he can get calls at the right viewing angles.

Everyone always complains about him but it's the game and he knows the rules.

I'm hoping against reason that our guys get healthy right in time for playoffs, and we upset the Thunder or Clippers in a 7 game series. I want this game to stay in my memory just for that, so the juxtaposition makes it all the better.`\Srsly Bucks, this isn't funny`\Kyrie is not going to pass in these last 2 minutes. `\He damn well didnt!! I made it and got to -40`\:(`\I can't stop listening to new Kendrick, still haven't turned on the game.`\we were all rooting for you tonight :(`\the flashing red three point line is annoying and unnecessary imo `\lmao and utah was thinking about getting ty lawson`\I really think if we get the 6th seed we can actually get to the 2nd round!`\He's a real piece of shit, but it's nice when they're your piece of shit.`\That clutch win in Dallas seems like months ago. We are the chokiest team in the league right now. `\Westbrook takes plays off on D pretty regularly now, and when he doesn't he's a huge gambler. I think he definitely has the potential to be a nightmare on D, but he doesn't do that consistently.`\Looked like a charge`\Well let them back in the forth`\Technical my cock, he didn't do shit!`\It's 80-59

shut up`\It's really cute when perimeter players think they have a mismatch with Favors off the dribble.`\Cavs yall should just chill out and take it easy. Ya.`\Shabazz don't give a shit about what you guys think`\fair. be a wolves fan. Make some OC and post on /r/timberwolves `\Wtf 4 turnovers...`\Schedule loss. After last night's double OT game, plus LaVine and Wiggins playing like shit. `\Was beasly the only person to score in the 4th?

Good game Houston, good luck Utah & Dallas `\Jabari and Giannis work so well together. Games like these give me so much hope.`\How many kids does Dwight have now ?`\It's not even that, it's the fact he pump fakes before almost every shot looking for the contact.`\Lol you tried Bev. `\Was it our last game when we were down 14 with 4 left in the fourth but won?`\he is destined for 20+ pts tonight`\why is harrell behind Beasley in the rotation`\Don't forget partying`\Thank you based Lebron! `\LeBron is that principle who gets mad at the students for not listening to the teacher`\goddamit Kehlani`\Who was sayin they don't like Favor's jump shot? It's money tonight.`\Alright 9th seed`\What??? How did you get that? Butler has better raw and advanced stats all across the board, is a better defender, and all the while playing more minutes.`\How many times have we blown a big lead this season? Absolute joke

Edit: downvote me all you want, I don't get what I said that's wrong `\Pat "snitch" Beverly`\Remember when we lit up the Hawks for 72 in the first half earlier this year? `\Which is under .500`\ouch`\The bench finally starts to produce, and the starting lineup decides to play like shit.  Of course...`\anyone who blames the rockets defense on harden definitely doesn't watch this team. it's a shitshow all around`\I wouldn't say that's the main reasoning but it was certainly a factor.`\Fate`\I'm familiar with it too. `\lol zbo `\Cavs suuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuck.  I was jk when I told my girlfriend "Watch them lose after this lead." I should've bet money!`\I mean, they have 43 wins and more than you, so I wouldn't say they finally got a win.`\Hacking when you're ahead is so lame.`\hows that also not a foul?`\Dmo for 3mo`\THATS WHY WE LOVE U TROY`\Wellll...`\Fair enough, nah i havent been watching that closely. They're just moving the ball well today, so many assists.`\Oh shit I don't think I can respect DL anymore. I absolutely HATE Olympus. Shitty people go there.`\Nuthin' but net, baby.`\Well yeah, I think it's a little of column A and column B.  At a certain point you could tell Harden just wasn't interested in playing with him.`\Good defensive effort Dwight lol`\bring up a pic on your cellphone dad`\I just needed to name 10 quickly.  Surely I could keep going.`\Finally dropped Khloe `\We all of a sudden can't hit anything `\Dwight is in full Charles Barkley mode`\420 BEAS IT`\There's defence on the perimeter, just none in the paint. `\Solid joke there`\finally some good jazz defense`\BAEEEEEEEEE CROWDERRRRRR`\We just need to make it to the 8th seed and we'd hit 80 threes in a row I took stats in college (6.52% for those counting)`\I hope Kyle Lowry comes back to Ontario after basketball and runs for Parliment or something. `\I feel ya, just don't want to see the bulls in the first round. `\Mother of God`\Oh yeah, that was the one he did on Colbert, I believe. `\He got 8 in like the first 6-7 minutes. A couple were just short passes to JJ 3's but we got obliterated in the first quarter`\Not taking anything from his glorious past. Dwight Howard was a top big man in the league.

However if you looked at the game tonight you cannot tell me that the dude is prolific with rebounds.`\oh right.`\Beard stroking his beard and Beasley wishing he had more beard `\in most any other season they would be. Unfortunately for them, two of the best teams ever are in the league this season. Its going to take a TEAM to beat GSW and SAS, Cleveland is just very clearly nowhere near where they need to be`\But your English teacher be having a fit.`\Lol that was quick`\How did you get so much swagger from your girl?

Yeezy taught her. `\OMG Dwight! `\Pls. This is the first time in 15 years were competitive. `\aye, me as well`\And yeah, Thomas didn't even flop, he's just getting them all star calls now.`\What the hell? I really thought they'd show up. I guess it's been a good 2nd half then?`\Now people finally see that Lebron has to carry this team mentally. `\just for curiosity I want prefer to see both  combinations especially if were locked into the second seed towards the end the season.

Big endorsement contracts. Ad buys during games.`\We're only up by 4 just before halftime? Shocker. `\YOU DARE QUESTION THE LORD?!? `\Harden can't even make his free throws!!!`\The first half I thought the Cavs played pretty well last night, just didn't make the shots. Jazz D was tough too. We moved the ball, had some open looks, played okay defense (minus Kyrie) and had the chances just didn't make shots when we needed because it was an off shooting night.



The Warriors had an off shooting night against LAL and no one said "these guys just don't fit." I know we have MORE off nights, but we really have played pretty good team offense the past few games. Last night the defense was pretty suspect in the second half with everyone just looking for a help defender and not actually trying to stop their man first. `\CARRY ON MY HAYWARD SONNNNNNNNNNN

Danial I think?`\wow cavs, what a melt down of a game`\Wtf. I watch the GSW-Knicks game for like 2 minutes since it switched over during halftime and back to back to back 3s by Curry. Do GSW even need to gameplan anymore or do they just ask Steph to stand outside the arc.`\WHO DA MAN? HARDEN DA MAN`\That's because Leo is doing colour commentary.`\That's my strong hand!`\Barely. But i remember. My favorite player was TMAC when he was in Toronto and Orlando.

That was awesome`\GL Bucks!`\What's up with Howard? Last few games I've seen of the Rockets he seems pretty useless out there, and a lot slower than I remembered. `\Volatile and extreme. I like it.`\its actually over, according to the formula`\NAWWWW SHIIEETTETETETT`\Giving you the benefit of the doubt, I just watched it again and I'm like 99% sure was no contact with the ball to his face.   There's a replay from one direction that definitely looks that way, but on the Rockets broadcast they showed another angle from behind and you can see pretty clearly that there wasn't any contact.  Im not sure what angles they showed on the Jazz broadcast though. `\we only need to play better defense make more shots stop turning it over and make more free throws and we'll win`\PleSe`\EUROSTEP`\This team is in the fuckin zone right now`\Lol, it's all good.

No doubt the Cavs had the right gameplan, but when Draymond Green and Harrison Barnes forget how to shoot open jumpers then that's on them, not the scheme by the Cavs. Still, I think the injury to Irving and Love was a blessing in disguise. The Cavs turned into a defensive juggernaut without them.`\> I honestly don't know. I don't hold a lot of weight in /r/NBA's opinion on anything related to the Cavs these days so I honestly can't say.

Heard that. I think he's made good win-now moves. Even if LeBron has final say or whatever the case may be, I think he's done a good job. LeBron's not the one on the phones everyday looking for trades to bolster the depth of the team like the JR/Shump/Mozgov trades did.`\Mack to Favors oop, nice`\THIS IS WHAT LAST YEAR FELT LIKE.

Gg Utah. I have no idea how we're such a bad matchup against you guys`\I can only see your comment.
Edit: Never mind `\I love JV but that's something bb8 does better is not go back in and clog the paint up `\Now that we have no chances of playoffs he has no pressure :3`\make a shot and get a tech...i cant think of anything more boneheaded`\at this point i honestly believe jb has not watched us play basketball all season. it's like he still has no idea who our best pfs are.`\We only won by 49? Rockets need to step it up`\Harden still does shit that kwahi would never do `\Give me Harden over WB`\Probably. `\Because that's who the Rockets are this season. `\we gave u a win shut up`\That was straight Shaqtin from Lance`\It's weird as fuck watching this Houston team when Harden doesn't have the most shots. Dude is their best player and scorer but has only 6 shots in the half`\I mean the young guys, I want Capela to be experienced and KJ have a smooth jumper with Montrezl banging the shit out of everyone down low, u know`\Lowry and DeRozan both ejected.... fml.`\Lyles is eating Boston's lunch`\can someone slap JB? stop with the dumb ass traps`\truuu. hopefully harden can find whatever it is he seems to be missing right now`\he contorted his way around Favs there was no contact `\Signing Beasley next year would be such a doc move. `\You just described our season in a nutshell.`\More like fourth or fifth shot. Still like him though, he still probably warms up with half court shots like he did on wolves.`\GG Toronto. Time to be a Pelicans fan for the next half an hour...and I see they've lost their lead and AD has 6 points.`\i think they only started 7 players.  then one left the game due to injury.  those dudes played the whole damn game.`\Says who?`\ahh. nba.com is so slow`\Didn't they decide that was an offensive foul at some point?`\ugh shaq and the starters are gonna love that TO`\Bzz`\Batum just told the ref "He's flopping hard"`\Booker tried to tip that in with a sledgehammer `\Naw, not really . `\Houston is hounding Lowry at the three point line. Get BB on the roll or swing the ball for a three (like they did with DD)`\ref had to think about that one for a secomd`\So I tune into the game and see Michael fucking Beasley score like 10 straight points in the 4th.....Wtf`\Are you actually banned? I thought he was joking..`\Beardo`\Better 3P% than FT% - so rockets.`\Lol, to be honest, I don't really mind when people like you say things this mind numbingly asinine about Houston. A city with more parks and museums than almost any other major American city. I don't mind because when people as dumb as you come here, and leave saying things like that, it keeps other dumbass people from moving here. So, please, keep talking shit, because the only people who are going to listen to you and actually believe you are most likely just as brain dead and culturally unaware as you are. So, once again, thanks for leaving!`\his j is so wet `\Didnt know Niko is back too.`\I thought it was pretty disrespectful to right away call him a locker room poison. I've never heard rumors of him being a poison. Yea his nba career didnt pan out right but shit.`\I'll take 5`\B-Easy! Always root for that guy, wherever he plays.`\I love watching Beasley ball out.

I love watching Beasley ball out against the Cavs even more.`\Not if the refs have something to say about that`\Is he?`\We're hitting all our 3's and more importantly Memphis has more injuries than Normandy beach on D-day`\He's a bear wearing a rabbit outfit cause it's Easter on Sunday.`\I'll delete my account if raps make it out of the first round playoffs `\Gus Johnson's only bias is for EXCITING BASKETBALL CITY`\I guess I'd rather see him over-aggressive.`\No blood - no foul. `\you missed the word "corner" in your stat. go look at his corner 3 numbers before he came over.`\AD with literally the worst offensive night of basketball I've ever seen in my life, and it's only the first half.`\I was at that game last time and I'm at this game. Still undefeated when I attend `\Meanwhile, the Bucks are up 15. Which is nice.`\This was the sloppiest game I've seen the C's play since Minnesota. Smart was awful.

Please don't draw any more attention. I don't want to become a scapegoat (sry guys).`\Winslow is a better slasher I believe if you take out the 3pt attempts from Smart hes shooting 42% while Winslow inside the 3pt line is shooting 50%. Also winslow is like 3-4 years younger while Marcus Smart has regressed`\What I tell ya `\WHo the fuck is this bitch talking????`\Don't worry I'm pissed too. Turns out the team isn't where we thought they were. But still a good chance at playoffs.`\mah heart

Some people don't like how he plays the game, but we've never seen this kind of production per 36 from a man that is confirmed to be over 100 years old. Truly impressive, Jew-hating aside.`\Good game Raptors, fuck these refs this isn't a way I want to win. Was a good game despite their bullshit `\trey lyles wants to shoot hte 3 and he fucking nails them shits`\unless you're T-mac.`\I know that bias factors in, but I adamantly believe that the Jazz get screwed by the refs the most out of any team.

`\Wow, had no idea you guys were in the 7th seed. Quietly having a decent season, congrats!`\Not defense?`\What a fucking pass!`\I do think there's a good chance Dwight fouled him though.

`\Jimmy is definitely a bit rusty `\wtf refs?`\cause this is houston rockets basketball. `\Lebron would bring in Mark "The Reverend" Jackson. `\I think he was using that as a possible explanation to missing so many three's, not to losing the game overall. You guys played well and I hope you snag that 8th seed.`\That was awkward`\He's playing a weird game... he's only attempted 2 field goals and has 1 point.`\Fuck that trade Lowry and waive DeMar. Lets blow this shit up.`\no`\What happened to Harden hasn't he been really good recently?`\Yeah, it's just if there's any rockets criticism I'll agree with its our announcers are kinda dicks to the away team.

Rubio was fantastic tonight`\he's shooting above 40% this year (small sample size alert) from each corner, so if you stick him in the corner I think it's fine, and he can easily attack close outs from there if he gets the ball. probably are reasons the coaching staff isn't doing that, but I don't think it's as crippling as it seems at first glance`\Agree about your coach. He seems like he knows what he's doing `\I still can't wrap my head around the fact that rockets suck so bad with all that talent. `\Since you're clearly a little slow, I'll put it simply for you: TT is not worth 5 years, $82,000,000.

I'd think the chances of securing the #1 draft pick as a lottery team (which are, as you know, incredibly low) would be better than making it deep into the playoffs as an 8th seed. `\Well the rockets were down by 17 (I think, someone look it up) on what was supposed to be the game to send them home...

`\We're getting good looks.

Mack and Hood just had an off night, I guess.

Edit: Also helped that the Jazz didn't look too much to exploit our trash transition defense`\"Houston are 1st in the league in steals."

I am genuinely confused.  Is it just the media that purports them as having some horrible ass defense/team defense?  Or am I completely missing something here.`\Now I know why people make fun of Harden's defense..`\We understand one another.`\they're down 10 now, they're going to eventually win by ~6`\And Bismack with a block right away `\For sure.

I only caught the last few minutes of the game, but Capela's looked better than Dwight on the defensive end. When our D is locked in and playing aggressively we have our big come up to challenge and trap a la the Lebron Heat and Capela's just so much quicker on the perimeter. Makes me wonder about our offseason plans for Dwight.
`\Anybody else like Kevin Harlans voice?`\"Sorry partner"`\We need 2nd half Hayward, dad dick hood, and favs needs to continue to play like a man for us to have a chance at winning. `\Last I checked it was 22-22, what happened?`\hey derrick favors had 6 fucking blocks that i dont recall`\Let me guess, Collins said that?`\Wow the raps are upset lol`\It would really surprise me if so`\The ref blew his whistle before Neto even reacted`\nah, let it out james.`\Wow `\not following rockets games. do you tend to always be behind in 1Q?`\D-Mo was straight up.

No offense to the rockets, they can obviously play with anyone. `\About as many times as we've given up a 10+ point lead `\I personally like harden. I have never said he wasn't good and I do not join the circlejerks on this sub about the rockets, harden, clippers, griffin, etc. It's annoying as fuck and we get circlejerked upon as well. No one protects anyone on here so I'm not sure what you mean.`\So here's the argument against Harden being in the Top 5 (I have no idea how you could leave him off the Top 10 though, that's insane). This is **NOT MY PERSONAL BELIEF**, just so people don't jump all over me for it.

On the court, Harden is unstoppable but if what the recent reports about him getting the front office to fire McHale and trade Howard are true, than the thing keeping him off the Top 5 list likely the off court stuff interfering with the team goals. The other thing is the narrative that he sucks on defense. I dunno how true that actually is because I don't personally get to watch a lot of Rocket games but that's what I read a lot on the internet. `\Within the context of previous flagrants this season that may have qualified with the contact to the head.

The Jazz do traditionally well against the modern Cavs, and against LeBron in general. We're also a playoff caliber team. If your squad isn't taking games like this seriously then you need to rethink your strategy.

How does that old saying go? Fool me once...`\Couldn't even wait a few minutes to get the "fuck leo" comments started eh?`\lmao shut up, its funny af`\Hahahaha`\"Thats how you get an assist you find out who the best shooters are and pass them the ball."

-Worrell

Preciate that Bill`\They type of guy you'd love if he was on your team, otherwise you can't fuckin stand him`\Have you looked at tht "playoff teams" starting lineup?`\Yeah I don't know what happened this year. He hasn't been shooting well.`\Our struggles are 100% effort, and it's the worst thing as a fan to watch `\i'm a harden (and to a lesser extent dwight) fan haha`\Yeah he's still bad. I can't claim to have expert eyes, but in my opinion, he's looked better as the season has progressed. He's actually made a couple clutch defensive plays this year, which is encouraging.

The other part of this is that our defense as a whole has actually been pretty shit this season, no matter who is in the paint. I think it's more a problem of team/wing defense rather than one guy. `\THE EURO STEP WILL GET YA`\you have my address, send me some stances i love that brand`\Jeb Bush is shedding a single tear someplace alone because of the savageness of this comment`\I don't understand why DD is defending Hayward? It's causing so many problems when he starts rolling of screens... DD can't keep up `\Except he can't pass or play any kind of defense `\Holy shit the wolves took Rubio over curry?? Oh my god how have I never heard this`\I think that last 14-0 run is gonna prove pivotal down the track for the Jazz.
`\Lol ok dude.`\...was that a 3?`\Raps gotta be the least feared playoff team ever lol `\Makes sense. Yeah, if it wasn't 11, I wouldn't have done it. I feel like if it's late and there's a reasonable margin, we'll put our best lineup out and let Harden do his thing.`\Don't forget 2Pat`\Yup, and he's done so much to turn his reputation around since coming to Memphis. He's seriously just a family man who does a bunch of charity work now`\Yep, you got me bro. I'm on Harden's dick. You're not on mine. If it bothers you so much, stop responding to me and stop mentioning me.`\I mean... they're down 3 at the start of the second quarter. There's a slight chance we're able to climb back into this somehow.`\Lol, I expressed an opinion, cunt. Don't get pissy like a little girl cause your team got embarrassed on national TV by the Rockets. You guys are garbage without LeBron. Plus your city is one of the worst in the country. Your whole existence is shit lol.`\I actually feel kind of bad for Harden.

I've lost count of the times I've seen it argued that Butler is better than Harden. And if that was true, it would place Harden firmly out of the top 10.`\I feel like I've seen this comment before on another thread like 30 seconds ago. Weird`\God GM Bud? `\towns have my babies `\I was kidding`\Lets go raps. Harden plz dont go hard`\today was a good day`\Nah, Z-bound is putting up his own miss lol`\Chicago pizza sucks.

Could be worse.`\they do enough just to keep us watching`\Someone in the comments said they saw him with a suit on `\16`\LaVin3`\Everyone. We love Booker but Lyles is simply better.`\He can't really move or jump much, but has some pesky hands defensively, a nice jump shot, and a really good court vision. He's kind of a like a Boris Diaw type driver how he slowly gets into the lane looking for options. Believe it or not he's also ran the point while guarding small ball 4s for is (or rather pure 3's in the 4 spot).

I don't know the cap space and if it's even possible, but I think it would be a good idea to try to sign Harrison Barnes. He doesn't need the ball to produce and can hit those spot-up 3s that Harden dishes out. `\Plus that crafty little push-off on the baseline.

I have never seen a cavs team like this, that can go from championship level to god awful, in the same game. I really think it all stems from Kryies inability to lead this team. At times, our ball movement can be so bad that, just like tonight, we can give up a 19 pt lead and lose the game. I had more confidence in last years team than i do this year.

Houston was probably too big of a city for him to really prosper right`\I've only caught the last few minutes of the game, but Capela's looked better than Dwight on the defensive end. When our D is locked in and playing aggressively we have our big come up to challenge and trap a la the Lebron Heat and Capela's just so much quicker on the perimeter. Makes me wonder about our offseason plans for Dwight. `\Because Lue pissed this game away`\> not to disrespect Toronto like that.

That wording is so asinine. It's an opinion. If he thinks that one team matches up well against another team, that's not disrespect.  That's seriously Stephen a. Smith kinda stuff.`\how's the game so far?`\Ariza career high assists.... kill em`\I knew Harden has a ton of FT's, but holy hell. He has over 100 FTM than DeRozan. DeRozan gets to the line so often that seeing him behind by 100 is insane.`\If Raps tied this, I would cry`\Ahh yes the weekly Cavs meltdown, right on schedule. `\Now get that 7 seed Chicago`\has to be the coaching. our rotations are like always out of sync until late in every game when everyone decides to give a shit. you'll probably see that tonight lol. `\rockets getting in contender mode`\He re-injured the same finger. That's extremely common.`\Make that 11 now`\B-B-BAE`\������������

Maybe you guys will get an all-time great someday.`\Video pls `\[Who doesn't?](http://imgur.com/shI2j0Q)`\Hopefully Harden goes off. We need this loss since we're only a half game back of the 8th seed.`\*refs panically push fuck over Jazz button*`\Gather bruh`\Thomas has a beautiful floater.  Floats so well he could play for Byu`\FYI you're a -16 in my RES`\Well, obviously Memphis was crippled by injuries, but hopefully we can take that big win and gain some momentum from it. Portland lost huge tonight so the 6th seed is within reach!`\lazy fucking team. ariza gets stuck, nobody comes to help him out. then we don't run back on defense and give up a 4 footer. weak shit.`\Thanks Bulls. One step closer to forgiveness`\I'm going to assume you're a virgin`\He honestly does. I couldn't imagine the Cavs without the spacing that JR brings. Wiggins isn't really a great shooter, and not that great of a team defender. He plays in the same area as TT, Mozgov, Love to some extent, Lebron, and Kyrie when he drives.`\Meanwhile we've also faced adversity, but decided to go ahead and suck.`\cavs dont really care for the latinos `\You're looking too far into this stupid comment of mine`\What a call. What a screen. What a shot.`\Blake doesn't when he's healthy? `\GO EH-BOOKS GO!`\Good luck Bucks. I have a feeling that this going to be an ugly game.`\that's more like it`\Anyway I can sign up for that? Asking for a um friend `\AD is 2/9 in the paint.`\Fucking bullshit.  So Jeremy doesn't get the exact same call right before that?`\He is very skilled at his size. Shame his lateral quickness is relatively slow as it limits his defensive potential`\Let's go Beas!`\This game they got fucked over imo`\mmmm clear path. That was a close one though.`\You didn't question the fit of Love or Kyrie. Also forgot to ask if Frye is better than Love and provide expert opinion on what our rotation should be.



Good reaction but you could over-react a little bit more if you tried. `\I didnt expect to win this game, but the Jazz had to go and tickle my balls with a double digit lead. Now im just a disappointment fountain`\I mean, they have a lot more individual talent than we have. I still think we're a better team.`\GG and forgive Wiggins guys, he will roll`\Don't worry the refs'll redefine clear path of it makes it in your favor`\But he hasn't had one single game where he was given a chance yet. Getting 5 minutes every 5 games wont show you how good a player is. `\Shoot, we might be also if the third seed is locked in`\.... Do I have to say it for them? *sigh* fine.

Obviously lebron never drive Kia's `\Lue usually subs them in with around 7 or 8 minutes left. Might come back in after the next timeout`\People don't like rockets on this sub. As a fan from birth basically, it's not really my decision which team I like, no matter what happens in my life I will still root Houston. When people validate that we do have a decent team instead of nitpicking every single win as Harden being evil, refs suck, fuck Beverly, Dwight's a bitch, etc. it feels good because often (especially in game threads) just my flair alone illicits downvotes. You saying "hey my team fucked up, rockets just outplayed us" makes me feel justified. Thank you.`\adults can be stupid too`\I'm not complaining to or about the Rockets.  I'm not complaining about anything.  I'm not sure what you're getting at here.  I'm telling you that you're wrong.  Not the Rockets. `\Let's go Scola!`\Should be a fun game. Rockets were impressive winning in Toronto the other day, and ended the Raptors 12-game home win streak. Hopefully we can protect home court and extend our own streak.`\That's too bad. We joke about Mickey... this is literally the first minutes that wasn't the last 10 seconds of a 4th that he's gotten, but Lyles looks like a guy that SHOULD get some time on the court. `\Mack attack`\Tech for what?`\no play on the ball`\The Grizz are shooting 27% omg`\Hayward been shooting it way too well to only have 12 shot attempts this game.

Also despite every reason to give up Howard, trades for Whiteside and other players weren't pursued before the deadline even though theres been talk at getting rid of him, I can't help but feel that there's some plan on the table for the off season.

Like, seriously, wtf`\I love how both DD and Lowry taken only 1 shot but 7 Asts already and Raps have lead `\Someone put a dent in that refs face.`\Dude has been commenting with the caps lock on all game, mostly about how garbage the refs are.`\Thx bby`\It was a pretty lay up doe
`\Realize it? We gave him a Max Contract. What more do you want?`\If these people played their absolute best, it would be an uphill battle.  All these dumbass mistakes aren't helping.`\what did biyombo do?`\come on wiggins stop being so fuckin weak with the ball dude `\Ahh thanks. Lou had his attributes, I feel he really helped propell our offence last year adding an additional offensive weapon in outside shooting. Don't miss his defence. Bebe still has high ceiling where he can eclipse the value and contributions Lou gave us.

Lou also had two GF at the same time. `\Oh my god wtf are these refs `\2nd in FGA though so that's not so great.   Although to be fair, he got like 3 of those on rebounding his own shot and putting it back up. `\turnover forced by the shotclock that was horseshit`\????? HOW IS THAT NOT A FOUL ON SMART??!?!?!?!`\there we go giannis  `\He isn't on a 3 year contract that report was false.`\damn harden has been missing a lot of free throws lately `\Jesus Christ are you serious Booker????????????`\The entire NBA is against Utah `\We are .5 out of the 8th seed! Bandwagoner`\which will ultimately amount to another year without a championship for your city, what's new `\leave him alone, hes a huge Vin Diesel fan`\GO EH-READING COMPREHENSION GO`\That's how this years has been for us, but it's just one game. When are y'all getting some players back?`\Shut this down Beard`\These refs need disciplinary action for this game. Absolute farce`\And releasing Lawson`\holy fuck, every god damn ref crew in this league calls dwight for the tiniest bullshit.`\i don't think you understand. strippers are the source of james' power. considering this is atlanta, i'm expecting a 45/12/11 night.`\See I feel like the Clippers hate is almost entirely concentrated in the western conference fanbases whereas ours are hated from coast to coast. `\What an effort by Harden`\I don't think Lebron playing coach is as big a deal as everyone is making out. He is a leader on the team and he does this when he is playing, why would he stop caring because he isn't playing?`\Hope we *make* the playoffs. I know everyone's writing us in, but as a lifetime Charlotte sports fan I know to never count my chickens. I do love this team though, and think we can win a series`\Is current form like today, a week, a season?`\[Knew it would be out there somewhere](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/B9c8tgMCAAE8oof.jpg)`\we dont want wins anymore`\I noticed, maybe Dwight thought his defender was lurking and didn't want to risk the pass. Either way it didn't look good. `\I guess those 14 shots were wide open.`\easily`\Dwight didn't even jump lol`\Eww soccer is somehow even worse with players tripping over nothing trying to get a call.`\Too late`\It's always that one ref with the greased back hair too`\who tf is christiano felicio
`\Subpar defender can't stay in front of good player lmao`\Bunch of rest before the Warriors game on Monday. Gonna be great game.
`\supercoooolbeas`\That's because he's been giving 100% all season and it's going to waste. Every time he has a monster game they lose because not everyone shows up. `\Wet toilet paper`\Hopefully you are old enough to remember the dream days at least .`\I think it's because we lack a strong leader. I've been watching Portland play a lot lately, and a big part of their success is how competitive they are.  That all starts out with Damian and the passion that he plays with. He sets the tone, and the rest follow. The Jazz do not have that guy.`\This comment might have worked in the game thread, but this is the post game thread where people pretend like what happened 2 minutes ago was all civil banter.`\Very true. 1:1 AST/TO ratio since joining the Jazz. Not good from your starting PG`\A good coach would have drawn up a play himself instead of asking his stars to do whatever they want. Raps fans have been reluctant to criticize Casey this season, and for good reason, but all these double digit leads that we lose are on him. `\Harden knows how to close games that's for sure`\Sure man whatever makes you feel better about losing after being ahead by 20`\Really dreading our upcoming game against you.`\Damn that was a flop LOL.`\Damn I miss having Beasley. Sorta. `\Harden doesn't dominate the ball and Houston makes a comeback`\Good job`\Not a flop, he hit Neto in the face with the ball. Shouldn't be a foul I don't think, but that's got to hurt.`\Wtf went to get take out for second half and the waitress recognized me even though the only other time I've eaten there was 2 months ago`\Common misconception, crazy how defenders continue to reach on an exceptionally old player`\wow! hand over your Oscar Leo! Harden is the man!`\She was awful.`\What? The dick obviously. That little meat soldier can handle some fuckin pain. I can wrap it around my wrist or twist it like a pigs tail. If you hit it, it takes it as a challenge hulks out and challenges back. (Slapping does hurt, it is skin after all).

Balls are more sensitive than that princess who felt the pea. A slight change in Gravity and one would sell the other to a Saudi in order to stop the torture.

Am I alone in this?`\40 points marvin lets go`\WOOO ALMOST .500 KEEP UP THE GREAT WORK BOYS. ENJOY GETTING RAPED BY GOLDEN STATE :) . HOW DOES IT FEEL TO HAVE PLAYERS THAT DONT EVEN WANT TO BE THERE? ENJOOY YOUR 24 OF HAPPINESS LOSERS. WE'RE 41-20, :) :) :)`\Oh jeez.... `\Free Josh Smith! Lol jk `\You're very welcome, Jazz. `\GET EM NETO`\4 i think`\Hardens been on a scoring tear lately... hopefully this is the game the Rockets can use to turn it around this season.`\Rudy can shoot freethrows when he needs to.

14-1 Houston

I'll go away guys sorry`\Warriors lose to lakers and we win over the raptors, who is your god now /r/nba`\Joking in the NBA subreddit instead of circlejerking. That's a bold strategy Cotton let's see how it pans out.`\they do have a horrible defense, see their DEF EFF. Their steal count is mainly a function of the defensive strategy of trapping and forcing turnovers as opposed to misses. They're willing to let you have open layup and 3's if you're going to give up the ball every once in a while. Any guard who can pass out of the double team is going to destroy this defense, which is most guards in the league.`\http://ftve1200-i.akamaihd.net/hls/live/217050/room106/2628k/prog.m3u8`\Lol seriously. Like undermining what exactly?`\Yeah so what are you getting at?`\WE EXECUTED A FAST BREAK!`\Yes JV! Confident shot!`\Interesting, is this all missed calls or just fouls? There was a two week stretch where the Raps were getting fucked hard, maybe the refs are conscious about it, even becoming favorable to us.

Edit: Hold up this is last 2 minute missed calls, I'd love to see an actual total missed calls. `\Finally a 3`\I remember the days when people thought bazz will be more important to our future than Lavine`\i said it, im doing it damnit`\GOAT POTUS

Reddit's balls will explode and it will cum on itself.`\why did i come here`\He always tries to create more in the first half, but the rest of the team isn't doing shit`\45% to 37%, though the Celtics shot better from 3, or at least less bad.`\HOLY SHIT, AGAIN! Man ref's are so bad at block/charge, neither player was set on either of those calls, even worse Anderson flopped like a fish there. Give me a break.`\maaan, that's my drinking arm`\incredible. love this team`\DE-ROZ!`\Jason Terry, age 38`\Flagrant `\Absolute garbage coaching. Houston shot threes down 3 with a minute and a half left, then took a quick two with under 20 seconds left. Ridiculous.`\different tone after all this girlfriend stuff he's going through. I've been through the same situation and I'd play that pissed off too`\Why do the Wolves take so many long twos and so few three's?`\Yup. 40 points, tied the franchise record for made 3's (10).`\Honestly I don't know how we're still in this game. Credit to Houston's D.`\That was a pretty awesome comment there. Please take my upvote ;)`\It's hard to when you give them a bunch of wide open shots and they either brick it or pass it up. This is not on Kyrie. In my opinion he passed it **too** much tonight.`\He's basically 4th in the depth chart for PGs and this is literally the first game he has shown anything positive. `\Depending on how some players develop, rebuilding most of the roster based off of harden, d-mo, capela, and other young players on the roster seems to make sense. Beverly is on a good contract and fits well next to harden as well.

Ideally they can offload players like brewer and take a chance on one of the the wings on the market, such as Bazemore/Crabbe/Barnes. All three will likely be overpaid but they could also fit nicely next to harden. `\I wish Jae Crowder helped me into my seat.`\He's just a Vin Diesel fan`\It's almost as if basketball is a game of runs`\man, the Cavs just aren't that scary. Down 10 with like 2 and a half minutes to go I would have been 100% confident the Heat were gonna win that game.`\Hubie always picks a side and guns for them.

Does it for the Lakers whenever he happens to commentate their games.`\He needs to have another kid ASAP. `\Both teams getting decent looks... Just nobody can shoot.`\G-TIME 9 points in a row`\Gender equality `\Well yeah, they're cheerleaders `\LETS GO BUCKS `\Almost James `\DID JALEN JUST SAY THAT LMAO`\I miss the old Kanye. `\Rockets obviously`\Not just on the rockets your forgetting gerald henderson Doug McDermott and any former raptor player `\Literally the only play that's been working for the Rockets is that Harden-Dwight for the dunk and we still aren't defending it.`\DMO FOR WHAT?`\If JB puts Brewer on either KLow or DD he's gonna foul out in like 5 minutes`\We might have lost some games in the past, but I'm positive we're gonna win each and every one from now on.`\Hayward keeps getting these superstar calls I don't understand it`\Good double T by DD. Second half Raps been getting fouled consistently and no calls`\When they're doing well they get a little but lax, then the other team comes back and they're like "Oh shit gotta step our game up again" and sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't. Most of the time it seems to work...

Or something like that IDK. `\Me laughing at your guy's shit season means i have only been watching the warriors for two years? Didn't realize shitting on the rockets made me insecure`\I love Trey Lyles`\Jazzbros... We get it. The refs suck. The game hasn't been decided yet. Chill.`\BANKS OPEN `\TREZ TIME`\It's heat of the moment. He was fuming. Usually your teammates will see that and stop you from going too far. He shouldn't of lost it like that, but teammates need to step up.`\At this point I want the whole team snap on the refs and get thrown out, it be funny to watch`\The Jazz showing they can go toe-to-toe with the Cavs when they win the West and meet them in the finals.`\Rose is back, feelsgoodman.`\Morey is definitely an analytics guy, Rockets get so many steals. Steals are just so valuable.

Rockets are so hate-able, but I love the way they play. When they're on, you can see the team they have the potential to be. Still hate you guys though, haha.`\right?i feel like we should be up 10 with all these wide open looks`\SURPRISED RUDYS BALLS DIDNT STOP HIM FROM LEAVING THE GROUND ON THAT PUTBACK`\Let's get the whole team to try and dunk on him during shoot around`\Yeah, but I'm saying it shouldn't be an every play thing, and certainly not down the stretch.`\The two teams that eat the most playa hatin. Cmon Rockets please dont come out asleep on fuckn TNT. `\His defense hasn't been as good in the 2nd half as it was in the 1st half of the season, it's about the only way he's been affected by the rookie wall. `\lol anyone see that bron death stare`\Maybe we shouldn't blame the Cavs and look at Kevin Love. He is not looking too good recently and what more can you ask for then wide open shots?!?`\Sprinkle this clown over a pretzel `\rockets look lethargic right now`\Flagrant 5 - Jaywalking`\flagrant though`\HAHAHAHAHA AND ONE`\Looks loke somebody switched these Raps with the ones from two years ago. Except we might get some clutch 3s from skinny Lowry to save the day.`\They are definitely calling the 2nd half differently. You have to adjust to that as a player though and take the ball to the hoop and the Jazz aren't doing that as well.`\I  know it makes no sense, but every time Chris Johnson scores a basket, I have this stupid feeling that he somehow stole those points from someone else who I like. Least favorite Jazz player since Raja Bell.
`\More lyles`\Goudelock, McDaniels, Some form of Dekker, Smith, and Harrell.

I just wanna see what happens. `\What was that defense `\We need more Lin bubblehead night. Maybe every one home game in playoffs.

Need to make it first though!`\Man that lyles three would've been so nice`\JB, learn when to call a TO, dude.`\what kind of fucking pass was that harden`\Saving this comment cause you just jinx us`\Because we have great food! `\Itd be fine if they werent praising harden all game for doing it hahahaha`\right but rockets legit outplayed us. like i hate that ejection but raps did this to themselves.`\this really isnt a typical line up for them. `\Rebound a missed shot?`\He's a pineapple man.`\"i didn't know Charles was such an apple turnover"

reggie is the corniest fuck ever.`\It seemed reckless yea. Do the refs consider if it looked like a legitimate shot attempt?`\its only bev and harden others are playing well`\I blame jones for this`\HOLY SHIT`\You will finish it in one afternoon. `\wut`\And didnt he have like 20 rebounds`\Ugh come on Bev`\Hi David Locke`\HELLO KJ WELCOME TO THE FUCKING GAME JESUS CHRIST.

LOOKS LIKE U MADE A 3. ID SAY ITS ALMOST TIME FOR YOU TO COME SIT BACK DOWN ON THE BENCH. `\Bucks by 50`\He got 13 in the first and a 4 point play in the second.`\Mavs are not a real team. Doesn't count.`\Who are those fuccbois courtside complaining at every shot and call?`\fucking pat beverly....`\Gg just got rekt`\It must clearly matter, otherwise I don't get why another guy being a moron is affecting you so much. And is it wrong of me to desire smarter people (or at least not potatoes) on a sub I frequent everyday?`\That is very false`\not really, you're just playing against the rockets defense`\What a beautiful play. `\wat`\It's crazy how much worse the Jazz shoot on the road. Wonder what the disparity is compared to other teams.`\bad air conditioning
`\He got a job in the league based on his defense. Every time he starts to slip in an area, he makes up for it in another.  I think a lot of people were surprised we had him starting over Lin a few years back, until they watched the games. He's one of those guys that can be really quiet and not make a huge impact every game, but then he'll just take over and make those plays that steal a game you shouldn't have won.

[This game was when a lot of people started to really take notice he was more than just "that guy who injured Westbrook](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iqX_R6kHHgM)`\Jazz fans complaining about fouls -- Celtics got fucked on 3 iffy calls in last 30 seconds. `\Take your time, no rush.`\Thank you from Jazz fans most of all tho.`\Somebody has to root for us :/ `\Just when you think you can't feel any worse about laughing...`\Turnovers killing us!!

Yikes, don't think that's the right call.
`\we could use a little hayward. hood and favors are playing alright`\That Gobert pass, then zero effort defense pretty much sums up this game.

It's been a disappointing season, but it's way too soon to write him off. `\Has he really been solid? I might be playing stereotypes I guess but he just reminds me of the Delly-type of guy that nobody has faith in but CAN play the game of basketball. `\foh, refs. this is getting obnoxious.`\Only 7 turnovers, +8 rebounds, but yet were only up one because we're shooting 37%. Damn. Fix one thing and another will always break`\For Raptors fans:

You can't let a team shoot 50+% from the field and from 3, then blame the refs when you lose.  That's not how basketball works.  The refs aren't going to close out on shooters for you.`\I've actually only watched 2 animes but I loved both of them.

Death Note and One Piece are both incredibly worth watching....but their pretty popular so you probably already know that.`\I'm pretty sure the Jazz are shooting a higher percentage on 3's than on layups tonight.`\Straight up lol wow `\THE HYPE TRAIN IS BACK ON TRACK!!!! WHERE YOU BEEN ALL YEAR, CLINT?!?`\That's Michael "MVP" Beasley`\It's great to see what Lee can do now that he's adapted to our offensive system`\Didn't know that about the corner 3.
