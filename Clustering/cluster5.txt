You have no idea. At least I have 30 years of evidence that I've cited. Dwight Howard (because of Kobe) and LaMarcus Alridge are the only two examples that you can point to. Everyone who's connected seems to point to LA still having clout. There's no reason to believe otherwise unless you know something specific the rest of the world doesn't.

>Not to mention Kobe is leaving

Some think this is a good thing and FA are now more likely to come. I'm not so sure, but it's plausible.

>I don't see them getting stars cheap anymore unless something changes IMO

Why? Out of all teams in the league who have traded for a star, the Lakers come up a vastly disproportional amount of times. Rox got Harden, Knicks got Melo, Cavs got Love. Clips got Paul (after Lakers deal was voided, btw). I'm probably missing a couple of others. Lakers have gotten Nash (was an aging star when they got him, but still he forced way to LA), Dwight (only Brooklyn was competitive), Pau (No less than Coach Pop complained about this deal being unfair). If Boogie says, I want to be in LA, he can dampen his market. Celts won't overpay if Boogie doesn't want to be there.

Sticking IMO at the end doesn't mean you can make baseless assertions without any reasoning to back it up. `\Hey Peja, thanks for the AMA

That gives you a young core of Clarkson, Hield, Ingram, Randle, WCS heading in to the new arena.

Yes all of the players suck (except maybe WCS) but at least you can pretend to your fanbase that you have a young core for the future. They have low expectations for "hope". `\JW has been quiet tonight.

Sometimes it's Sean Tuohy and he is pretty bad.`\Boogie with 7 of those`\I'm shocked how bad we are.... We have no heart..`\i dont`\Yes. The reason I picked #16 is because it was my first number when I played in Europe. The numbers that people could play with were only #4-15. So when I was 13, I joined a team at a local club in town and I was the youngest on the team and they gave me #16. Someone literally asked to print the number 16 and I went with it.`\Thank you Sacramento`\To Boogie every call against us is a bad call. Kinda tired of him pouting up and down the court every game.`\But they were flipping out last year at the idea of an Cousins for Okafor/Russell trade (which probably also included Randle/Clarkson). The idea was treasonous. Now Cousins is 1 year older and has 1 less year remaining on his contract.

I saw Rondo call Rudy over to help him with defense like three times this game which all lead to the Pistons scoring. And he is usually the one that is off his man which causes so many open threes for the enemy team. If you really focus on him for a game you can easily see this happening. `\cousins and rondo to join blake in clippers uniform

Hey James, you suck farts dude!`\We're not a good basketball team.`\I tire of his inability to focus. He gets too caught up in that kind of stuff and let's affect his focus all the time. It's hard to win like that and his attitude does seem to affect the team as a whole. As good as Boogie is I think he'd benefit from being second fiddle to someone somewhere. `\Everrrrybody needs a good feet!`\Brb buying WCS jersey`\"Barea took it right in the throat" - Jerry Reynolds`\Sean is thirsty as fuck...`\What mistake? One was drafted, the other was traded for. And don't take it literally. By live or die with him, I mean we will ride his contract until the end. `\we suck sooooooo bad`\It depends on where the pick landed.  Lets say after the draft lottery the Suns end up with the #1 or #2 pick. They then make that draft day trade for Boogie. That isn't a bad deal.  It meets both short-term and long-term goals for the Kings.  Keep in mind, the Kings aren't trading Boogie because they *want* to, but because they feel they *have* to.  Those deals never, ever, give the team trading the star the moon.  Just consider what went for Kevin Love. At the time, he was as good, unique, and valuable as Boogie is now.

* Cleveland got: Kevin Love

* Philly got: 2015 Heat pick, Mbah a Moute, Shved

* Minny got: Andrew Wiggins, Anthony Bennett, and Thad Young

Sorry, but that proposed trade for Boogie would net a significantly better hall.  Brandon Knight is currently better than anyone Minny got. While Wiggins will be better eventually than Knight, will he be better than Ben Simmons or Brandon Ingram? Simmons has and has had as much hype as Wiggins did coming out of high school.  Oddly enough, a lot their issues entering the draft are similar. The addition of Brandon Knight makes that trade clearly better.

As I said, it also meets with both their short-term and long-term goals. In the short term, they're entering a new arena and would like to win now.  If they can't win now, they would at least like something for Kings fans to be excited about.  A hyped up young prospect along with a talented guard meets both short term goals. Long term, it gives them two young players to grow and develop together. Further, Knight and Simmons have complementary skill-sets.  It also solves all the headaches Boogie has caused.  I think it makes them a better team immediately and heading into the future.

It would be a mega-win for Sacramento.  If you think that is a steal for Phoenix, you must be living in Colorado because you're high as fuck.`\hey man you came at me with the "don't give me that bullshit" stuff first, you established the tenor of the conversation so don't cry when I give it back to you. Cousins remained loyal, that's a nice way to try and frame it but the truth is more like, teams were scared to gamble on him because he's a toxic mess.

You need a culture, preferably a selfless one, which starts at the very top with Mr. Nic "Cherrypicker" Stauskas...rocks.

Pop and Bob Myers are pretty open about what will breed success, but fuckasses like Morey and others continue to think they know everything.

Malone may not have been the one to take the Kings to the promised land, but he could have been vital to the development of Boogie's game and maturity and maybe even make a decent role player out of McLemore, all the while creating an environment that free agents and draft picks want to be apart of. I mean I think he's done a pretty good job with the Denver kids.

Then you bring that elite coach in to finish the job.

`\It's not THAT unfair of a comparison though.

If they're along the same lines, I'd keep him on the team; if they differ greatly, then I'd let Cousins know I'll be trading him in the near future.

In the meantime, I'd try to sign Rondo to a 3 year deal that doesn't completely break the bank; somewhere in the 15 million dollar per year range. If he balks at that, then I'll let Collison step into the starting role and look to get Seth Curry signed to be the back-up.

In regards to some things that generally get overlooked, I'd look to completely retool my scouting department by poaching a high-ranking scout in the Spurs/Celtics organization and give them free-reign over the scouting/hiring process. I would also try very hard to get Layne Vashro on as a draft consultant as his player profiles and player models have been of the highest quality over the years with a very solid success rate. I'd also hire Zig Ziegler as a training consultant if not the full-blown head trainer position.

Lastly, the head coaching position. Though there are a handful of coaches that I would be fine with hiring, the two at the top of my list would have to be Shaka Smart and David Blatt. Shaka is a very intelligent coach who is very well respected and loved among both his peers and players for his intensity as well as his Basketball IQ. He would be my number one choice and I would throw a good amount of money his way to try to pry him away from Texas. If that fails, I will go for Blatt and give him my word that I would not undermine him as coach since I believe that was his biggest problem in Cleveland.

After that, we would see how the draft goes and ultimately how Cousins plays/feels with the new team. If all else fails, I would try to move him and go with a youth movement based around our newly appointed HC.`\Foul*`\I read this at first as "steph curry was responsible for 9/11".`\Sorry, what would have made it clear if you were not being so trusting??`\I like the part where we choke our lead `\How many fucking times did that ball circle the rim`\That trade is still unbelievable.  `\One game closer to Wittman being gone, maybe.

 DMC, with his current, attitude on almost any other franchise wouldn't be a problem. You have to factor in the toll of constantly losing, constantly having poor coaches and poor management. People are using this to single out DMC and giving the King's organization a pass. You think anything will change once DMC is gone? They'll still be a shit team and draft another star hopeful who will most likely get fed up with the Kings constant inner turmoil and want to leave too.

Cousin's attitude is a product of him being a natural hot head and the environment, and one of those is more easily changeable than the others. [[Continued...]](http://www.resavr.com/comment/sacramento-bee-journalist-goes-3012337)

He runs hot, but is also smart enough to know when to keep his cool. I see Boogie taking 10 seconds to get back on defense because he's too busy whining to the refs, which is detrimental to the team. I've seen it in close games.

The difference between Boogie and Green is that Green is the cocky loud mouth who does it to get under peoples skin. Boogie just seems to lose his cool.

I haven't had the opportunity to catch a Mav game in awhile`\Well considering we'd have to give up a ton of assets to get him, yes, he would completely ruin our team and make us into the Kings East. And even if we magically got him for free I still think he'd make our team worse. Our defense would absolutely go to shit, and he's pretty inefficient so he would not help or offense either.

they're probably a contender imo. what kerr did was obviously amazing but steph and klay and green made huge individual leaps. they were a 51-win team in jackson's last year and i don't think anyone thought they'd peaked

Diaw for Boban`\What does that even mean?`\https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGD4xLGILzs`\I think his points per game would go up, assists would go down, and rebounds would stay the same.

Blazers weren't even supposed to be in the playoffs, so I can't complain about our season at all.

Right now the Blazers combined as a team only have 12 techs this season and Cousins has 15 by himself.  The way the Blazers interact with the refs these days its like Paul Allen is trying to ward off the ghost of Rasheed Wallace or something. `\Well maybe a winning environment can change someone. I'd be upset playing for Sacramento with like 8 coaches over 7 years and never winning, no offence.`\Fuck me, right?`\Winning cures a lot. And I think he can bring out the best in AD. They are already so competitive. `\no. The Kings need to sell tickets. A new owner, new arena, 2017 rebranding. Kings need some star power and can trade for one with Boogie as a trade chip. Blake Griffin & Deandre (lob city for boogie?). I mean they could with Orl for pieces, but then who's their star player Vucivic? If they were going to trade and "rebuild" Boston would be a better trade partner. Brooklyn pick (ben simmons) + 1-2 unprotected + filler. Kings could market Ben Simmons, but a trade wouldn't happen until after the draft lottery.`\Fuck this dude the only reason why I still tune in every game is to watch Russell play. Now with Williams the fucking ballhog is back Byron Mr Potatohead cut his minutes by like 10 from 35 to 25 mpg at this rate. I could give two shits if Marcelo plays. I don't tune in to watch the 32 year old rookie even though he makes us better who gives a shit in a 14-53 season. Play fucking Russell a lot, I look over to Phoenix and see Booker play 40 mpg. I'm not saying play Russell that much but at least a consistent 33-35 a game would be nice.`\Those scrubber girls are doin work.`\I know I'm hating a lot here but recently Boogie has really hurt ball movement and energy when he comes out in the second half. The team just defers to him, he attacks the rim, eventually doesn't get a call and loses it. He starts making worse passes, taking worse shots, and playing less defense. I really think it's time the Kings take a new direction. It's obviously not all Boogies fault or even mostly his fault, but I think moving him would be beneficial for both parties. This place has been too frustrating for everyone.`\almost as much as David West`\Nice, Crabbe hitting his first shot is a good sign. `\Except we literally have no other assets to trade. Unless the Kings would take a package of Kyle O'Quinn and Vujacic`\If Beal wasn't made of glass I think I might like this trade,`\Good one dude`\yo we fucking suck`\scott's magic offensive set wasnt run since that game for some reason`\190 IQ geniuses think alike `\He seems like a tough player to ref, hes so strong and physical that you almost have to call a foul on every play but no one wants to do that. But if you don't then it's going to be an ugly game`\As opposed to putting basketball first. Team has been two different owners' little chemistry sets.

If they did the simple job of recognizing the type of talent they have or need, and how to play ball in accordance to that talent then the team would be much further along. `\First time all month we have consecutive home games. Hope we're finally getting some rest.`\The Mavs not taking a shot makes up for Marco not taking the shot at the end of the 1st`\Byron must really hate Nick Young lol..`\Time for an overhaul. Trade Cousins and start a new era in Sactown. I know it's hard to give up on a star player but damn, it's time already. Even if he has big success elsewhere I think it's better to sell high and load up for the future.`\idk, it looked to me like he was trying too hard to get blocks. He didn't get a goaltend this game, but he could have and that really would have lowered his RPM. `\"Whats that?  Every replay shows it's a legal score?  TAKE THE POINTS OFF THE BOARD CAN'T HAVE THAT!"`\oh wow, I had no idea. That's pretty messed up. `\i hope one day someone can love me like jim loves gorgui`\Kings without Boogie? Might be a murder`\I'm watching and I haven't seen any bad calls. That blocking foul that Parsons got on Boogie could have gone the other way, he hit him right in the face.`\mentions Rubio and Flynn, but not the dude picked after them...`\ah gee I guess we'll take him... redemption for getting rid of ZBo right before he got his act together `\Haha that dude who flinched and recoiled into his chair in anticipation of the KAT slam.`\You guys really shouldn't get your hopes up. Yes, you have a lot of picks, but none of them are going to be good enough to snag Boogie, barring something crazy happening like the Nuggets and Knicks both jumping into the top 2.

As far as roster pieces go, the only guy you have under contract that the Kings would be interested in is Kyle Lowry, and you're not trading him.

I see Raptors fans bring up Valanciunas all the time, but why the hell would the Kings want him?!? He's a poor man's version of what we already have! He plays less than 30 mpg for you guys. He's never going to be an All Star, and he's not that young. Is he good? Of course. But he's not a guy that you center a package around for a Top 10 player.

And don't even get me started on Terrance Ross, or any other spare parts you have laying around on the bench.`\Lol of course Boogie is way better than Simmons, who said that?

But it's all about cost, control, and potential. If (big if) we draft Simmons, we have him cost controlled for 4 years, and then we have him under a semi-reasonable contract for another 4 years.

Simmons is definitely far from a sure thing based on his shooting, so yes I agree right now, he's a tweener (is this still an issue?) that can't shoot. But who says he can't learn how to shoot in the next couple of years after he's drafted. Also more to you point about him being a tweener, some of the best players in the NBA are 'tweeners'.

Players aren't called that anymore because traditional positions have generally been thrown out. Simmons is a wing that can play on the perimeter and in the post. He's a gifted passer with exceptional court vision. He handles the ball very well, runs the break great, rebounds the ball great, and can guard over multiple positions.

If Brad Stevens ever got his hands on Simmons, he would probably transform him into a Lebron Lite player (Remember, Lebron can't shoot either, and he's turned out pretty good lol).`\Kings have wonky incentives here. Giving up the pick next year would bring the Stepien Rule into effect and ensure they give up an unprotected 2019. Better to give it up this year instead of next unless you think they will be bottom 10 next year but outside the bottom 10 the year after that. It's a complex situation.`\With a few moves I think they could have both. Addition by subtraction by getting rid of Karl and Boogie.

If they could get Simmons for Boogie, that would be nice. Philly would also be worth looking at as a trade destination, but not sure they have the right mix of guys if the Kings also want to be good this year. But I bet Sac town fans show up for the new arena either way, so getting a guy like Simmons would be best of both worlds. `\Sixth pick would be great...`\Bonner missed, now we have to cut him. `\Lmfao he actually thinks otherwise, what a dumbass`\Thanks for the sacrifice`\We can be sad together.`\It's gotten a little better but he still has a lot of room for improvement. During the cavs game last night there were soooo many times that he made a mistake, which is fine, but then proceeded to walk back down the court with his head down. Kings management is trash, but boogie needs to sack the fuck up, quit whining, and be the beast that he can be.  As frustrating as it probably is to come into the league and not play on a contender, you get paid millions of dollars to play a game, so acting like a toddler is fucking stupid. `\Wtf is rondo doing grabbing Davis lol`\Plz, my heart can't take that`\Did Andre even jump on that jumpshot?`\I'm not even a Kings fan and I don't know how George Karl has a job. I watched them play the Spurs and Karl flat out tanked that game in the third quarter.`\sam mitchell is not good at his job`\the god damn starters are so good`\The smart thing would be to try to get Nik Stauskas in a trade. Stauskas?!? Stauskas?!?`\Kendrick "I literally crossed myself over" Perkins entered the game`\And you can have that opinion.

IMO it's pretty delusional to say if you were the Lakers' GM and Vlade called you asking for Russell for Cousins straight up, that you would say no.

I bet if you polled all 30 GMs though, you wouldn't get one GM that would agree with you on that one.

`\Who has a decent stream pls? I've checked nbastreams`\Who? `\I laughed and laughed when Collison lost the ball. Because how else would the Kings execute at the end of the game? I feel nothing anymore.`\What are the options here man? What potential trade exists that makes your team better? He's one of a few top tier players that exist in the league

Your options are to keep and work around him or give him up and go completely into obscurity. You play the hand you're dealt. You're lucky to have him, not the other way around. There's really no universe where trading away the one elite player one your team makes you better by default, you need a plan `\I see. It does look bad. Do you guys still want to keep Cousins or do you think he's a lost cause at this point?`\Dude, you guys are missing quite a few players...I'd be more concerned if this was the third game with the same lineup, but not the first.`\first bit of emotion from anybody`\Kinda funny from a thunder fan`\thanks for the insight. i watch quite a bit of portland, and crabbe always looks pretty good out there`\tip-off went pretty well`\i think harkless was out of bounds when he hit that originally but whatever. that was nice hustle. `\Holy shit these refs...`\27/11 are superstar stats.


he average this year is the same as Durants career mark and higher than Curry's MVP season... he's a superstar`\Oh? I don't remember hearing Jordan ask to be traded, be league leader in tech, complaining about ref, complaining about t shirts, or trying to get his coach fired. Also, love the perpetual notion that Jordan had a bunch of off the court issues. Exactly what are those issues? A story that he didn't sign carmillionaire's shoes? A story that he's the bad tipper? So the fuck what? Or are you referring to him loving to gamble? Is that really a problem? I mean it would be if he's broke or in debt. But last I heard, he's a billionaire.

So come again at why you think Boogie is compatible to Jordan or anyone else you mentioned?`\WTF Troy`\Fuck this new guy, we don't need to cut anyone`\Damn I laughed  `\Original`\Too many extra passes.`\Geez, Boban is yuuge. `\"You don't have to be rich and famous to shop at Shareef's!"`\Love the effort Crabbe!`\Celtics owner Wyc Grousbeck has said "No prima donnas" and "No drama ". Does that sound like they want Cousins?`\James Andersons starting gg pels, was fun while it lasted`\How is that ironic?`\If only he could learn from your wisdom, /u/StephCurryIsGay`\Where do you see Boogie being a bad teammate?

Genuinely curious because it always leads to him being called a bad teammate, but he got in trouble for yelling at Karl....a coach who was going to be fired a month ago, but we decided we didn't want an interim coach for the rest of the year.

I have never heard teammates of Boogie saying he's a problem.`\You can give that to houston`\.1% is still a percent. `\I think he was asking about the one before`\oh man, this is not looking good.`\Right wtf, this shit sounds fantastic`\We won?????`\Fix the front office, remove any toxic elements and build a real scouting department that's capable of drafting useful players, in addition to a coaching staff that can develop them. Either trade Boogie if you can get more than one lottery pick in the next couple drafts, or use Boogie as a marketing tool to generate interest in the team for the next couple years until we have draft picks again. `\Don't forget about Budapest!`\I can't argue with the WCS projection. I think he'll be solid. And I think he fits next to Boogie (which also plays into NOT trading Boogie).

McLemore though.. I dunno. KCP went right after him, and McCollum two picks after that. Also worth mentioning: Giannis went 8 picks later and Schroder two picks after that. A LOT of solid players after McLemore (who I still think has potential, but the players listed after him have shown considerably more, at this point). `\playing PF is tiring af`\He's been scoring like 14 ppg on sub 40% shooting since December man. This isn't just a post ASB thing.`\I mean I for sure agree with that. We need a total overhaul as it can't be an exclusive oh Demarcus needs to change or the front office needs to change. All of it needs to change if we expect to do anything anytime soon`\I'd trade the 2 brooklyn picks (not this year), mavs pick, and maybe sullinger for boogie this summer. Boston will still have the 2019 Memphis pick which is looking like it could be really valuable with the grizzlies core really getting old

But seeing Boogie play his heart out for nothing is beginning to wear on me.

His coach offers zero fucking support and is totally checked out. The talent around him is questionable at best, the front office hasn't helped him...

I just want the Kings to do marginally well at this point.`\lol refs`\I don't argue about his numbers. There is a lot of dysfunction in the team management and coaching staff. The team is a mess. However, cousins is the only constant in the last 5-6 seasons or so. Cousins brings the entire team and organization down with his attitude every night. He leads the league in technical fouls, he gets one more and he's suspended for another game. Just because he's really good doesn't make him a valuable asset to the team.`\To be fair Garnett was simply just better than Boogie is, and the Wolves were a lot more stable than the Kings have been, and they had a few seasons where Garnett had better teammates than anything Boogie has had.

2. You in your prime vs. Curry this year who wins an all star weekend style three point competition?

He was much much much more disciplined during the Kings winning streak at the start of 2016 and when they managed to grab the 8th seed for a little bit, but as soon as the losing started again, he began to lose his cool. It also doesn't help that Karl plays Boogie iso ball in the paint where he constantly gets mugged by at least two defenders and can't get the ball up for a shot, that's when he complains to the ref and doesn't get back on defense. He (and the rest of the team) play the best ball when Cousins has somebody else on the floor that can score consistently. Rudy has been that player for the Kings for stretches, but not consistently. Rondo is great at dishing the ball, but he can't score. WCS/Acy have limited offensive games, none of our shooting guards have been able to score.

>first round picks, which are viewed as much more valuable than players with established ceilings

This I don't follow exactly. It's debatable how much Randle/Clarkson can develop. So no need to argue here. But I disagree that ANY first round pick is worth more than either player.

The nets future picks might be high, but they might also be middle of the pack. The celts picks would be low. high teens at best, probably in the 20's, especially with Boogie. So no, I don't think those picks are worth either Clarkson or Randle. Randle and Smart are probably of similar value. Clarkson may be less, but not substantially less. Celts nor lakers would take a pick in the teens for any of them, and probably not even two picks for randle or Smart.

The nets pick this year is very valuable, but in a range that will be determined before a trade. I don't think the Celts trade the first pick for Cousins, plus all of what you said. If it's the 5th pick, sure.

But he hasnt been doing it that good long enough to be in the superstar convo. I know a lot of casual NBA fans who wouldn't even be able to tell you what team he plays for. I'd call him a future superstar. `\The Kings are still dispelling all the poison that came with Mullin and D'Allessandro, and unfortunately George Karl hasn't been great either. I would not be surprised at this point if Karl is trying to get fired so he can make his final paycheck and retire.

Karl never came to Sacramento to help develop Boogie and the team into something special long-term. He came to Sacramento as a favor from D'Allessandro & Mullin when they were still consulting with the team, tried to blow up the team as soon as he arrived so he could get a few more wins on his career total, and tried to make a final stand on the King's dime and time.

Yes, ultimately Vivek and the ownership group is responsible for these decisions, but when he brings in a tenured, veteran front office guy like D'Allessandro and he just shits the bed on a massive scale, it's hard to turn back on Vivek and blame him for that as well. When Vivek tries to be hands-on and makes hires himself like Mike Malone, he gets killed in the media for being a 'new owner' who doesn't know what he's doing, and when he hires a long-time NBA front office guy he gets killed for 'running a shitty organization'. I think people should be more fair to Vivek - his hire was the best move the organization has made in the last few years... He just hired the wrong 'experts'.`\Well of course.

What's more Sacramento than the Kings getting btfo every game by the hometown kid?`\Great deflection bro! The same FBI are the ones that busted Donaghy and made it public in the first place.`\I could agree.

Personally I'm just not a fan of Randle or Clarkson (or Ingram), so I'm just looking at it as an opportunity to get some value out of them while people haven't yet figured out that they aren't good. `\thanks for proving my point`\nope. we worry that if we tank we lose boogie`\A good coach keeps his troops motivated. What we saw in the Wizards the last two nights was anything but inspired play. `\FREE RED MAMBA`\Such a foul`\owellzzzz.. gg. knew it was gonna be an exciting game`\I mean you trade Cousins to retool through the draft.

They could definitely grab some assets as well as a #1 overall or close. `\Rudy Gay is defending Kawhi well `\Sure, perhaps Cousins is more valuable than Russell in a vacuum, but you also have to take into account the team and where it was.

I think trading Russell for Cousins would put a ceiling on how good the team could be, since the team wouldn't have any other players to build around. It would kind of be like the Carmelo Knicks.

This year, it's different, since we would have an extra year of tanking. Which is why I would do a similar deal with Ingram. `\rip Kawhi's quest for 50/40/90 :p`\Typo on 1st for scoring, 3rd and 4th for assists.

Seriously though. Cousins and WCS is a permanent two-way solution. They will be just about the best interior in the NBA for the next decade if they stay together. Rondo and Collison are both permanent PG solutions. Keep one, move the other. The Kings' five most-played lineups all have a positive +/-. Their problem is the bench. Collison is an above-average starting PG on a comically cheap deal. If they keep Rondo, they could get multiple great rotation players in exchange for him.

But yeah, he is like a senile, angry Grandpa.`\They were locked in the second they shut AD down`\too many things on. im tryna watch this, okc-clips, and the dem debate all at the same time lol`\Thanks buddy.`\It might be Butler but I hope not`\Get fucking Parker out.`\Just move a couple hours down here man. You won't regret it I promise`\Me too. I mean I look fairly young for being 27, so I can spare like a decade.

Also screw George Karl and James Anderson is worse live than on TV.`\Talk to the owner about moving the team to Seattle`\And then Wall makes a 3.`\I think he's been talking too much to /u/GeorgeKarlIsGay`\So when the hell is Burks coming back?

What where the thoughts going through your head when you hit your [ridiculous game winner](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7amY31lSSk) against Detroit in 2004?`\Say what you will about the guy, but he kept me watching.`\Caron sighting??`\It was special`\Their schedule really really helps in a frustrating way.`\Well that's another 30+pt first quarter. At least we're not trailing by much`\So Rondo doesnt give a shit this game`\Every team fighting for the playoffs is winning games, fuck this is gonna be intense. D Rose looked real good tonight.`\The Suns. `\KLOVE I HATE YOU......................................when its convenient `\Will cj be a jazz man next year?`\I don't know man. I feel like Boogie is almost interchangeable with Dwight Howard in this context. People thought Dwight just needed to be under a respectable coach with veteran teammates that wouldn't take his shit, and as it turns out that didn't work too well.`\I think he really put in the work this year. never seen him so ripped and he's playing with so much energy. I'm jealous tbh`\No one tried to make a play on it?  Cousins was wrestling two or three guys for the rebound, and when it went on the floor, there were at least three guys, including Rondo, diving for the ball.`\To everyone claiming moving Cousins would be detrimental - how much worse could it get really. Talking about "rebuilding" - the Kings have been mired in sub-.400 basketball the last ten years. Obviously something isn't working. And if they keep moving personnel while Cousins stays and they're still losing 50 games every year - maybe it's the not the moving personnel that's the problem. And this isn't hate on Boogie but he's not completely absolved of responsibility here. I say trade him and let both he and the Kings move on. `\12th pick... yummy.`\So have the kings.`\lmao rondo's postgame`\COME ON KINGS`\Can I just give Manu the rest of my youth? I'll only waste it watching him anyways. `\No chemistry at all so far for the cavs`\I will say that I'm glad that this season is done, pace and space doesn't really work with the personnel we have, its almost like we tried to force a square peg in a round hole with the new type of offense and it really hasn't worked so far. `\Did have. That rebound pile was the end of it. Can't let that happen.`\I seriously hope Dirk finds his shot soon`\>2) Lakers always get the deal. They do not overpay.

4 Draft Picks for Steve Nash `\Dude, thats sad.`\[chalmers](http://puu.sh/nuZRN/b3d58ed5bc.png)`\oh definitely dont have the assets to get him...especially since were still hurting from Isaiah trading away all our draft picks all the friggin time.

That was Strong!`\Derrick Rose was the best player on the court tonight and more people need to know about it`\Dje si, sta ima?`\Yeah but have they ever had more than 30 wins since Cousins was drafted?

No.`\You think someone will trade a lottery pick for Gay? I don't think so`\Trade Boogie to the Celtics for players/picks (I'm gonna assume something like Marcus Smart, Terry Rozier, and James Young as the players) that would include a Brooklyn pick (2016), the Dallas pick (most likely this year), and a 2018 Celtics first rounder.

Lose Rondo via free agency to create cap space (Rondo had 9 million dollar contract). Trade Rudy Gay to a playoff team/playoff contention team that could maybe use a wing like the Rockets/Hawks/Wizards (honestly not sure) for a late lottery pick.

Go into the draft, draft BPA with their 2-3 lottery picks this year (Brooklyn pick should be top 5, their own pick is likely between 5-10)

Also- Julius Randle needs to learn to pass. He's not LeBron in transition, and until he consistently shows that he can finish a damn layup, either the coaching staff or someone with a little bit of clout on the team needs to tell him to give it up.

It would be such a Kings move to fire yourself.`\Oladipo, always stealing rebounds from the bigs.`\cuz kings`\Curry could shoot 50 threes against this team because they've no defense at all. `\Lou is a blackhole most of the time, and when he has an open shot due to being a spot shooting position, he opts to wait for the defender to recover to attempt drawing fouls instead of shooting the wide open shot!

Randle is also a blackhole most of time.  He just doesn't want to pass when he should! I doubt this would be an issue if he was on the Spurs or something.  However, our "coach" seems unable to persuade players to play the right way.  I'm giving Byron the benefit of the doubt, because coaches get blamed way more than players IMO.

From Byron's perspective, sure Lou isn't moving the ball, but when he's in he gets points way more consistently.  As for Kobe, it's his last year, and we want to let him go out his way as gratitude.  This year was never going to be playoffs obviously, but at the same time, we can't look like we are purposely losing either.

Lou is okay in short spurts where you have him as the offense and everyone else there for rebounds and defense just to give the starters a short break.  A way to hold the lead for a while.  However, if you're trying to win a full game through Lou, it isn't going to happen with how he attempts to draw fouls all the time.

JR needs to finish at a high clip if he is that intent on charging into multiple defenders.  The many times I have seem him totally miss open layups T_T`\Bonner showing why we should keep him`\PEJA!

But I can't say for certain. I'm pretty sure we can convey a pick from 11-30 to Philly in 2018 because it means the Chicago pick will not be conveyed.

Do you have anything specific from the rule that claims that this will happen? When you look at future draft picks, it agrees with what I'm describing.

But earlier this year he was on his feet majority of games actually showing some type of interest in the team. He now barely shows any emotion to what is going on, and that's obviously going to irritate someone like Cousins who is an overload of emotions when on the court.

I've been on good basketball teams and bad basketball teams. There's a difference when your teammate is yelling at you in both situations.

If Boogie was on the Warriors and just came off a title season and was about to break an NBA record for the best regular season ever it would be far different.

Blazers were top 5 in ORtg and DRtg before Wes went down. They were 2nd or 3rd in the west and had one of the top 3 starting lineups by multiple metrics.

Blazers would actually be fucking stacked if he came back. Their only weakness was the bench.

PG: Lillard, McCollum

SG: Wes, Hendo, PatConn

SF: Aminu, Crabbe (or keep Batum and have no Aminu, Crabbe, Vonleh)

PF: Aldridge, Vonleh, Leonard

C: Lopez, Plumlee

People will call me a homer, but that's a top 3 team right behind Warriors and Spurs.

Do you ever there will be a team there again?`\All season long, dude is a monster`\they have him under contract and I wouldnt trade him untill he wants out because you wont get someone as good as him back and draft picks are a huge gamble

at best you get something like the wolves where you luck into a good pick (KAT) and get something in return (wiggins) but if you get fucked with the draft you end up being like the 6ers. 3+ years of shit basketball and uncertain if any of the guys drafted will pan out`\This seems... unnecessarily hostile.`\I'm sure they'd want picks more than players, but the problem with trading good players for draft picks is that you usually still have to find a way to take some guys back in order to make the salaries work out. Plus, Rudy Gay is pushing 30 so the teams most curious about him would likely only offer picks that are outside of the lottery anyway. As you said, I think to have any real shot at great picks you'd have to be willing to give up Cousins.`\Maybe he's too quick for Boban.`\That doesn't absolve rondo of blame `\I love it, such a fucking sick beat, but I'm into trap music.

`\Well there is always next year! IIRC next year's draft is deeper too.`\Only if I got to fuck his bitch too `\This is just terrible basketball`\I think they'll move him.

Sure, he had character issues that hurt our team but at that point we weren't going to go very far in the playoffs anyways `\Cavs perimeter defense is so bad. And they are too slow to recover. Yikes.

Why the fuck does Richard Jefferson get any playing time either? Jesus `\Oh yeah, the end of the season schedule is just ridiculous, but there is hope that some of those teams, especially the Spurs, go into rest mode and don't field a full line up giving us a shot at some wins in those games.`\Rolo has been really good for us... like exceeded expectations good.  Our front court is set.  The backcourt is the problem.`\30 wins.  Sit down, haters.`\So how are we going to beat OKC?`\Justin Anderson does some stupid shit like turning the ball over and goaltending, then he does an amazing drive and assist. Then he gets fakes the shit out of by a white guy 3 times in a row on the same play lol`\Did you fuck Sienna West? `\> I'm just talking about in terms of his value as a prospect. 23 is young, but as far as the NBA is concerned he basically is what he is at this point.

I think a lot of people would disagree with you on this.

As for Boogie's trade value, I think people understand the writing on the wall for Sacramento. I don't think he is getting a Carmelo to the Knicks type of deal regardless of what occurs. People are much smarter about protecting assets now than they were 2 or 3 years ago.

As for the Raptors trading for Boogie, even with the cap rising we would have to give too much to match salary I think as we aren't giving up Lowry / DeRozan / Carroll / Joseph in that deal. We would moreso be dangling the knicks/nuggets at draft night. And we want a 4, really, which this deal doesn't really help and probably makes us even worse at.`\Because apparently before Karl came out and said nobody was untradeable he had been talking to teams behind the front office's back to see what he could get for Boogie... He & D'Allessandro were trying to flip the script and bring in some of 'their guys' once Karl realized it wasnt gonna work out with Boogie ( which was probably right after the summer-league Fiasco right off the bat) `\Thank Wade`\Nah this isn't convincing to me`\Him balling out for the Mavs in 2011. That's a glimpse of how he feels lol`\also a coach killer that people seem to give him a pass for`\> And just need Lillard to hit his prime like Curry has.

I...I wouldn't count on that.`\Yes. Nowhere he has played has he been considered a locker room cancer. Even in Dallas it was reported that he was well liked amongst the players. `\NO!!!!!!!!!!!!

I was trying to make a point how every year there are multiple occasions in a draft where years later a team could have drafted a much better player after knowing how they turn out.`\let's play this way for the whole game, ok?`\shitty shitty call`\because boogie walks faster then he runs`\wow`\manu post up, he's feelin it`\The "get the rebounds" position against us, apparently.  `\We're gunna end up winning out and getting the 12th pick or something like that just because I want a rookie so badly.

Cousins is a superstar. None of those guys are. Ingram hasn't proved anything in league yet.

And even worse when that statement is completely logical. `\Both of DMC's arms were being held back on that free throw attempt.`\I'm glad this gamethread was made so late, this has been horrible to watch for a Lakers fan.

Them needing to tank this year, kobe's farewell tour, and the instability in their system make that a bad trade to get cousins amidst all of that. If they were in the Celtics position as a playoff team with and established coach and a strong front office, I think they would take that deal.

I guess I'm trying to say the package is a good deal but the circumstances were not. The Celtics circumstances are better for a boogie trade so a similar package makes sense. Plus, at some point th Celtics are just going to have too many guys and trading IT, smart or crowder and the pick allows you to see what your u have in young, hunter, rozier, and creates room for all the future assets you still have.

We've seen high motor / effort players on bad teams get frustrated many times in the past. Look at what happened with Markieff Morris yelling at Goodwin for poor effort just a few weeks ago. It's not that unusual.`\not a win that makes you feel particularly good. whatever. i guess ill take it`\And not George Karl as their coach.`\I'll take 1 Boogie too`\This idiot will never change`\we beat the sixers by like five and they still have a worse team than you without boogie, etc especially since they didn't play okafor and noel so I'd guess we're gonna win by like five in a stupidly close game. `\Like this?`\Damn`\Rondo's passes are a joy to watch.  Perfect timing.`\yeah that was vigorous`\I'm sorry, but  blowing a defensive possession because you were whining about a no-call has nothing to do with management or coaching.  It's an inexcusable personality defect.  Every player in the NBA should know that the refs make plenty of mistakes and miss plenty of calls, but you can't sacrifice your defense spending time whining about every no-call.  The fact that he thought somehow it was not only justifiable, but he also got infuriated with his coach over it, just shows that Boogie's not willing to do what it takes to win.  `\Thtas some major cringe material`\Gortat DESTROYED Cousins last time these teams met, to the point Cousins probably contemplated retirement.  I look for Boogs to have a big game tonight in a spirited Kings victory.`\The refs`\Kawhi is only 6 ASTs from a trip dub, hope he can pick up his first today!`\Disband the Kings`\Hey look an open DLO or Clarkson at the 3 and Nance is behind you.


Nah let's take a contested shot in front of 3 Kings players.


Fuck his tunnel vision`\Agreed. Honestly though, I imagine Portland would have to at least give up McCollum in order to get Boogie. But if I'm Portland I'm willing to make that sacrifice; Lillard and McCollum (slightly) marginalize eachother's potential since they play similar positions and with similar styles of play, while Boogie would be the force in the middle that they desperately need`\It could be worse.

"IF YOU DON'T LIKE THAT, YOU DON'T LIKE NBA BASKETBALL"`\Kyrie really looks like he's starting to get into the groove of things now, still wish we saw a few more assists and bench points though`\Oh trust me I know. Sad recognize sad`\Phoenix just got a lottery pick from Washington for Markieff Morris a month ago. Rudy could absolutely get that much or more.`\Favors is just too strong.`\Kings are about to enter the dark ages.`\No one touches Jeffrey Loria, though.`\How excited are you for the arena downtown? What helped you become a top shooter in the NBA?`\West with that vision pass to Boris, good!`\I would hate him too complains on every single no-call seriously just get back on D please`\Love Love`\hah, stihl is a thing in the states? `\This guy asking the real questions.`\Vintage Marco`\And there's the Splashpi`\Peja can I please have that signed emoji you are holding in your proof pic?`\making fun of casspi for consecutive goofs (missed dunk, slipping on floor)`\man if Aminu could make threes, we would be so awesome.`\I wish Lou was still out. The only reason I'm still watching these games is to see what the Young guys can do. `\yep. offense is clicking but we have HUGE Holes on D `\:(`\Hayward is so bad at drawing the foul on shots`\reminds me of when the snyders gave the lions their first win after the 0-16 season`\it was clearly a moving screen tho`\You act as if the 8th seed is some sort of accomplishment. From 2010-11 to 2014-15 (discounting 12-13 season), the Suns primary objective was to get the 8th seed. I don't want the Suns to pick 13th or 14th every year, I'm glad they're finally tanking like they need to.

You think a new arena and new coach will change anything? You've had a new coach year after year after year and still haven't won over 30 games since 2008. Vlade will still be your GM, Vivek will still be your owner, and Cousins will still be a head case.

If I was a Kings fan, the first thing I'd want is for the ownership to fire Vlade, hire a competent GM and step tf back and let him do what he needs to do, even if that means dealing Cousins. `\Yeah if there's such a thing as a "good technical", that was it`\too short though :(`\''And 1'' Offensive foul `\WHY DOES RONDO GUARD DIRK`\Can't believe you think that's enough `\yeah. his layups have been rolling out and he missed a lot of open shots which have gone in and out.`\"double team his ass. Come on guys. DAMN"`\Well we won....`\I used to think that but man he makes the game unwatchable. He constantly bitches and walks up the floor. It sucks because we probably can't get a good trade out of it but I'd still be happy if we traded him.`\Yes, firing Malone was fucking stupid, but I doubt that Malone right now gets us to the playoffs. And I'm getting sick of people saying things that should've been done to cater to boogie. He needs to sack the fuck up. `\Who or What will it take for this man-child to mature. Shit, he's supposed to be a "veteran" now..`\>Karl has got to TRY and pretend to care

man, fuck that, I honestly think that's such a lame thing to expect from a coach. What if he just has the totally reasonable mindset of "arguing and yelling at a referee accomplishes nothing"? The whole "coach gets a T on purpose to inspire his bench" is a load of bullshit. It's just all for show and it's always been stupid. Arguing with a ref isn't going to win you the game, and if people are using "how often he argues with refs" as an indication of how much he cares, then the fans in sacramento are as smart as cousins is mature.`\He would make or break us.`\I didn't know /u/GregMonroe worked for the SacBee.`\sell it to Shaq and get drunk`\The answer is not really in the hands of the GM. Ownership needs to convince Vivek to relinquish control of the team, then hire a GM to work alongside Vlade but be the final voice (believe it or not, Vlade's presence is a very positive thing for this team and Boogie respects him a lot). Then throw a ton of money and a ton of guaranteed years at a proven coach who isn't senile WHO THE GM SELECTS (fuck that part is important). I would then enable them all to do their jobs, but give DeMarcus full assurance that if he wants to stay in Sacramento, he's untradable, because the truth is he gave this season everything he had, came in with a positive attitude and was willing to make things work, and George Karl betrayed that trust and fucked him in the ass. DeMarcus is a man of loyalty above all else, so if we stay loyal to him in his darkest days when shit hits the fan, he would be well inclined to resign here (especially with his bird rights) if we make some improvements.

With a competent GM, an elite coach, and DeMarcus Cousins, this team will succeed. But Vivek needs to get the fuck out of the way, and needs to bring in two proven trustworthy long term solutions to fix our GM/Coach disaster.`\He's the PF Evan Turner.

I don't even know what this means yet, but I know it's right.`\I will never forget that one time the Kings had the 8th seed for like 5 seconds`\Why have I seen Wiz fans in our threads the last week or so pulling for the opposing team? `\Acey just fucked up one of the craftiest passes I've seen.`\broke his fuckin band`\Ughhh it kills me when I see him get a triple double or a highlight on SC, good for him, but I wish he was in a mavs jersey`\Ron Artest?`\#Utah Starting Lineup:

#--------------------------------------------------------------------

I HATE WHEN MACK STARTS!`\Who was your favorite player to play against? `\Curry is gonna go off. WCS going off. I win DraftKings.

Don't care if we actually lose the game. I have Dame and CJ on my team too xD`\I trade both gay and cousins for as many prospects/high draft picks as I can get.  I also go after a young, promising coach, someone like luke walton or someone older but solid like thibs.  I build around WCS and other roleplayer types.  With the cap space from moving gay and cous I take a swing at a free agent in each of the next couple years.  It's hard to get guys to come to sac but it's been done, looking at you cwebb.

Behind the scenes I look at shoring up the organization, doing things like poaching the suns' medical staff or other good guys to have in the front office.  `\He was garbage that game.`\Good for D Lee playing well in a system that he fits in. `\Uh oh watch out b`\This was an atrocious game by us and it's a miracle this was even remotely competitive coming down the stretch.


Our starters had no energy tonight while our bench carried us until near the end when the starters decided to suddenly play with energy.

When Huertas and Sacre are the only dudes who showed up to ball then you're in trouble.


* MWP should never play, play Swaggy instead

* R. Kelly gives /r/nba hope that we can become basketball players ourselves considering he went 0/4 and had 2 TO


And I don't know what to think of Randle anymore. Yeah I'm being reactionary but even though he put up 14 pts and 11 rebounds the amount of tunnel visioning and iso-ball he does is astounding. I mean we had no chance of winning but when we were down 6 he misses a gimme for him and then fouls DMC down the stretch to throw the nail in the coffin for us.


Yeah he's a "rookie" pretty much but that doesn't excuse the stupidity of using a fastbreak to take a contested shot against 3 King players instead of passing it to the 3 open dudes behind you.


It's one thing to tank and lose, it's another to play without smart effort and lose without learning anything from it.`\They're 3 wins away from it with 11 games to go, how bad have they been lately?`\I have heard that Philly has picks and needs some players to round out their frontcourt`\Knight + Len + Suns 2016 1st round draft pick + Washington's 2016  1st round draft pick + Miami's 2018 1st round Draft Pick for Cousins`\He said best player AND top leader.  IF we somehow get Boogie (really big if) then he might be our best player, but there's no way we trust him to come in as a leader to the Celtics.  If he ends up developing into a leader, awesome, but right now he simply does not have the maturity level to be one when there's so much leadership on the Celtics.`\Peja "Swaggy P" Stojakovic`\lol, anybody catch that one-handed rebound by Kawhi? Not quite in the same league as MJ though: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_8oZDiFM5Q`\The Magician is back`\MVP chants for Cuz`\Bledsoe, Booker, Tucker, Cousins, Chandler

Is that what you have in mind?`\What leverage would the team have if they wait until near ASB on the last year of his contract to try and trade him? Teams will just wait until he hits free agency by that point. It's the same thing with us when people were talking about trading Whiteside since he could leave this summer.

If you guys are gonna trade Boogie you gotta do it sooner than later`\:(`\How can the Kings be so bad with so much talent. I feel like if AD played on a team with Rondo/Belli/Rudy/AD/WCS he would win 50 games.`\He looked at you, gave you a once over and thought to himself "yeah, this fella looks like he's a big Dandy Warhols fan. Ima hook him up tonight."`\Hey Peja, over the course of your career you have played for a variety of teams. Was there a team that was harder to adjust to than others?`\Seth with the lockdown D`\I dont disagree that hes been good for us but if we had a chance at getting one of the best big men in the game than I dont see why we should pass that up. Bring in someone in the Rubio skill level guard wise and keep Afflalo and Grant (as long as he continues to develop) i think we would be set. `\DeMarcus looking like a point forward out here`\First of all its "by whom" and secondly it's that same ownership group that refused to trade him and made the coach reconcile the differences. `\Gone: Gay, Bellinelli, Rondo, Butler, Anderson, Collison, McLemore

These guys are all terrible defenders whether by genetics or by choice(Gay and Rondo). Rondo stat pads to a detriment, his lack of shooting touch and holding the ball kills even the best offensive systems(see 2014-2015 Mavs). Gay is a blackhole chucker that only seemed to get it under Malone. He cant be trusted as a stretch 4 and does not have range to be a true wing player. Collison's size kills his versatility, especially on defense and he is very mistake-prone. McLemore is a bust.

The key is to either find a bunch of defenders, like Kent Bazemore and Taj Gibson, to piece into Karl's "all-o, no-d" mindset, or go all out and get more offensive firepower that can create a 5-out system. Since the Kings dont have picks, they should focus on signing talent, and talent that fits the roster around Cousins and WCS and hope to at least reach .500 which would be a massive upgrade over the last ten years they have had`\George Karl is frozen in time and won't change his coaching style to adapt to today's game / what his players are good at doing. Example: the first half of the season he had Boogie taking all these jump shots instead of sending him down low in the post...`\Our mascot's birthday`\THE kings never guard Anderson`\MWP may not be R. Kelly bad...but he's absolutely atrocious.

Why can't we just fucking play Swaggy? At least this guy can play both ends of the floor.`\Doesn't fit into Karl's schemes at all. He signed here to play under Malone, which he did very well.`\I gave up after the Minnesota loss`\We would forego any chance at Simmons/Ingram but still have Bledsoe, Booker, Warren and Cousins to build around. PF would still be a mess but that's a good core. `\That only happens in every Celtic fans' wet dreams...`\Yeah...I thought it was a reason Karl cited for WCS's low minutes in general, prompting WCS to assert his defensive matchup flexibility being second to no one. `\pedo jokes are so funny`\the dude is so fucking disrespectful to his own coach.`\This is some garbage basketball`\That was an extremely uneventful game. The result seemed clear from a few minutes in and everyone seemed okay with it. I don't really remember anything meaningful happening or any standout plays. Just a very generic basketball game. `\you can't play the Spurs 82 times a season though.`\Just know that boogie is a baby and let's his emotions get the best of him. A large market would eat him up. I wish he could play with a guy like Kevin Garnett that could help him become a man.`\is Kevin love a basketball player or an actor? Damn dude just play, and get back on D`\Why does everyone have to think how you think? Why do I have to have a guy with a horrible, negative attitude on my squad?  Why is that so hard to absorb? See you're playing the fucking teenage game, "oh you must not watch ball", sounds like you need to grow the fuck up as well. I've seen players come and go, I've seen people handle bad situations with grace and I've seen toxic situations, and DMC is as toxic as they come. Oh but you're the b-ball expert over here who's been watching ball for decades, the fuck outta here with that. Stop crying

`\If you're on Alien Blue and you go to settings->comments you can turn flairs on!`\Actually to be 100% honest, I don't have a normal account.  I've never signed up for a reddit account before and hardly ever spend time here.  Just a Kings and Peja fan.  `\Sac has some nice big men, which is where we're weakest. Hopefully we can manage that either by containing them, or by having our guards go bananas. Also, can we put a hand in Casspi's face this game. Feels like he's made a million 3s against us this season.`\What do blazer fans think of Crabbe? `\Are these refs fucking SERIOUS???

That was a god damn pussy ass flop

Damn right its no foul`\Got pissed at Karl and had a few words I think.`\go ahead and take him.. give us gasol and rose.`\This is a "garbage time in the 4th quarter of an early October exhibition game vs. Maccabi Tel Aviv" crowd tonight`\TURRIBLE`\Darren Collison...`\yes`\Allen Crabbe y'all. That guy can score`\Lebron James=Low IQ on that last play. `\Yes. except for the ref who wrote a book about it. And common sense.`\I commented in the salah thread in /r/fantasybball saying he's fools gold for fantasy these last 2 games. No one upvoted me though :(`\I actually really liked Koufos off the bench. He never got volume minutes, but was surprisingly good for us down the stretch while the starters got rest.`\damn jr went cold again ):`\Have the wolves blown out anybody this year?..it would be nice to have one game where we have a 20-30 point lead going into the 4th sheesh..

Peja will do an AMA probably only once... And you're asking him about food?`\Give it up dude. /r/NBA has it's narrative and nothing is gonna force them away from it. Nobody wants to read that maybe the Kings choked the series away and the Lakers took advantage because they were more experienced. `\Who is she? http://i.imgur.com/ATqX2B7.png`\Haha nice`\One down...`\I love our team so fucking much.`\They were 9-6 with Boogie but dropped half a dozen games or so when boogie went down and Malone got fired. `\Since we had a .1% chance of making the playoffs`\Wouldn't you say that they're terrible now? Trading Cousins is essentially another reset for them and hopefully they don't mess it up this time and put proper time in developing the players and the culture. `\As a longtime kings fan: PLEASE TRADE COUSINS!!!! #TRADEBOOGIE`\the Kings are just losing this game all on their own

Manu going balls deep and Red Rocket returing to orbit doesn't help either`\Jay Triano is our shooting wizard`\How gone is George Karl after this season, honestly?`\He has already proven to me he's a better passer than Cole.`\Another poor soul has the unfortunate luck of being drafted by the Sacramento Kings.`\Galaxy are great but the always play pretty mediocre for the first half of the season. `\> Things are extremely bad currently, but next year we will have a brand new arena, a new coach, hopefully another decent rookie, and still have Cousins under contract.

I feel like this has been Kings fans way of thinking for the past 10 years. `\Take JJ out of the game jesus christ he doesn't matchup well against the Kings`\pretty sure it wasn't drawn up as an oop.. just dc trying to do too much`\I really hope he never gets traded to Boston. So many people here want him to play for the Celtics, but I am so against that. `\nah it would mess the game up too much, like how introducing the european rim-tipping. both seem like feasible ideas but too drastic of changes to me.`\"You can't rein in Manu. It's like dropping a hot dog on the ground, and asking your dog not to eat it."

*edti: -Sean Elliot`\>he's a shitty human being

Ffs, over-react much?

`\Shame Bayless decided to let Detroit win but its alright. We're not missing these playoffs`\HA! Thanks`\Nice to hear Frazier was signed through the end of the season`\Rockets by far. Wizards, at least they had to deal with a massive amount of injuries at all times and Beal was out for most of the season. Meanwhile, the Rockets have become a really weird gongshowy disappointment with the locker room falling apart at the seams.`\...and the bedshitting has begun`\Regardless of the system though, the Knicks don't have enough shooters. I feel like Rondo would only exacerbate that problem.`\I don't want to keep everyone. That uses too much cap space and this team does have a ceiling defensively because of the bigs. We need to let one of the 3 go unless they all sign for under 10 a year`\Give the players of this game 5 minutes alone with the refs, no cameras.`\Holy shit, the flops are being rewarded tonight`\No they said in the televised broadcast yesterday. As of last night he was literally averaging the exact same points under both coaches. His rebounds are down.

I think he scored 2 points in GS but he had a stomach virus and hardly played at all. `\SPurs DJ GOAT`\yeah

\- george karl, 2016`\Wow didn't even know Butler was still in the league`\There was absolutely no foul there`\Worst loss of the season `\That's fair. I'm withholding judgement until his contract runs out and he plays on a different team.`\Get rid of Boogie. `\Lmao Cuz be like "there a fly on me?"`\Anyone know of a place that would post a stream of the mcgregor fight tonight?`\He doesn't help himself but he's not gonna win anything in Sacramento unless they get a new FO and a new coach.`\I don't remember seeing many people actually say that would be a good deal for the Lakers. I thought that was your point.

Most people on that thread (at a glance) said Kings should do that trade. All I saw on r/lakers was reaction against giving up all those pieces. No one, including Mitch Kupchak, thought the Lakers should do it for randle and the pick. that was the sticking point.`\hes the omri reason its even close`\Because a swap would suck? Kings never won a lottery iirc`\if no one wanted him then thats not a good sign...`\There is something poetic about the Kings being eliminated on a Dallas win.`\How did Tarik Black get 3 fouls already `\Fuck man we have to be able to defend without fouling, I know Caron hasn't played a lot but that was just a bad foul.`\Just to chime in here, I think a lot of us are in the same boat.  A few defend Boogie to the death, a few can't wait to get rid of him, but I think most of us are leaning slightly one way or another.  I love watching him play, (most of the time) he does a lot for the community, seems to actually want to play here, (which is big for Sacramento) etc. but I think if we can get something good, we should move on.

Hire a new GM, let him pick the coach and do what he wants with the roster.  If he can put some good pieces around DMC that actually complement his playstyle and get a good coach that's willing to work with him, I'd be down to give it another shot.  But I think any GM that comes in will want to try to move DMC, and I'm not opposed to it.  `\Wow, three tries at 3 and no go. Bam, 3 at the other end.`\Yeah chief!`\I mean you can make conference finals now`\I'm not even sure you'd get a first for Gay to be honest `\#BELIEVE`\Out with food poisoning`\That was rough.`\Why you wastin all this off season material bro. It's interesting though, the kings will NEVER be successful while that idiot owner treats it like a hobby/toy. Kings are a mess. `\Hahaha the close up of Rudy's serious ass face with the surf music playing in the background.`\Larry why?`\Demarcus with that resting bitch face. `\Is D lee cool tho?`\watch Kings win a championship while Knicks finish last and don't get the 1st overall pick then using that pick they draft a 5 feet tall C that never plays a single minute `\OH BOY!`\How again is lebron my idol?`\I kind of want to see Jimmy Butler go to the Kings, just to see what he, Rondo, and Boogie could accomplish. They have a lot of talent but no real go-to playmaker (Boogie is more of a scorer) down the stretch or any wing defense.`\It's like they found a couple Cavs fans before the game haha`\Fuckin awesome book and even better series.`\This is just boring now, grow up.`\But I'm not even talking about the games, from the very beginning of team USA practices his attitude was different because he knew it had to be in order to be apart of that team`\sup`\Your point? If he didn't "quit on your team" do you guys really think you would have went far in the playoffs anyways? If we somehow get the 8th seed this year, and then Rondo decides to sign with another team next year, will we Kings fans hate Rondo? No`\WOW`\defense is overrated

effort is overrated`\Is Cousins really worth the #1 overall? He's talented but flawed. He would also cost more money than a rooke. If I'm a rebuilding team, I roll the dice on a guy like Simmons rather than gamble that I can make a team around Boogie for him to sign his next contract. `\Empty stats on a bad team`\is a pretty good player to bring off your bench.`\True. Didn't think about other third options on championship winning teams.`\He said joke not an abortion`\Sure, they were old the last couple of years also.

Which is admittedly only a few games. `\Yeah, they had to forfeit a win because they used a player under contract (Duje Dukan) during the all-star break. But in the collective bargaining agreement, it says that you must give rostered players the all-star break off. He scored 22 points in the win but the other team appealed and won. Peja is the GM of the Bighorns and director of player personnel and development for the Kings, but didn't know that specific rule.

Obviously you and Vlade work together quite a bit, and there's plenty of speculation around what DMC is going to do in the offseason. What's your take on rebuilding the team?`\We'd rather stick around.`\I would trade Cousins and Darren Collison to the Knicks for Jose Calderon and Robin Lopez.

Then I'd quit my job, and watch as the Knicks fuck that up anyway.`\I think that package is too big for LA to give up. If the Lakers get Ingram then they've got a 1, a 3, a 4, and a really good 6th man to build around. They'd just have to add a good defending wing and a rim protector and they're on track to compete again.

The part that got to me was her remembering the first home game after it was clear the Kings were staying in Sacramento, and how she also was recovering from cancer at that time.

I've gotta hope she'll be gifted lifetime tickets at Golden One`\Would love to see the Knicks move Ro-Lo, Jose, and another piece needed to make the money work for Boogie. I'm aware its a pipe dream folks but as a knicks fan id say im allowed to dream. `\I thought this aswell, feels bad man. Hope you guys get back to relevance soon, too much talent to be a sub .400 team.

and no draft picks?`\I love your game, Peja. Thanks for doing this!

What's the best and the worst part of your director job?`\The Clippers. Standings in the sidebar to the right. `\Collison was like a damn puppy dog lol`\....Wait a second.`\lol`\Disrespect. That's passion cuz. Look at how angry he gets and how often he gives up in games. Only a passionate player will do that. That's the ideal player right there`\Cousins choked away at the end of it...wtf? `\fuck you`\My God, how is Butler still around?  He's old as a bag of dirt. `\The more I read about this guy the less I think I want him on our team.

I'm seriously worried he would mess up the entire locker room, and I almost never get too concerned about that stuff.

Ainge has dealt with a ton of reclamation projects before and guys that have attitude issues in some form or another (I mean, shit, Smart just got suspended for telling a ref to such on his balls), but I think Cousins is just too much. It's a bridge too far`\Damn :(  But seasons over already. Give Willy and Seth more min.`\Oh my gosh, I totally missed the sarcasm. 100% my fault and obvious in hindsight. Sad thing is that this might be sometime one of the Boogie defenders might actually say...`\I forgot the name of the ref, but he wrote a book claiming that the series against the lakers was rigged. Sacramento should have won. Love you Peja, ur my favorite player of all time. Keep keeping it real!`\Love Aminu, but he really needs to never do that shit.`\Yeah I somewhat agree I guess after thinking about it. I think some players like Frye looked confused running plays after coming in off the bench. And Love is being awkward down low and throwing some sloppy passes out.`\Ayy`\Get up, Gordon!`\Syracuse upset Virginia...  Crazy.  Poor Justin.  Wishin' he'd stayed another year about now...`\Any team would give you a first round pick for him today, no question.

Possibly not the #1 overall, but probably #2 or later.

I'm one of the few Lakers/Kings fans in the world, and I could see mutual benefit in a Boogie for Randle and Clarkson as the main pieces. Lakers probably have to either take back some salary in Marco. I don't see them giving up Russell or trading their pick if it's Simmons, maybe not Ingram either.

But I think Kings might want a star caliber guy to open the new arena. Straight swap with Cle for kLove might be decent.

Denver is probably the right team if you could get Jokic and maybe one other thing.`\I'm 24. I'll give whatever you don't`\He's hardly the one to blame for the tire fire of a situation he's been placed into, with that amount of coaching changes. Put Boogie on a team with a better organization and he might well have made the playoffs by now.

Their options right now:

1. Keep a top tier player on their team and work from there

2. Dump a top player, and go back to complete hopelessness yet again

I never ever ever see the point in a team dumping their (by far) best player without an actual plan in place. They're not "stuck" with him, they're blessed to have him
`\Koufos' dribbling there was the funniest thing I've seen in a long time`\Biggie reppin' Brooklyn in San Antonio`\my new favorite insult`\Dam3!!!`\wow McLemore got bodied up BAD by Carter.`\Two NBA power houses go at it and only 6 comments in an hour? /r/NBA must be dying.`\Please just trade Boogie to the Celtics. He deserves so much better than this mess`\I think 'Sheed is a bit of an angel compared to JR Rider?`\They all became nervous nellies at the end of the game sans Bibby. `\Cousins has had these problems his entire career.`\Broken finger`\That in itself is just fucking embarrassing`\Hey Peja, do you remember your times when you were stationed in Požega,Croatia?Lot of local people I talk to mention that you lived there for a quite nice time before war started.`\The Kings FO is really confusing. They must know that they can't win with him, but they have blown every opportunity to trade him. If they traded him when he was killing it, they could of robbed the Celtics of a lot of assets.
`\Saving this.`\He's had some good games. Definitely a player that will prosper under the Spurs' system.`\Hahahhaha rondo and boogie. I love em.

Edit* Oh fuck suspension goddamn`\Manu has gotta be top 5 fiercest competitor of all time. `\I've said this before and I'll say it agian.  He might put a good team over the top, but any rebuilding team would be dumb to make a move to trade for Cousins.  He's a known team cancer and has never won more than 30 games.  I'd rather the Lakers suck next year than trade for Cousins and watch his whining ass lead us to a 32-50 record.`\According the evidence I provided, the referees gave them bullshit calls. Where's your evidence of bullshit calls on the lakers or are you just gonna point to the amount of free throws again?`\Few weeks ago at most http://espn.go.com/nba/boxscore?id=400828503`\Being a King's fan is like being a punching bag.  It's getting really old.`\#FuckKyle`\So with Kobe and Tim retiring this year, how much longer does Dirk have?`\Its all making sense now. Its the 3rd quarter.`\this is absurd`\Casspi* and he's playing right now.`\Rasheed was good crazy. Cousins is a whiny loser`\I wouldn't have thought so`\Lmao [Kings fans like...](https://cdn.streamable.com/video/mp4-mobile/ac21.mp4)`\You can't just brush off those dudes. They'd all bring back serious return, even Collison (how many borderline starting guards can be had for pennies?). `\https://vine.co/v/iXBBvlnDzUq`\Yeah doesn't mesh well with the Kings at all, Mike Malone where you at?`\Lmao why is DeMarcus shooting the 3 especially when it's a quick shot like that???`\"Hornbro"`\He needs to retire. I like him but enough is enough `\Where'd you hear that? Sounds interesting.

And even if the calls weren't bad, Karl has got to TRY and pretend to care.. he stands up like twice during the duration of a game since the all star break shenanigans. He doesn't seem to care. `\Of course Manu ends up getting a season high as soon as he comes back from an injury. That's soooo Manu.`\Ah yes even bigger retards are the ones that singled out game 6, what about game 3?`\I still can't believe they let Philly fuck them that hard. Vlade is such an idiot.`\Would love to see him with the Pacers or the Wizards.

Would also like to see a dominant front court of Cousins Drummond.`\Hopefully this isn't a trap game :-/`\wtf, they're giving Kings players their due, plus if you don't know Sean Elliott dude has veins of ice, likely [not flaccid](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9FDboZTyeuA)`\"Rusty's a team player" LOL`\Slim chance.

I thought he might be a reasonable stretch 4 off the bench. He has all the tools but he never hits his shots and misses catches and plays too slow on defense and just can't make it work on the court consistently at all. He torches the d-league though. He should go to Europe and see if he can't stretch his career out.`\Damn mobile =(`\Ah.  So, really, nothing from Montero on that series.  Alrighty then. `\Draymond was a second round pick. Noone expected him to be this good. He has got to where he is through relentless effort. Instead of his anger and passion distracting him, he uses it as fuel on the court. Maybe the Kings arent winning because Cousins spends the whole game whinging.`\i would read the collective bargaining agreement and ask questions about the parts i don't understand until i really knew all the rules that determine what NBA teams can and cannot do backwards and forwards.`\Lol`\Holy fuck that's depressing. He plays good as of and had to carry the team most of the year. What a shame`\WTF CSN`\30 for 30 name confirmed`\Dloo`\He needs to be in an organization like San Antonio or Miami. He genuinely isn't a bad teammate I think, over emotional and probably immature sure when it comes to other things. But often times we forget how nice of a trait it is to care so much. The Kings FO also deserves blame for straining their relationship just as much as his character does.

After so many up and downs, it just isn't a good fit anymore. Karl will get fired eventually, bring in another coach, get new players in FA and still same thing. This year with Boogie, Rondo, and Gay along with a better supporting cast and a coach like Karl had so many positives initially and look where they are now.`\It's more like nonfunctional when we're talking about the Browns`\Man do I love seeing the whole team's reaction to that Love three`\Probably the Kings :(`\Ha!

If they can convince the Kings and Clarkson to commit to a sign and trade, and ship him with Randle and a top 3 pick for Cousins it would be a steal for them!

Russell will be a laker for 4 more years. Cousins will have 2 years left in his contract. They go after DeRozan. They go after Harrison Barnes. Sign a couple of vets that want to play in LA. Fire their coach.

It would energize the organization. They'd be a very young, talented team with players that have proven they can do well in the league.

This franchise needs to be completely rebooted from the ground up, and unlike the Nets they have DPs.

That trade would in hindsight be second only to the Harden trade, you'll see. That was an AMAZING trade for MIN, a truly legendary trade for you guys.`\Idk, I don't think any contender should want him, especially if you think about what they'd lose just because of the salary cap if they got him as an FA, let alone what they'd need to give up in a trade.

Not sure a rebuilding team wants him either, he's shown he isn't the guy to carry them to the playoffs, just good enough to give you a late lottery pick instead of an early one.

So you're left with the teams in the middle, some of which already have centers that, while they might not be as talented, aren't fucking basket cases either.

There's probably only like 8 teams out there that should be interested in boogie, probably a few more that are because of bad front offices.

Most importantly tell Vivek to let the basketball minds do the thinking stay out of the way.`\Should I use Aminu or Harkness for the calendar this month?`\GINOS CUP IS DA REAL MVP`\you gotta move baby.`\I hope this is an ironic answer.`\Kings get Burke, Wizards get Boogie and we get Wall, who says no?`\Lol this game tho`\He is a black hole on offense `\He's just trying too hard honestly, trying to force it.`\"season" or "career" high is something you hear a lot as a kings fan`\I think you are over analyzing it. Half of the "trade cousins" posts are followed by "yeah I'd love to see him play in 'insert my city here.'"`\Not really. There's plenty of games he's had that he's fucked up but he's hardly alone. Tonight was definitely his worst game though `\All these fucking cheating ass baby races. BITCH GET YO BANANAS OFF THE FLOOR `\Lebron is awesome sorry.`\Great game from KAT, if he keeps this up we can only hope that one day he can be as good as Nikola Jokic!`\Harkless with the spin cycle! That's was fuckin SICK!`\If we sign and stash a bunch of players and don't pick up some of the team option contracts after this year we could use all the picks. Also, the trade value is only low when we are trying to pry a player that a team doesn't really want to give up because they can try and get an overpay based on us not being able to use them all anyway. When they are actively trying to shop Cousins then all that matters is providing a better package than the rest of the league.`\There isn't 100% consensus among the basketball writers, but most of the Sixers fans feel confident that we're understanding it correctly.

From Larry Coon's CBA, he writes: "When dealing with protected picks, the Stepien rule is interpreted to mean that teams can't trade a pick if there is any chance it will leave the team without a first round pick in consecutive future drafts. Suppose a team makes a trade in 2011-12 that conveys a first round pick sometime from 2012 to 2017. The pick is protected only if it is the first overall pick from 2012 to 2017, and if it is not conveyed by 2017, the other team gets cash instead. In other words, in order to avoid sending a pick from 2012 to 2016, the team would have to win the first overall pick in the draft lottery five seasons in a row. Even though the likelihood of this happening is essentially nil, the team is not allowed to trade its 2018 pick."

So if the Kings keep their pick in '16 and now owe Chicago a 2017 1st, "teams can't trade a pick if there is any chance it will leave the team without a first round pick in consecutive future drafts". The 2018 top-10 protected 1st cannot be traded in any capacity because there is a chance that the Kings convey their pick to Chicago in '17 and then lose to Philly in '18. So Philly automatically gets the '19 unprotected. That's how Sixers fans are understanding it anyway.

There's a huge discussion about this very issue on the comments within this mailbag if you're interested in reading.

FUCKIN KAWHI`\Just to be clear, the other poster suggested the nets pick PLUS crowder or smart AND IT.

I think Boogie is the best center in the game. I would not make that trade of I'm the celts if the nets pick is #1. You'd be giving up two of your 3 best players and Ben Simmons for a guy the Kings may have to trade.`\show me another center in the league that can do that`\If the arm sleeve bothers Russell so much, he should just remove it`\Where's the duck?

I miss the 'Primo' commercials he used to mix in.`\WHAT TIME IS THE FIGHT?`\Peja, having you on the Mavs was amazing. Congrats on the title. My question is who was your favourite team mate over the years and who are you in most frequent contact with now you are off the court?`\David Lee is productive as fuck`\True professionals`\Wittman is not that bad they said. At least he brought great defense and defensive intensitiy they said..............`\Give me a fucking break man.

They tried so hard with their cute "JOHN WALL MAKING REGGIE JACKSON MONEY LOL" comment that was in every thread at the beginning of the season. They came into the thread tonight talking shit. And they even made a thread in their own sub for this game.

They're great, they deserve to be in the playoffs and have success. We didn't. But their fans are so embarrassing on here.`\https://twitter.com/sacramentokings/status/713591760631402496`\Tonight we're gonna party like it's 2003`\YO. PM Your email so I can add you to these google sheets. `\Beal, Gortat, 2 future firsts for Boogie. Who says no?`\psn?`\touche`\The doucher crowd that sits closer to the court is pretty hard to stomach in Dallas.  `\Lol, at least Boogie can stroke it from deep.`\They suck at the end of quarters fr. There's always some kind of 5-10 point run to end quarters against us`\he can be an excellent secret agent for the lakers and ruin the celtics rebuild from the inside`\They can still rob a team of a ton of assets. Despite his attitude issues there are many that consider him the best c in the nba. Combine that with the fact that hes young and on a good contract and they will get a heck of a lot`\Barrea and Dirk would make a cute couple.`\What do you think is the biggest strength of the current Kings squad? How do you take advantage of this? `\Woohoo`\Human being first sure, but also a fucking celebrity athlete who played on one of the most exciting teams we've seen in the last twenty years..

Even in the scope of him being a human first, you could ask something philosophical or advice in one's pursuit of their passion...but you ask him about food. Good call man

`\Yo can I get a gif of that Pop "Bullshit!" please? `\We think he's fabulous. `\I don't get it?`\And bails us out on the other end with a nice floater`\Boogie is no shaq. His attitude on the floor every night is a disgrace to the game. Maybe you are right but the kings are not the ones to give him his "Kobe" and lead his way to success. `\Wtf is your username. How is somebody with that racist garbage an nba fan. And one of our ours too smh

Edit [this guy](http://www.reddit.com/r/whiterights/comments/4a6oy4/the_carjacking_dindu/d0xtel2). Can we please confine his posting to /r/whiterights and keep it away from this sub? `\He probably will unless Stotts thinks the matchup favors, say Vonleh.  `\Rudy is simply outplaying him on the King's defensive end. He missed some shots that he was forcing, and missed a few easy shots that he should have made. `\I look back at the Aldridge situation, and I wish I (and the org) would have seen the writing on the wall sooner. Did he blow up at the GM, coach, or players? No. He said and did the right things.  If I had taken a step back and taken off my scarlet and black tinted glasses, though, it would have been pretty clear he was done playing here. Maybe I'm bitter or cynical or whatever, but I see the same thing happening with Cousins.`\David Lee was a complete steal for the Mavs`\Every game Dirk has played against the Kings this year, he's done horribly in. Has his shooting just declined this year in general or is it just lucky on our part?`\Rasheed Wallace was a very valuable player despite being a bigger headcase than Boogie. `\Where's Kaspi? I only ask cus I'm a Jew and I like that he's Israeli.`\I'd be surprised to see if they even get good offers for him at this point. Yes, he's a great player and can put up huge numbers. But that's never translated to wins for his team and is quickly approaching GOAT territory in the terrible attitude category. Not many teams having coaching and culture strong enough to affect him, methinks. `\wizards pls`\I literally explained that right in my post. If that 27-11 isn't good enough to put him among the very best players in the league he's not a superstar. I shouldn't have to explain why he isn't as good as Curry, Durant, or LeBron. `\As always, every top comment is a joke instead of actual discussion`\After all that has happened, I see them doing this when free agency starts. The C's will probably trade the BKN pick because they were gonna go Bender, who won't even be in the league right away. I'd go for Sullinger/Zeller, and Smart maybe if they were willing. I really do see this happening, and it would be for the better. The Kings would get more picks obviously. `\They're going to keep him until his contract ends, foolishly trying to make win now moves that don't work until he leaves for nothing.  At least, that seems like a likely scenario.`\Cavs are starting to roll. Sacramento needs to get a hold of themselves or this will get ugly quickly.`\Walls practically a Canadian compared to boogie, it'd never mesh`\I'm shocked that anyone did-- Lee looks just as capable as he did 2 seasons ago. Great high-energy, hustle guy that's incredibly valuable as a rebounder and an efficient finisher.`\In college Towns was a back to the basket shot blocking big. Nothing about his game besides his defense stood out at Kentucky. During workouts he showed a completely different game that they never used at Kentucky for some reason `\He had red flags coming out of school too which is why he slid. `\What is your favorite part of your job?`\i want you to meet my friend Danny`\What a god damn shame man. I'm sorry.`\Our subreddit tends to disagree, CJ and Dame are very close friends and this team chemistry is too much to screw with. I'd rather keep CJ than take a locker room cancer.`\Is it weird that i call Ginobili as " The Nose' or that is too insulting ?`\It's not like we are a playoff team right now. It's easy for people to argue there is no scenario where he is traded. He's got great numbers but these people don't watch him night after night. When Karl was hired he wanted to trade boogie right away...why trade your best player? There is a reason.`\They still have assets, though. If they trade Cousins, Gay, and Collison they could end up with a nice collection of young talent to build around. Plus, they already have McLemore (I know, I'm not sold on him either) and Cauley-Stein.`\You realize he was running some weird semi-zone defense where opposing offenses were just running players through the middle of it for layups? You realize he had the players push the ball handler into the middle of the lane? That Thibs had to be advised on simple stuff like rotations and where to funnel drives?

That he has a low post talent that his staff think is better on the perimeter? That this has lead to Cousins efficiency dropping? That DMC could bruise most teams in the league but spends 75% of the offense at the 3 pt line? That you're making him drive through an entire defense?

That you're having the team switching everything so that Darren Collison is guarding Dirk on end game possessions?

That Karl talks about needing defensive minded players, about how Curry is his best defensive guard and yet never plays those players? `\AC!`\piss off pisssston`\nothing gets me hyped quite like lebron draining threes`\Suspending Boogie for a game is going to be pretty detrimental to the Kings chances of winning that game.`\#2002neverforget`\Missed foul, and the make-up call. `\We are so fucking hot`\Why hasn't Carlilse played McGee at all? He killed us last time`\Hey Peja! Thank you so much for taking time out of your busy schedule to do this, we really appreciate it!

I'm just curious what kind of day-to-day duties are done while running the role of Director of Player Development and Personnel? I've been very much interested in working a front office as my career move, and also wondered what kind of skill sets are very important to have other than basketball knowledge?

Note: Data from basketball-reference, March 25th. Guide from /r/ConciseGameGuides
&gt;&gt; `\Guard the fucking three! How do we still leave shooters open this late into the season?!`\George Karl flat out doesn't give a fuck. Hasn't called a time out all quarter or even moved on the bench as his team gets their ass kicked in this quarter.`\Hobe showing the moves. `\Man I love reddit, very riveting discussions.`\holy shit, where has Acy been all this time??`\I understand the sentiment behind trading Boogie and acquiring assets.. but this team hasn't been especially great when having assets at their disposal already.

Their last 4 first round picks:
2015: WCS (6th Pick)
2014: Stauskas (8th Pick)
2013: McLemore (7th Pick)
2012: Thomas Robinson (5th Pick)

Realistically, I'm saying I'm glad I don't have to be the one to make the decision, because I'm sure there's no clear cut answer.

If we're going the 'pipe-dream' route though.. they overpay for Mike Conley, keep Boogie, try to dump Rudy Gay's contract, and go after Nic Batum.

That keeps Boogie the center of the offense and puts veteran team-oriented players around him. `\God damn I love this team`\We have more D-leaugers than NBA players at this point`\As a Laker fan I wanted us to sign him... Thank the fucking lord I'm not the GM. `\[Save as .dmx](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YrrAroK6bI)`\Anyone see that chick with a beer who fell down behind Hoiberg?`\Man i just turned on the game like 5 minutes ago and it has been an absoulte cluster fuck...why the hell is Sacre in? Has the whole game been this fucky?`\Dirk was fairly mobile as a young player. He actually played some SG at the start of his career.`\love kcp's clutch shots

and he wants 'em too.

`\You're the reason we have to have /s tags around here, jesus fucking christ.

Let's learn to contextualize shall we?`\GGnoRE`\I feel bad for Boogie. His team lets him down so often.`\WE COOKIN NOW BOYZ

I

WANT

TO

BELIEVE`\kyrie swerving`\This is pretty obvious sarcasm`\Now is about the time where you thank the Kings for taking Ben McLemore`\Yeah, people should only get invested when their team starts winning. Surely no one will ever complain about them being bandwagoners.`\What a joke`\Skin Wade put it well, it was like a movie where two guys are crawling for the gun`\GG`\while we screech in i hope`\I'd say comparable. Simmons also wouldn't be a #1 pick in a draft that had Towns. `\we had one of the best offenses in nba history. needed defense to win a chip`\Well if we won #2, it would be less sucky :)`\He needs to take that shit off`\Okay will plan for him unless I cant find a good pic.`\defense hard`\LET KAWHI COOKKKKKKK`\Had to close my stream. The Cavs commentators are unbelievably painful.`\he's bitching after every play`\I only watched the second half, but he didn't look bad out there.  For a little while, it seemed like he was playing harder than anyone.`\late whistle on an intentional foul, quick whistle on every flop. i literally cannot even`\Your guess is as good as anyone's.`\he's only 26 though`\He's always had technical foul problems, but he has never so blatantly and consistently disrespected a coach that I can remember. Getting techs isn't a legit problem, of the top 10 in the league this season, 8 are former/current all-stars, the other two are DeAndre Jordan and Marcus Morris.

Cousins just wants a coach that he feels like is on his side. Sure, you can call that childish. But his relationship with Karl is unrepairable. And the Kings are going nowhere this season or the forseeable future, so the fact that they force these two to coexist in a terrible losing environment is absolutely laughable in my opinion.`\whew whew!`\Most of us stopped giving a shit about the team at this point.`\If they moved to Seattle, you wouldn't have had to endure this. `\And when you consider what they're doing to their lottery odds by winning right now, it's even worse!`\Cavs announcers...

lol there is no way any of you downvoters think they are good.`\Love would probably play well for the guangdong tigers `\You can have Nick Young.`\At least if the Kings get blown out we might see Moreland get some playing time.`\Mejri playing some very interesting defense early on`\Jerry and Grant > Jerian Grant`\CANT BUY A BUCKET`\Well I think you need to get as much value as you can out of DMC. So maybe you get Brooklyn pick and hell you can throw Rudy Gay in that trade and get a couple 2nd rounders or something from Boston. Maaaaaaaaaybe DMC and Gay for Brooklyn pick and a guy like Avery Bradley/Marcus Smart.

Then you need to pick a God and pray Philadelphia doesn't fuck you up with the pick swaps. Draft a good back court player (Buddy Hield maybe?) and build on a back court of Smart(Bradley)/Hield/McLemore. Also, find a PF either in the draft or on FA that compliments Willie well. He's the type of center you can take forward and find a lot of success with.

Then sign a few veteran FAs (nothing too big, locker room guys and a few rotational players.)

Oh, and get rid of Karl and hope Thibs or some elite coach takes your offer. Give them a lot of control.`\Tim Frazier has made our offense 10 times better already.

This is our second ten day guy who plays great. Let's just sign only 10 ten players. `\Wow we can't catch a fucking break `\Racist?`\Gotta close out quarters. Great half but should be up 20 not 16.`\Have you ever felt bad for not having the opportunity to lace them up for Yugoslavia in your prime?`\he did lose us the game against the hornets. that game still fucking hurts`\Trey burke?  I forgot about that guy`\I <3 Bonner`\BOBAN BACK TO PROTECT THE HOME!`\This has been a really fun game.`\Sorry to say, Kings fans, but Vivek is basically Dolan 2.0.  You’re probably screwed for a while…



No autonomy = GM can't really do their job well`\PATTY THRILLS`\farewell minutes maybe?`\SHH!!! IT'S A STRAT!!!!`\God you're annoying af. Do you search rondo on this sub just to comment shit about him? `\what do you mean its on /quack?`\I cant figure out kevin love at all`\I think Bellinilli is the quintessential "system player"

He was exactly what we needed at the time, and would never be worth the same to anyone else. He's not a bad player, he will knock down those open shots. It's just that the Spurs were capable of getting him those looks that he needed. He was great with the Spurs but he's never going to be that open again. `\lmao dude still hasn't learned a thing `\Bonner is in

Kings fucked`\Boban looks gassed, flailing a bit `\shoot the DANG ball Kyle!`\How are they trying to make it happen? There losing games lol`\Sounds like James Anderson on the Kings, except for the "amazing drive and assist" part`\Oh. Whoosh lol`\no team has won a championship without a top 10 offense and top 10 defense in the last ~15 years. We were 28th in the league in perimeter defense and we pretty much had to use our offense to bail us out every game. We needed a defensive pg.`\Not really. His percentages from the field have been terrible lately.`\Fuck bar rescue and fuck Jon Taffer.  We need franchise rescue with Lebron James and his crew.`\This guy knows what's up. Life is rough for a Kings fan.`\What the fuck??`\Stay away from Jamal Murray. I don't want to see him stuck in that trash can.`\where there is a will, there is a kangz crashing into the darkness`\Gobert is fucking strong amirite? Threw Cousins around like a child without even knowing it.`\It's always been one more season since he's been drafted. The kings FO (as i've heard so far) are really toxic in terms of chemistry. Mike Malone was the right guy that they chose to fire for no good reasons.`\Zero`\I'd rather start Teletovic/Leuer at PF or else a rookie that we draft with the Wizards' pick and just bring Chandler off the bench. Better spacing that way. `\This guy is joke and such a pussy.  He deserves so much of the blame for the Kings being trash.  There's a reason they have never won 30 games with him there until (probably) this season.  He's been on bad teams for sure but he has called himself the best center in the game, "hands down".  Look at the other players who are best at their position.  You could put any of them on the Sixers and they'd almost certainly be a playoff team let alone reach 30 wins.  Curry on the Sixers? Easy.  Harden ? It's close.  LeBron? Definitely. Draymond or Griffin ? Close.  Cousins is more talented but I'd rather have Marc Gasol or even Drummond because those guys don't lose their teams games with dumbass techs and defensive possessions given up to cry about getting fouled   `\I sympathize, watching the Knicks does the same thing to me.`\typical favors, great plays and terrible free throws`\Fuck how many pros come from that school lol`\Dude. They can't do anything right `\That's something for the team to decide. Every situation is different and the only people with enough knowledge to make a decision work for the organization`\Yeah I definitely agree that it needs to be a great offer. There will be a lot of buyers though.`\o shit thats right, not sure why i thought unrestricted `\[My reaction to this game when I have to get up in 5 hours to start pre-rounding in the ICU](http://vignette3.wikia.nocookie.net/uncyclopedia/images/5/54/Abe_Simpson_in_and_out.gif/revision/latest?cb=20120722183322)`\Gotta have something to root for, being 2 games out of the playoffs and the team crumbling. `\First 2 paragraphs the writer suggests even cutting him.`\He had a couple of highlight plays against the dubs, and even ran point a couple of times.  Looks like he just found his confidence...maybe Carlisle's too.`\You serious? That sounds completely retarded for the Lakers.`\Good job Rick. Keep playing your back up 3 point guard lineup with Dirk and David lee guarding the middle. What the fuck man.`\https://youtu.be/32npOZpv-Wc?t=55`\Now that I'm back I do. Some of the guys work for the organization, some live in the area. For some period after I stopped playing I hadn't honestly been in touch with too many of my former teammates. It's great to be around each other and reconnect.`\all according to plan`\I feel ya`\god damn this broadcast got sad`\Hey if we both beat ATL then even they are not out of reach yet, they have a brutal schedule remaining.. `\Yeah, because we have had a new arena incoming for 10 years...

This is the most optimistic we have all been for a long time. It's just slipped away after this last Cousins situation and losing streak. Prior to that, we were in the fight for the 8th seed. Your team hasn't sniffed it.`\can he only guard 2's?`\It's like Manu never even left`\Maybe we should have them start from now on`\>  where is the evidence of questionable calls in the kings favor?

Game 5, when Shaq had 5 fouls going into the 4th quarter on mostly offensive fouls?  Kobe playing through crunch time after Shaq fouled out with 5 fouls, barely misses the final shot with Bobby Jackson tugging his jersey down.

> Free throw disparity could mean the kings were more aggressive throughout the series?

Here's my view on free throws for the series.  If you asked the Kings, all you need to do is shoot a better free percentage than Shaq and you'll win, do you think they could do it? Nope.`\Geez.  Didn't realize it had been that long.

Congrats.  Kings earned that game even if they almost gave it back to the Mavs.  `\Seriously ... my 2 fave teams (bulls) just seeem like they are giving up.

Fuck bball i never liked it anyway. ...`\Don't feel too bad for them, we're 3-7 over our last ten, 5 games out of the playoffs, and haven't been in the playoffs for ~6 years`\probably throw in the NY/DEN 1st rounder, our own late first rounder and maybe even next year's first rounder for him.

Check his stats since February 1st? `\Um Id take him. I don't know what we'd do with JV (and I love him) but Boogie is by far superior and we'd be competing for #1 in the east. However, I have no idea if we even have the assets for that.`\That looks like a good block live.  Would like to see replay.`\dirk back the other way`\I honestly wouldn't be surprised if love wasn't trying to sell that. Dude gets tossed around all the time`\GG. Randle misses an easy layup then makes a stupid foul.

Originality?
`\Come on man Gobert is not that strong`\+1 for the Motherland!`\I'm not even sure what I want anymore. To win? Or lose? Do we even have a draft pick if we keep losing? I don't think we do but I could be wrong. And winning doesn't do much for us except for holding on to what little morale this team has left. Hmmmpfffff. `\Hes such a nice piece on the team.

All he did was yell at a coach, calm yourself.`\Snatched it from space!`\Hi Peja, your Top 5 best shooter of all time?`\This was KAT's 21st 20pts 10rebs game which places him 4th in the whole league, only behind Cousins (1st), Davis (2nd) and Durant (3rd)`\Kawhi is so weird tonight`\This lineup is working beautifully. The effort level is 110% right now.`\ah idk about that guys.`\Read it as "Sacramento Kings release DeMarcus Cousins". He would be a great fit in Houston and we should pick him up if that happened. Harden, Ariza, Josh Smith, Dwight Howard, and DeMarcus Cousins is a terrifying lineup.`\Hi Peja, Was the 2011 series against the Lakers one of your favorite moments in your career? You and Dirk was lit that series.`\Edit what? `\this team is such a fucking dumpster fire `\Look man, I don't see why you need to be  defensive.

Maybe the Basketball Gods wanted to spare me.`\Wide

Fucking

Open`\yes`\It's time for the NBA to force a trade for basketball reasons, just so he's not wasted on a SAC team whose ownership group has routinely stabbed him, pulled the knife out, said "sorry", and then stabbed him again.

EDIT: the first part is clearly /s for the guy beneath me.`\GET SOME!`\4pt play by Love`\Melo's out with a migrain`\Hello Peja. what got you interested in basketball as a youngster?`\>Rondo to Row 2.

haha`\He didn't actually say that right? Source?`\That was a nice midrange J`\Flair up`\and the only thing you'd hear on the phone is the 5 seconds of laughter before the Kings FO hangs up`\You'd be bitter too if you saw Pistons fans coming in for the last like 5 gamethreads shit talking your team while you're fighting for a playoff spot lol`\WOW`\Not a huge deal, but I'm unclear on why Dame played 29 minutes tonight. He very easily could have taken it easy in the second half and save something for the playoffs.`\Well when DMC was having that stretch of putting up huge numbers, I kept saying it's a lot of fluff and his game hasn't improved outside of developing the three point shot. I think kings fans are realizing he's not a star level player in terms of impact`\I feel so good living 3 hours away so by default a spurs fan `\nice b8 /u/b8lord

EDIT: Fuck the Rockets`\Oh he outplayed a 20 year old rookie and a 2nd year guy who came back too early from injury. Wow! Impressive. I would hope a guy who has been in the league for 6 years and is supposed to be the best center in the league would outplay a couple of young bigs who are still developing.

By the way where is his team in the standings? Where have they been every year he has been there? When does he prove he can do more than put up nice stats and fight with his coaches and Front offices?`\He's not top 10 in PER and I'm pretty sure "being an asshole" isn't part of that metric either so I don't see how you figure he's a top 10 player. Yeah, Randle is average, he hasn't even played through a full season. His numbers this year are about on par with Cousins's rookie season.`\LOL nice try`\For booing? lmao`\So what is happening within these types of scenarios?

People expected the Kings to make the playoffs because of Cousins. Same with Love with the Wolves and Davis with the Pelicans

I mean, they're superstar caliber players no doubt but why can't they push their team to playoff contention?`\you a doctor? nurse?
`\Somebody better tell they guys that we need to win this if we want to get swept by the Warriors`\"A Chink in the Armor"`\Embarrassing... `\they're still on lawlor vs anderson. taking forever.`\Initiate tank mode`\I feel bad for myself for putting up with this on a regular basis.

Why do you think so many European bigs (in terms of height and length) such as yourself and Dirk can shoot so well from just about any range? `\I'm not sure if any team with Cousins could win a ring. For him to be effective, you've got to play at his pace, which is relativley slow. The only way I could see him winning a ring is if he shoots over 40% on threes, hits 65% of open jumpers. He'd also need to lose some weight to increase his footspeed on defense and improve his decision making.

I think we can all agree that the first order of business this offseason is hiring a savvy GM and letting him choose our new coach.

After that I think we need to make some big changes. My ideal scenario is to trade Boogie to the Celtics for Jae Crowder and the Net's 2016 & 2018 pics (plus filler to balance salary). Assuming Simmons and Ingram are gone I would take Kris Dunn with the Nets pick and Buddy Hield with ours.

Let Rondo walk. Trade Rudy and Belinelli. I know a lot of you are ready to get rid of Ben but I personally would like to see him play without Boogie (rumors have it that Boogie is very hard on teammates and I think that it may be eroding what little confidence Ben has and limiting his development)

Our roster would be:

Dunn - Collison /// Hield - McLemore /// Crowder - Casspi /// Quincy - ?? /// Willy - Koufos

Maybe include one of Boston's bigs or one of their other 2016 picks to round out our front court.

This would give us the chance to start fresh, establish a positive (healthy) culture, and a solid young core to build around. The additions of Kris Dunn, Buddy Hield, and Jae Crowder would give us playmaking, shooting, and above all perimeter defense!!! And this doesn't even take into account what we could get in return for Rudy and Marco. We get a ton of cap flexibility and even a future pick (Nets 2018) to continue the rebuild.`\> When Cousins trade talks between the Kings and Los Angeles Lakers last June failed, when Cousins’ agent, Dan Fegan, was orchestrating a way out for his client amid frustration over Karl, some rival executives who read about the Kings’ demands and saw them as exorbitant took notice. If the Kings wanted the No. 2 pick, Julius Randle, Jordan Clarkson and draft considerations for Cousins, some of them thought, then why even bother engaging in discussions?

If anything, that's not enough for cousins. `\Yes, man. You are wrong. He is averaging exactly the same amount of points under Rambis as he was with Fisher. Exactly. Look it up. His rebounds are down, his points are the same.`\That was a really strange ending with the techs`\Wow, Mack is tearing it up from 3 these last two games. `\Worth it Lee`\Celtics, Sixers, Magic, Blazers, Nuggets, Suns and the Lakers IMO.`\He has my h3art.`\SERIOUSLY??`\I would. The team atmosphere could help fix his character. But the thing about Pop is he doesn't have the time or patience to baby players and hold their hands so they can  mature. That's why S-Jax got waived for demanding more minutes and saying he was better than Ginobili and it's why they waived Danny 6 days after they signed him. If they saw DMC making a full effort and not constantly returning to old ways, they will do their best to help him. If not, the team would just leave him inactive until they traded him.

But great game from AD nonetheless.

They reportedly decided they are only bringing in guys with good attitudes that want to be here. Say what you will but it is hard to argue that Cousins has ever had a good attitude, and I say that as a fan of Cousins on the court.

The Nuggets are in a great position, people who do not watch the team keep pushing this whole idea that the Nuggets have to go get a big name, and for the last 4 years they have clearly stated that they want a team with top 5-10 players at each position and a top 5 bench, they have a group that can grow into that, no need to make a trade for a headcase.

Here are there last five draft picks, not counting this most recent draft since it's hard to judge it now and not counting Cousins, who was an obvious win. I've included the two players picked after they picked:

* #8 Nik Stauskas... Noah Vonleh, Elfrid Payton
* #7 Ben McLemore... Kentavious Caldwell-Pope, Trey Burke
* #5 Thomas Robinson... Damian Lillard, Harrison Barnes
* #10 Jimmer Fredette... Klay Thompson, Alec Burks
* #4 Tyreke Evans... Ricky Rubio, Johnny Flynn

Obviously, a huge pile of crap. Now note despite all the losing, Sac has no top 3 picks. Part of that is luck. THe Kings had the worst record heading into the 09 lottery but ended up with the #4 pick, missing out on Blake Griffin and James Harden (and Hasheem Thabeet!). In fact, in four of the five drafts above, the Kings picked lower than their record.

So that sucks.

But drafting isn't the only thing that matters. You need to develop your young players by putting them in a stable supportive environment, allowing them to fail as they adjust without fear that the next misplay will lead to a lot of time on the bench or worse, being traded. This requires a coach who's with the program and understands how to mentor young players.

Sac has also mostly hired old school type coaches and has shuffled through them on an almost annual basis. They need a young coach who understands the present and the future of the league and who's willing to be a team player and play young guys. They don't need Tyrone Corbin or Keith Smart or the drama queen George Karl.

Most of all, Sacramento can't lose trust in the process. Each year you suck, you feel more pressure to just say, "Forget the process! It's not working!" and the Kings have done that numerous times, most notably last summer with the disastrous trade with Philly. They're not the only team to do so. The Knicks suck for more or less the same reason and many other teams have gotten caught in the mediocrity trap.

But as a small market team especially, they need to hit in the draft. There's no other way to improve.`\lol the Heat are clearly capable of being a bad team, but 2018 is 2 seasons from now.

do you really think they'll be in the lottery by then?`\should've traded cousins for some kind of package involving jabari parker at the deadline this year

If we could skip the assassination of belli and get him to bounce back to the place he has been his entire career it would help a huge amount.

A lot of Kings fans think they need to give it another shot (for, what, rebuild #5?!?). That's just not going to work. The roster is bad enough that it would need a complete overhaul. They don't have enough non-Boogie pieces to trade their way out of it, so they're going to have to rely on building through free agency. I've been a Kings fan a long time, and that plan is a recipe for disaster. It's going to result in top free agents ignoring us for greener pastures, and is signing a bunch of long term bad contracts to maue up for a lack of better options.

If they go that route, they're going to saddle the franchise with bad contracts for a bunch of guys that aren't going to get us to compete at a high level anyway. Then Boogie is going to leave, but only after we have killed any leverage we may have had by trading him at the right time.

They gotta trade him this summer.`\When I close my eyes, I see the new arena...

edit: bonus, effortless half court shot, after the whistle`\Now if only he'd drop some Boosie`\Remember that Shaq, before he came to the Lakers, was very similar to what Boogie is right now. Not in terms of being a baby, but that he was emotionally angry and fustrated at the time. We also had Kobe who at one time wanted to leave the lakers. It took guys like Phil Jackson, Jerry West and Jerry Buss to make those two players work together and make them use the team more and work together. Boogie's fustration is something that's kind of reasonable for a team that hasn't made the playoffs since 2008, let alone have a good record (above .500).`\Meh, all his plays seem to be assists and defensive plays which can be replicated.`\but i'd take that 3 nonetheless`\Over/Under we lose by 30 with Rondo, Cousins, Gay, and Belinelli out?`\I like him`\The color commentator is pretty awesome`\I mean it was his fault for getting suspended. `\Whatever gave you that obviously correct impression?`\Like Russell said.

Ignoring the fact that LSU has been terrible and was massively overhyped by ESPN, Simmons is incredibly raw with ALOT of holes in his game. The guyis anathletic freak, but struggpes shooting the ball from pretty much anywhere except for layups and dunks, he is essentially a negative when foced into a half court offense, he gets so many rebounds because he is typically the only LSU player above 6'6" on the floor at any given time, he is turnover prone, doesn't play defense, etc.

The raw physical potential is there, but a lot more than that is needed at the NBA level.`\SHOWTIME

That, along with a few small changes can make this team a legit playoff contender next year. Which I think is probably Cousins' last year, so our last chance to try to keep him.`\Ginobili, protect your precious fragile old body!`\Yeah, but that's why the Kings should be looking for teams with expiring contracts as well as draft picks.

Boogie does need to be a professional though, on that you and I both agree. His job is to play, not dictate coaching or personnel changes, not that he ever indicated as such to anyone other than he didn't like that Karl wanted to get rid of him in such a shady way.`\hello?



^^hello?

^^^^hello?`\>Steve Kerr was supposed to become the Head Coach of the Seattle Supersonics had the Kings moved to Seattle.

Wat`\>most dysfunctional organization in sports

Ever heard of a little team called the Browns?`\Why not just get rid of Gay? Find serviceable two-way players with chip on their shoulders on affordable contracts. The problem with the Kings is that they have no identity, they have .500 talent but  .200 chemistry.`\1. Fire George Karl

2. Hire a new GM: Go out and find the best guy for the job, pay them whatever is necessary.

3. Let GM take over: Give him full autonomy to make personnel decisions. Vivek needs to back off and let basketball people do basketball things.

4. Hire a new coach: Let the new GM go out and find his guy, and the staff around him.

5. Trade Boogie: I don't think they will ever get as big of a haul for him as they can get this summer. Go out and find the best offer possible and pull the trigger. Need prospects/picks/young 2 way players.

6. Nail the Draft: Whatever picks we end up with from the Boogie trade, or even if we don't trade him, they need to use their picks wisely. No more busts.

7. Let Rondo walk: Don't think he is going to do anything but hold franchise back.

8. Shed bad contracts: Bellinelli, Rudy, Kouofs, any long contracts that can be moved at a fair price should go. No urgency here, but keep ears open for good offers. Maybe at next deadline?

9. Free Agency: The Kings have a ton of cap space, even if they don't move any contracts. They need to use this money wisely. Sacramento has always overpaid midrange free agents with bad contracts. Can't afford to do that.

10. Change the culture: Bring in a defensive-minded staff that is going to run an offense that actually makes sense for the roster. Stop the coaching carousel. Get some smart people in places to do smart things. Vivek needs to back off.`\I really like all the players on our team.`\Dirk holding back cousins on the rebound and that isn't a foul?!

I'd take the Celts pick straight up if he wanted out and was willing to hold out. If that Nets pick is 1 or 2, it's probably the best thing we could get anyways. Simmons and Ingram have potential to be franchise players. I don't even think we could get back a top 30 player for DeMarcus.

In all honesty, from the Celts, the only thing I'd want is: Nets pick (1st or 2nd overall)+Bradley+Crowder. I'd be willing to throw in McLemore/role players and maybe even Gay. If Cousins is gone, so is Gay.

If things don't go well for Cleveland, don't be surprised to start hearing BS rumors about Love for Cousins this offseason. `\Are there any players or coaches that you wish you had had a chance to play with before you retired?`\I was checking box score and thought we would've won for sure :'( wtf happened`\Yes it is.`\>  the day after fhe Warriors beat their opponent, the Sac Bee Sport section had not 1 word about the game, nor even a box score.

Hope you guys can get your team back together considering the coach, the FO, and the player chemistry are just a gigantic mess.

Point being if Charlotte wants to make a move for a superstar player, they can. Sounds like it's not that much of a stretch at all.

This is never something you should have to say about a coach. He shouldn't have to have a certain type of player to succeed. He should be able to adjust his coaching style to the roster he has. `\99 is a lot more recent than 51`\I don't think Sacramento would straight up swap the two, also it wouldn't be possible due to the salary difference. I think without a third team the trade would have to be at minimum: Ben Simmons, Julius Randle and Brandon Bass to make salaries work without making Sacramento take on Lou or Nick's contracts which I highly doubt they'd do.`\What makes you think this? Has Boogie said something recently about not liking Vlade, or trusting him? He is the one running the show. As far as I know his only issues are with Karl, and rightfully so.

Remember Cousins recent 1-game suspension? When asked about it he was clear to not blame the the organization which has been completely loyal to. Here is his quote regarding the suspension -

>"That wasn't a suspension from the organization. That was a suspension from the head coach"`\He's the pg I want most. I think he'd be amazing with this team.`\I can't see us making that big a trade for someone with perceived character issues after what happened with Lance and Coach Clifford, as great as Cousins is.`\Steve ALbert knows all about pheasant hunting`\Gentry has been absolutely atrocious. Lots of our fans are still holding out hopes saying "He's been dealt a shit hand with all the injuries", but it's not just about the losses. It's about the way he coaches.

Anderson-Davis lineup is for sure our most frequent lineup.

But Anderson has a big chance to be gone this offseason and Poeltl is a defensive stud with a decent offensive game that fits great next to AD. We could potentially have the best defensive backcourt in the league in a couple years with him. But I'd still prefer one of Simmons, Ingram, or Brown. `\Now if only he can get back to that playoff defense I saw last year.`\What else is happening?`\Amazing how that works.  You'd think they'd try it all the time. `\> you want to keep Tyreke and Jrue?

He and AD can be a great pick/roll/pop duo for years to come.`\Honestly deserves the 3rd team, they'll give it to Drummond or Jordan though.`\God bless you Sacramento. `\Welcome to Kings games, where NBA officials in training practice their shit calls!`\Rudy gay is kawhi's original nemesis in the NBA. Dunked on him hard the first time they met, and has played him hard ever since`\Yes, had to re open it`\Weak fucking calls`\Cousins went from averaging 23 to 28. I am pretty sure his stock is even higher`\Who are the top 3 centres in the NBA? I'd argue KAT is in the top 3.`\Exactly. Their biggest negative since drafting Tim Duncan was a transitioning Richard Jefferson.`\That might have been the most violent crossover I've seen in a long time.`\It's hard. We don't have a young core that we can grow to a playoff level like the Wolves.

We also don't have good picks because we traded a lot of our picks away in the past few years.

I would try to trade Cousins this summer for two good 2-way players and maybe some picks. I would also get Rudy Gay off his contract.

That's the start of what I would do this off season. I'd see how the team plays with this and see what else needs to be changed. But I really don't see us in a playoff position in a long long time.`\Hey Peja,
How did you feel about your time in Toronto?
Also, PUNJABI!`\Hey peja I recently saw you sitting with vlade at a picnic table near sleep train arena before the recent Kings vs Pelicans game, I was literally so amazed be able to see you because I've been a kings my entire life, but once I approached you I accidentally called you Vlade instead of Peja , I still feel very ashamed about that so I came here too apologize. `\Byron should be fired immediately after the game for continuing to play Kelly at the 3.`\Wow`\And look where that's gotten Lebrons team`\4 blocks is risky.

He's played 33% more minutes this year and averaging about a half more PPG and RPG along with regressing in blocks.


He's a piece you ask for in in a 3/4 man haul as a "hey fuck it, he's young there's a tiny chance he can be serviceable bench big some day and I'm sure they wouldn't really give a fuck throwing him in there if we show the smallest amount of second guessing " type deal because one of the teams wanted just a little bit more and Portland is like "eh shit why not, he's been absolute shit his career, makes me appreciate Thomas Robinson more, so why the fuck not? We need so and so player and we don't want trade talks to become complicated over something like Noah fucking Vonleh, let's do it".....not as the piece to make up the unfathomable difference in CJ and Cousins value.`\Fun game so far it looks like.`\Cousins would fail so hard in a large market like LA. `\Don't know if they said anything in the broadcast but I was at the game sitting behind the bench and the whole first half Reggie Jackson was puking in a trash can when he was off the court. Told us he was sick, and still nearly put up a triple double`\I know still want to see him play though.`\But Cousins didn't have issues with Malone, even if he did have a tendency to get upset on the court. `\lmao collison tryna square up to bron`\ I dont want you monkey mouth motherfuckers sittin' in my throne again. `\The Kings need to lose out the rest of their game and try to go for Ingram or a top prospect. I'm serious about this because there's literally no hope on this team.

Imagine if the Kings finish out 37-44... lose our top 10 protected pick to the Bulls, miss out on the playoffs, and resign Rondo to a near-max with all of our cap to keep Cousins happy and do another playoff push...

Same shit, different year. I'm really getting tired of this team.. Kings fans have nothing to look forward to. The only thing we can do is pray that Cousins doesn't demand a trade. `\Trade Cousins to the Celtics for David Lee, James Young, and a 2nd round pick. ^^^^^/s

In reality though, they definitely need to try to build through the draft. Making a call to some teams with high picks and assets would be where you start. `\there goes Kawhis lead on 3pt %`\this is 60s ball`\I thought 3 games behind meant the playoffs...oops`\wonder who the starters are

Parker/Simmons?/Kawhi/West/Boban?`\That's like the 6th slip this game. What's up with the court?`\I would like a big mobile defender who can hit a mid range to outside shot.

I'm just talking about in terms of his value as a prospect. 23 is young, but as far as the NBA is concerned he basically is what he is at this point. He's very talented, but he's drawing dead at becoming a superstar. He will probably never be an all star either.

If you're trading away a superstar like Boogie, you either want guys that are already at All Star level, or multiple young prospects that have some superstar potential. Val is neither of those things.`\That's the same foul Cousins got away with`\What did he say in the post game interview?`\Kings are hard to watch`\everyone making fun of that thompson contract but he looks more worth the money than love lol.`\How does this make Boogie a horrible teammate?

You can make the logical leap and say that having an issue with his coach makes him a bad teammate, but I haven't heard much about Boogie having issues with teammates.`\Hi, Peja.

Kelly 0/4 tonight, this guy just doesn't get it... meanwhile SACGOD 4/4.`\With the game on the line, Perk with the block!`\Has the worst attitude of a legitimate franchise player that I've ever seen. Several times a year, every year for half a dozen seasons this has been going on. I don't know exactly what he did this time, but at this point, after so many incidents, what's a 1 game suspension and a soon-to-follow half assed apology going to do for this floundering organization? `\Why should the Kings trade him right now when the best thing we could get in return is the Nets pick which will be around 5? I heavily watch college and int. ball. Unlike last year where your first 5 picks were almost guaranteed to be potential franchise players, this year, there's only 2.

Would the Kings really trade Cousins for someone like Jamaal Murray who has a lot of unknowns? Hell no. Might as well keep him until his final year and try to get something then.

Makes absolutely 0 sense to unload him right now. His value isn't high right now either.

What major asset are you talking about here? Again, can the Kings even get back a top 30 player for him that has at least 2 years left on their contract? Because that's an asset. A combo of Nets pick+Kelly Olynk is trash.

If the Kings are trading him this year, it better be for a deal like Lakers' pick+Russell.  `\hell no I wouldn't want him, been saying it for awhile now. There is more to success than talent, and apart from talent he hasn't shown much else`\The crowd is booing`\Then they're dumb. `\They'd be lucky to win 30.`\At time this season DeMarcus needed to help himself and check himself, he isn't blameless but no one in this organization is.`\25 turnovers.`\So because Love doesn't fight back its ok...`\lebron doin' it all`\LIFE IS OVERRATED`\wow Boban is faster than Cousins coming down the court`\That might be the least logical sequence I've ever seen from a coach.`\Rockets suck`\I hadn't thought of that connection... but you're right.

Ran Kelly and Sacre? Where is Brandon Bass, Tarik Black, or Larry Nance?`\Rondo, wtf.`\Don't make the same mistake like you guys did with Andrew Bynum.`\My reasoning is that they haven't gotten a prime FA in a while and after the CP3 non trade they haven't traded for any stars either. They have Byron Scott as their coach and have had one of the worst records over the last 3 years even with Kobe. The Lakers aren't just one guy away from competing, they are like 2 or 3. Until they have a more established team I can't see them grabbing any of the elite players hitting the market or trading for prime players for cheap.

I think you are overrating the LA factor because LA is only super attractive when the team is good. Kobe was a big reason why they were able to get stars cheap and with him gone they don't have a MVP caliber/reputation player to help lead the team. You need 2 or 3 star players to win in this league and it's super hard to convince elite guys to leave their teams for one without another star player they can team up with.

You can point to history as your basis for LA still being just as influential today as they were over the last 30 years, but I'll point to their lack of star player acquisitions over the last 3 seasons and their franchise worst win records to go along with it as my proof.

I have two questions for you:

1. If you had to compare yourself to one player in today's league, who would it be and why?

2. What is your opinion on the officiating of the 2002 Western Conference Finals, specifically Game 6?

Thank you!
`\Yeah, and Tyreke averaged 20-5-5 his rookie season. Randle can't shoot and can only play PF. He should improve as he gets older, but he's gonna have to add a new jumper to his game to get above average at his position.

PER is an efficiency stat that is used to counter the point about shooting 44% from the field.

He also has Whiteside and Kanter ahead of him, both of which I would put behind Boogie in overall play.

Also, please read. We can argue about BS rankings all day....I could care less.

Maybe he's #10, maybe #15, maybe #20.

Still doesn't mean that 2 average players for him (Randle and Clarkson) would ever be a fair trade, let alone "too much to give up" for Demarcus.`\To ask question.`\Is that not enough for you for a rebuilding team?

Why have to rebuild when you could become an instant contender? We've all seen J.R. at his best - when he's sinking 11 threes in a single game. I believe that this J.R. Smith could become the normal J.R. Smith, but tapping into that power is no easy task. You'd need to put him on a team where he is the #1 option. A team where he can take at least half of his team's shots, most of them contested. By catering to J.R.'s every whim (providing free weed, sending women of his choice to his quarters at his request, etc.) and focusing all of the franchise's resources on extracting his hidden potential, there's a chance you could end up with the ultimate basketball player on your hands. I'm not saying it's a sure thing, but I think there's a good chance that a basketball god (of which we've seen mere flashes) lies within J.R. Smith, and that that god can be brought to the surface in the right environment.

>> `\For fucks sake George just give Willie more minutes.`\cousins looks like he just wants to go home and eat some ice cream `\This sounds weird but we lost this game ny constantly insisting  on going to Dirk. He's not shooting well and we're failing to realize that Parsons is our best player`\Angry Wes Matthews...yeesh!`\doesn't work in Australia`\It's the Lakers you're playing who are absolutely atrocious this game.

Dunno why someone downvoted you though...`\I agree with this for sure.

We have good lineups. The bench has no source of offense though and our lineups don't help that much.

Bellinelli is cold, but he's also shooting everything coming off of down screens. If he could spot up in the corners he might be useful, but our offense doesn't create those shots.

Our main issue is the SG position. We are one wing away from going to the next level and a decent Koufos replacement from being decent.

Maybe we can get lucky in the draft or nab one in FA.

And a new coach.`\Look at their respective contracts.`\The Kings really gotta trade Cousins. He can put up numbers, but right now this team can't go on with this core. It just can't. I don't know if it stems from the management being an emberassment in general, or if it comes from the players' culture (none of them showing up for practice, even if it's optional you gotta be there), but right now this is awful. Zero effort on defense, 8 seconds or less offense that Karl used while in the Nuggets that leads to big numbers some games...i don't know, just bad basketball. `\Hi!  I go for the Pistons.`\Agh, I know I'm way too late now, but I had work and missed this. Your team gave me some of the best moments of my childhood growing up in Sacramento.

And in case you ever come back to the AMA to answer some lingering questions, here it is. What do you think is the next step in building our team to further improve and boost us to playoff-level quality? I feel like our talent level is close to or already at that of a playoff caliber team, but there's something missing that sparks us towards actually achieving that goal.`\man that sequence was so kings`\I never said he wasn't.

I'm just disagreeing with your statement that Draymond would be just another dude if he wasn't on the Warriors.`\WCS has been awesome all season but can someone clarify for me what happened to lead to his -14 +/- in 5 minutes.`\Why did I turn this game on`\ut oh cousins`\**Edit** - in case anyone cares, there was a long comment here about how Cousins was unfairly scapegoated while the Kings' dysfunction was ignored.  It said that everyone here and in the media failed to attribute any blame to the Kings, and instead criticized Cousins for things that Kobe used to do.  It then said that Cousins would succeed with every other franchise in the league.  Pretty fascinating stuff, I know, but I just personally hate it when a comment with replies to it is deleted.  **End Edit** ***


People give the Kings' organization a pass?  Seriously?  The Kings' front office is regularly shit on by everyone in the media and everyone here.  I've never seen anyone defend them.  I'd be really interested to read any credible articles defending the Kings as far as the Cousins situation goes.  Even the article OP linked, which is about as negative as you can get towards Cousins, does not try to deflect the blame.  Aileen Voisin wrote an article in the Sacramento Bee two days ago again reminding us that the Kings fucked up by firing Malone, and that the players have tuned out Karl.  Not exactly scapegoating Cousins.

You're "100% sure Cousins would not have issues at any other franchise"?  So, he'd be perfectly well-behaved on the 76ers, Nets, Pelicans, Magic, Suns, Lakers?  How about playing on the Rockets with all their fantastic chemistry?  How would he like playing for the Knicks, given the way that franchise is run?  Clippers would be great considering Doc Rivers and Cousins' relationship with Chris Paul.  I'm sure they'd love him in Utah.

And you keep bringing up how Kobe was a bad teammate.  Why is that helpful?  Just because it happened before doesn't make it right.`\Agree to disagree`\Checked the box score on Yahoo only to find:

* :06.7 Sacramento SAC Technical foul on Rajon Rondo
* :06.7 Sacramento SAC Technical foul on Rajon Rondo
* :06.7 Sacramento SAC Technical foul on DeMarcus Cousins

Yep, it's a Kings game.`\Collison 4th Quarter meltdown again`\What bar in DTLA would be good to forget this game ever happened?`\Gay and Cousins are your real valuable trade pieces. Collison may net you something, WCS has potential. That's about all the value on their roster. But yes, they're not Nets-level fucked `\Put Delly back in that dude is so fun to watch fuck kevin love lol.`\I hope you guys improve. On the other hand, I hope we're fighting higher than the eighth seed next year.`\...er Chamberlain or...`\This is a wonderful image you've painted, thank you`\I don't fully disagree, but he's gotten markedly more mature as time has gone on, despite his situation being consistently dysfunctional.  And his 'antics' have never spilled out onto the floor or public, like a Morris twin choking out a teammate, or Okafor getting into bar brawls.  But he somehow has a worse rep than both those guys despite the worst being whining at refs or getting into a heated argument.`\Hood!  `\Classic Kings, make a comeback just to fall apart in the last few minutes.`\This is like 8 calls against us in the last 5 minutes.`\Still surprised we won.

Superstars lead their team to more than 30 wins in a season.  Come on.  The numbers are nice, okay.  He's an all star, not a superstar.  There is a big, big difference.  Lebron is a superstar.  Curry is a superstar.  Demarcus Cousins is not a superstar.`\Yeah for the sake of the rest of the West and league, let's not do that.  `\If we did this deal we'd just be sac but worse`\YOU GOT KNOCK THE FUCK OUT...MANNNNN`\Marco? Was that you?`\Ok that makes sense, thank you for your prompt and complete response. `\LOLOLOLOL`\Are the Cavs tanking for the 2nd seed?`\Did your team get nervous at the end of the games in that 2002 series versus the Lakers?`\DAT WCS FADEAWAY!!!!!`\It's my unbiased, "just enjoying watching games" side talking. My Blazer-homer side hopes both Dallas and Houston go down in flames for the rest of the season.`\Come on Seth. Get shwifty!`\I love watching both of these teams.

Orlando has so much exciting young talent. Hezonjia, Gordon, Oladip. Sac has Boogie and Rondo.

I'm also high as fuck.`\HE'S MAD`\I think the kings thrown in McLemore and it's a pretty good deal for both sides. I think Wall and Cousins would be fun to watch again. `\Like this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UFNcQSQ0QIQ

But seriously, exactly as it's spelled, Peh-jah. Instead I get pay-jah, peajah, or pasia.

`\Booker single-handedly ruining anyone in a 9 cat league`\goddamit it boogie CHILL pls `\Does Sacramento know what Defense is`\Plus they were supposed to be contenders`\it just never ends...`\Not a leader, I don't think so... but he can be the second guy that the team relies on.

I think a strong vetetan star like LBJ or Wade could bring the best of him.

Guys like Pierce, Kg and Kobe could have done that 3 or 4 years ago`\Glad to see some ball movement`\I don't think the team is looking to make moves just for the sake of making moves.

We'll probably keep Jrue and Reke until we get done with the draft. I've heard rumors that we won't be pursuing Gordon, but I think it would be a terrible idea not to resign him. I'd love to see Ryan come back, and there's a chance. But it's less than likely.

I think everything depends on where we land in the draft.

Top 3 and we're looking to resign our guys and make a push with our new wing player (exactly what we need the most for this team).

6, 7, or 8 (much more likely) I think we look to draft Jakob Poeltl and go after a wing player in free agency.

Biggest change I'm hoping for but know won't happen is Gentry leaving our team (whether it's a firing or retiring I don't care). He's a bad coach and I'd prefer to see what Erman can do as our head coach. `\Keep Boogie for next year and try to compete.

There is no reason to not try to compete next season. Kings can trade Boogie at the deadline if it's not working.

If Rondo is gone, gotta make some moves in FA. A lot of people would say it's dumb, but overpay for young FA.

As much as we don't want shitty contracts, just in case we trade Boogie and rebuild, that's why the FA's must be young. To get a FA to come to Sac, the contract will always be an overpay. Just make sure you're overpaying 25 year olds and not 32 year olds.

Target guys like Parsons, Barnes, Batum, Ryan Anderson, Conley, Bazemore, Eric Gordon (might be cheap), Chalmers, Teletovic. We need wings who can shoot or play defense.

See what we can get for Rudy. I love Rudy and he's on a decent contract coming up (people will try to tell you otherwise, but $13M/yr for Rudy is a solid deal), but he's not a good enough shooter to play the 3 with Boogie and he can't play the 4 for extended periods of time, coupled with WCS needing more playing time, means Rudy will be the 3.

Surround Boogie with shooters and play a slower pace and we might have a shot to improve even without Rondo, who is playing well, but will not be as big of a loss as people think.

Whoever we target as a coach will be most important. Target Thibs first. We won't get him, but who gives a shit if Vivek pays the guy $10M/yr. Can't think of other coach options right now, but defense and a slower pace are what we need to succeed. We don't need to grind them out, but we cannot keep running with Boogie as our main piece.

If things go wrong, explore trades for Demarcus, but I could care less about getting something back for him. Whatever it is will most likely not improve the team much and most likely hamstring us to more mediocrity by sticking with those guys instead of blowing it up for a rebuild.

Stories of our future picks situation have been far overblown. Technically, we have the pick to Chicago and the pick to the Sixers currently out there. The pick swaps with the Sixers shouldn't hurt too bad even if we gave them up because the Sixers should still have decent picks coming up that we would get back.

I know this is late and will get buried, but the FO needs to take it one step at a time. See what moves can get done this offseason and see what happens with a new playing style and then we can talk about moving Boogie at the deadline for the right deal.

Also, a deal for Boogie should include at least 1 top 5 pick, 1 lottery pick/young player with potential, 1 more rotation piece (6th or 7th man at least) and future picks to be rendered.

If we're not getting assurance of a top 5 pick back or a player with some potential, then it is a no go. I'd rather see him leave in FA and say goodbye to $30M+ with the Bird Rights than see us roll out a team of Collison, Bradley, Rudy, Sullinger and WCS with Marcus Smart coming off the bench.`\Sacre!`\Just hoping for some interesting games. 20+ point shellackings aren't as interesting, regardless of who wins.`\and yet /r/nba bashes the Cavs non-stop for giving TT his contract`\Then you aren't getting him`\I stand corrected.`\wrong Booker `\Thank you Kings. Pelicans are essentially locked into the 5/6 spots now. Its lit.`\Come on man :( `\bulls and pistons just wont lose`\Curry is 27.  He wasn't as good at 23.  Careful with the too old to change thing.  Even Jordan changed up his game later in his career to become one of the best defenders ever.`\Kings don't give a shit about draft picks`\Yea I saw the three`\After seeing last year's playoffs I would think John Wall will take over.

Zaza is playing like shit and McGee sitting there and sitting there...`\I guess you can say that you can......blame it on the boogie`\There were so many.

`\Called it a 2`\Too late to tank ?`\Cauley-Stein almost nailed that alley.`\Fuck this shit.`\Cousins for Russell? That's a trade rape`\Realistically, I don't think we have the assets to get him anyway.  But yeah, you could definitely make melo / cousins work as long as you had a competent PG rotation.  Something phil has failed to provide.`\They offered four first round picks for Justise Winslow...

And a lineup of potentially

* Smart
* Bradley
* FA Small Forward
* Amir
* Boogie

OR

* Bradley
* Young/Rozier/Hunter (whichever develops)
* Chrowder
* Amir
* Boogie

Plus they have about $25 million in cap space to sign a SF like Harrison Barnes or Chandler Parsons or Nicholas Batum in situation 1 or sign a PG or SG like Conley or DeRozan in situation 2.


Plus still having all the rest of the Brooklyn Picks (outside of this year) to fill out the roster?

Celtics would have to consider that...

edit: I thought it was called shooting, probably still bad.`\fuck yeah`\Might not have been called without the headband too.`\I think that haul is ok, but I'd certainly expect a lot more for a top 10 talent who has potential to be a top 10 player. He's just terrible as the leader of any team.. he can be your best player, but he can't be your leader.

I don't think the Kings trade him unless we get a real fair offer on the table. If we traded with Boston, I'd want Bradley, Crowder, Nets 2016 pick, Boston 2017 pick(can swap with Nets), and Nets 2018 pick.

The Kings would probably throw in McLemore and a few role players.

This would be the only price I'd be willing to accept from the Celts unless their pick falls in the top 2. That pick loses a crap ton of value after 2, which is why I'd want the 2017 and 18 picks too. `\What do you think of the game today evolving towards the perimeter? Everyone late to the party?`\But that's the problem. A good-great defender is engaged on almost every possession, they'll get a pass for one or two bad ones here and there. But if you're only engaged half the time then you're no more than a mediocre defender. James Harden can play some damn good D when he tries but he rarely does so he gets shit on constantly here, why should Boogie get a pass?`\Trade Cousins and Rudy Gay for 15 young players.

Haha I mean we're probably gonna be keeping that pick and Pau is a UFA so it's essentially Boogie/Ben for snell and a 2nd rounder. That trade would be awesome for Chicago but it would literally never happen. `\Do you guys think Karl will be a head coach in the NBA after this season?+`\Nah we want 8 unless we can somehow get the 5th seed (I mean it's still possible)

That can be measured by his technical fouls, the way he treats his coach, and the way he acts around his teammates.

He against Lue would be very entertaining.`\I just went to the one in Roseville last weekend and they have Kevin Martin's foot imprint framed on the wall and autographed.`\I'd trade everyone and start from scratch. I'd try to trade Boogie to a franchise with a questionable recent track record that's quite far away from contending, prey on the (other) weak for their picks. A team like the Suns or the Nuggets are also rebuilding and if you can get 2 firsts and someone like Booker or Jokic, you get good young players and the picks you get are likelier to be in the lottery. Then I'd try to get a pick that would end up somewhere around 12-20 range for Rudy Gay, probably not gonna happen that easy, so I'd be willing to include DC or Casspi to sweeten the deal and maybe even take a big contract that's hopefully expiring. I'd part with every player except for expiring deals, try to get as many picks as possible to start fresh. The only player I may be willing to keep is Ben McLemore, but being there for the past few years may have affected him negatively as well and he may be in need of a fresh start too, so that's something I would analyze and take my time on. If any proven coach is willing to come to Sacramento, I'd be willing to adapt to their style and draft and acquire free agents accordingly following the initial year of tank that I'd be openly discussing with the candidates. However, since that seems unlikely, I'd interview not-so-well-known assistants from winning franchises, such as David Fizdale from Miami, I doubt Luke Walton would be realistic, he's a hot commodity. I don't think Pop has any super long-time assistants anymore they're all snagged up, but I would prefer somebody who spent a decent amount of time under a coach like Pop, Riley or Phil who ran successful and no-nonsense franchises. The coach has to be a very big extension of the culture I would try to build, also somebody compatible with me that I could work closely with. Hopefully this process can all get done before the draft so I can draft the right players who'd fit in the coach's and my system. Then I'd sign one or two shitty veterans with great locker presence that this coach previously worked or played with to establish that culture and look for a few hidden undrafted gems to develop. Regardless of the situation and how the rook looks, I tank into oblivion and get a top 3 pick. All these years with Cousins / including Cousins, Sacramento always picked 5-6-7 region. I try to get a top 3 pick, and build around a future superstar, who had been scouted heavily and most importantly, has the right character. Total reboot, and nothing to remind the franchise of its last 10-15 years. I'd also either try to get Shaq more involved somehow and use him as a tool. Maybe get C-Webb on board with Vlade and Peja hanging around. But also, I'd kinda sneakily work behind the scenes and try to move the team to Seattle for its larger market possibilities. With Seahawks and Sounders, it's a successful sports city as well. But nobody can know about my sneaky intentions and plans, it's super secret. `\Da title doe. `\What did you think of your time playing for Toronto?`\Porz :( so many lowlights on him tonight`\Heard it too.

They could get major assets in return.`\Bogdan Bogdanavich, no relation to Bojan on the Nets. Currently playing in Turkey,  he's doing great I hear.

I have no idea how you could argue against that.`\As much as Harpring says goofy stuff sometimes, I do appreciate that he takes back bad judgments on no calls without hesitation.`\Build around Alan Williams. `\what's the nba record for earliest garbage time?`\Peja u were my favorite player growing up. I am from Orange County and got into basketball with that kings lakers rivalry. What's your biggest shooting tip. Also just so u know my first ever email had the number 16 at the end of it cuz u that dude`\of course. Tony Brothers.`\They'll just end up drafting the next failed project and the cycle will continue. `\Doesn't change the fact that you're super close now`\How do you feel about the Kings in the next 5 years?`\Free tacos?`\Hi! I just wanted to know, when you were playing, who did you think was the flashier passer? CP3 or Jason Williams?`\lol`\Not the greatest lineup lol`\No problem Riley gave you guys a steal.

Rommel is smiling from above on that tactical masterpiece `\YAY KEVIN LOVE WOOOHOOO TWO/TWO FTS`\I will write Ted a letter.  Honestly, this season will not go in vain if both Ernie and Randy get canned.  If they return, all hope is lost.`\BRB guys gonna go watch some delly highlights.`\Sums it up pretty much. `\Griffin is killin' to be on court again. Court rules guilty. `\hard to get multiple decent 2 way players for gay. maybe one but i dont think teams will want to give up established decent 2 way players for a guy that has a history of making his teams better when he leaves. plus gay isnt great defensively and doesn't exactly stretch the floor really well. he's a good player, but more like a 3rd option on a championship winning team if anything.

might be better to just go for a total rebuild and get a couple younger players that are one dimensional and a second round pick for gay and try to fleece boston for multiple first round picks this offseason for boogie. maybe trade bellineli and collision for the best they can get and use the rest of the money to overpay more vets to help develop them since money wont be an issue.

maybe try to draft dunn or develop curry as the starting pg, keep mclemore, fill in the sg and sf spot and have stein as a starting center and go from there. `\**BASKETBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAALLLLLLLLL**`\UNFKNBLVBL`\god damn I still have homework to do why am I watching this`\Yeah I don't really care if we get swept by the Warriors I just want to be in the playoffs. `\wait...how is it supposed to be pronounced? you got me questioning myself`\Glad to see Boogie finally maturing `\You really think this team is better than okc or cavs?

Hope for the insurance payout to cover the rebuild.  It will take a while.

Dumpster fires are not always easily extinguished.`\I think Portland would actually be a really nice fit for him, even though it probably can't happen until he hits free agency in a couple years. Dame seems like an amazing leader and would be a great influence on Boogie, all the players seem to love Stotts, and perhaps most importantly he'd be winning. The Blazers are doing really well right now in spite of all the guys you lost over the offseason, but Boogie could make that team something special if they didn't have to gut it to get him. `\LMFAO RONDO`\LOL what? If demarcus cousins says he wants to go to the spurs they will do everything in their power to get him. Man this "character"  over skill argument is something out of a movie real life doesn't work like that. `\How the fuck does he not get buried in downvotes on this sub?

\- Cousins, 2016`\I wonder how Rajon Ronfo feels about the crowd booing Rajon Rondo. `\That's the "you just got your ass suspended" look.`\Just tuned in, where's knight ?
`\This was unacceptable, by all means.

However this is the coach that single handedly tried to trade him so Boogie has probably been trying to avoid doing this for a while now.

We are a mess`\Why won't the NBA go full latino during these nights? shouldn't it be Los Reyes if we want to be really Latino about this? Not sure about the word Grizzlies in Spanish though...Los Osos vs Los Reyes? `\First team to 150 wins?`\I agree it's a good offer. But for better or worse, the Kings don't care about draft picks, so it's irrelevant.

Also, if you want to get in the game of picks, Boston would probably outbid you. `\2nd highlight play from his tonight`\Kings, we should mix teams together, and take over the NBA.

Think of that lineup:

Rondo

Collison

Melo

Porzingis

Boogie
`\Just let the Andersons play one-on-one`\Sure, I agree. But the value difference between the #2 and #3 pick is not that high. I'm just saying it's comparable. `\I'm surprised that Vlade is allowing it this time,  he undermined Karl at the beginning of year by not allowing him the authority to discipline him.  `\I like it as a thing, but the hacking strategy would have to be addressed first.`\Oh yeah... I almost forgot West would start on most teams in the league.`\I couldn't believe it. I thought I was hallucinating. `\What a bunch of shitfuck`\they busted their asses last night come on. just ran out of gas`\I get your argument but I'm not sure it's that ridiculous. People are willing to put up with more antics when the team is winning. If Boogie was acting like this on a 50 win team people would be rallying around him and talking about how raw and real he is. But his team isn't winning so people don't. Winning solves most things.`\I feel like if you're the Suns, you should do that trade. I know you guys are in re-build mode, but Bledsoe has high respect from Cousins. I imagine he'll put him in check a lot.

I could see a solid playoff team with Bledsoe-Booker-Tucker-Leur-Cousins. `\*Nas is like*`\We won't trade Embiid. We will live or die with him. `\No Lebron?`\Tyus shouldn't have even come out of Duke when he did, the franchise just wanted a sentimental hometown story to sell.

He's never going to be good enough.`\We'd be giving up too much. Yes, Cousins is a top 10 player, but Randle and Clarkson are looking like solid players with potential to be even better than that. `\=| Cousins is normally clutch. Just a little off each time. `\Stop putting shitty players with shit attitudes around Cousins? Put mentor players around him and solid veterans without attitudes that can keep him level and that team is winning 50 games easy. That or hit the reset button and get rid of Cousins, Rondo and Gay. `\This is embarrassing. `\Keep the tradition alive, get the 4th seed!!! `\This is actually not that bad for Kings basketball.`\Kyrie has got his 3-pt shot back.`\Everyone blames George Karl for the Kings shitty defense, but they just don't even give an effort to get back. 3 fast break layups in a row with a foul on that last one. Simply because they were lazy in transition.`\idk that a dmc 3 is what we should be going for at this time`\Laces out, Koufos! >:(`\Mario noooo....`\About time they did something about him, he's not bigger than the team.`\CMON SPURS GINO ALREADY ICED HIS BALLS`\I'm not sure if I saw it clearly, but did Ryan Anderson stop Dermarcus Cousins at the rim?`\cavs went supa small.`\Do you expect them to be loud when they're playing like this? They were literally booing the team earlier.`\Hey Peja, just wanted to say thanks for all the memories man! You were my favorite player growing up and you made me really fall in love with the game. My questions are:

Is there any specific game that stands out as the most important game for you? (Not just NBA games specifically.)

Who was your favorite head coach in your career?

What is your favorite meal of all time? (Maybe one Serbian dish, one worldwide aha)

What city/arena did you enjoy playing in the most?

Thanks!
`\We could get so many 3 point opportunities if Lopez was able to pass the ball out of the post.`\We're horrible `\The team is located in Sacramento.  Even if the Kings were a playoff team, Sacramento is still one of the least desirable cities for a NBA player to willingly choose.  This isn't anything new, it has been like this forever.

Your response still didn't prove you know what a headcase is.  `\Boogie making good passes so far this game`\No they had to give it 1 more real shot with Boogie for this year. `\Obviously, he doesn't need to become Curry and very likely won't.  But he's merely starting to explode into the next level.  He'll only get better in the next 5 years similar to how Curry got better once he turned 25.

Hence I stated hit his prime and drew a comparison to Curry.`\I hate when people don't shoot full court shots with 2 secs left `\Yeah that actually seriously blows my mind. He was an amazing piece of that team.`\"you only lose often"`\Reddit back?  Nice coast to coast drive by Towns.`\Fucking MEMPHIS is about to drop 60 on us in a half.  That's how you know our defense is fucking garbage.`\Gonna need to ramp up the defense if we want to secure the win tonight`\To be honest we really haven't played much of anyone since he's been out. We're getting by on effort, I'm not sure if we have the skill to match up with any of the good-to-great teams. `\That's a different guy, mang.`\Damn Rudy Gay is getting paid.`\i loled
`\Lakers are not doing that trade.  Maybe Randle OR Russell with the pick, not all 3. `\Don't worry about what I'm doing `\haha omg i dont think ive ever seen someone so salty and take a loss so bad. do you not have any family on easter? do you need a hug? lol`\Crabb3!!!`\He posted a thread a few hours before this one that essentially was about how the Kings should trade Cousins now, before it's too late.`\Lol what the hell`\Isn't he an unrestricted free agent this summer anyway? Even if they did move him at the deadline no one was giving them a first for him `\MAANNNNUUUUUU`\WCS!`\I'm completely confident the kings will come back and make this competitive and... or not fuck it whatever`\Did you mess up on the wings or is Hayward actually starting at SG?`\I can't believe he called Cousins a terrible *person* and no amount of charity he does would counter his minor immaturity issues. What a ridiculous thing to say.`\Whatd he say?`\Our most important player is still out there. `\However true that is, you don't blow up on your coach sitting on the bench. There's a time and place to deal with issues and putting him on blast in front of every teammate and asst coach, along with everyone in the crowd within earshot, is ridiculous.`\You can switch your allegiance to the Warriors. No one will blame you.`\hey now`\Dont have a white 2 guard ... letting us down.`\Not having perimeter defense makes it way too easy for teams to be clutch against us`\As of this season, yeah we are. But a lot can go wrong esp this early into the rebuild. I hope we can be patient, I mean look at the Celtics.`\Boogie would be perfect on the Raps; he would fit right in with the spacing-oriented offense that your team implements and he's solid on defense`\Masai is a thief when it involves Dolan, let's be honest...`\Rubio > Rondo `\Props to King James. Almost any other player who gets hit like that is on the ground crying and Acy gets ejected.`\Lou Will is my least favorite Laker `\Boogie and Butler to LAC for Blake. `\Trade Cousins to the Celtics for the Brooklyn pick, a future first or 2 and 1 starter (Bradley or Crowder preferably).`\But Kings owned them in 2013-14`\God. Fucking. Damnit Kings...`\omg that 3 made me hype.`\dirk looks bad this game`\I personally don't think that's enough, have to have a guaranteed star prospect after Love set the precedent`\You see some messed up shit.

`\There's a good chance the shitty jobs you worked at didn't offer you millions of dollars. Boogie just has a shitty attitude overall and this is even before joining the Kings. He needs to get his attitude in check before he actually hurts the people around him and himself (career wise). `\omg these HEB commercials`\fuckin hell Kyrie Irving.`\Every time they come up in a conversation I can't help but laugh.`\Game 5, when Shaq had 5 fouls going into the 4th quarter on mostly offensive fouls?  Kobe playing through crunch time after Shaq fouled out with 5 fouls, barely misses the final shot with Bobby Jackson tugging his jersey down.

> Free throw disparity could mean the kings were more aggressive throughout the series?

Here's my view on free throws for the series.  If you asked the Kings, all you need to do is shoot a better free percentage than Shaq and you'll win, do you think they could do it? Nope.`\West obliterated Rondo with that screen `\Belinelli using trade secret.`\Just come to the Celtics already`\Always love the early afternoon games. Let's hope for an entertaining game!`\Hard to say, depends on the team like you laid out in your scenario. I'd be happy with just picks (under the right combo) or picks and a player(s).

`\lol you should see what a few Lakers' fans are saying in the thread about Cousins' quote from yesterday.

They think giving up any 2 of those 3 players is too much for a top 10 player in the league...even though Clarkson and Randle are average at their positions.

But my poor feels. `\that jr celebration needs to be a thing`\Yeah I don't disagree but it also wouldn't surprise me if Boogie pulled a Dwight and basically came out and said he will only play for certain teams. That would dramatically cut down on his market value.

For example, would you want him on orl if he publicly said he wanted to be traded to LA or Chi? You would have to worry about his attitude the whole time and you probably wouldn't make your best offer. I can see this scenario playing out knowing how much bad blood there is and how vindictive boogie seems to be.`\You're getting rid of Kobe and adding Cousins, that leaves $10m still.`\I wouldn't worry too much. With more reps i think both Wiggins, KAT and Shabazz will be reliable from 3pt range while Tyus' attempts probably increases.

I also think Gorgui and Rubio might become reliable from 3pt range. `\George Karl like " why cant i ever have a Kawhi Leonard"`\> probably the best center in the league

All things considered, I'd rather have drummond, and it's not really close. I wouldn't want anything to do with a 27 year old with the maturity of a 4 year old.

Did he have to rest his frontcourt against one the best centers in NBA?`\I gotchoo fam`\I wish I was even half as passionate about something as Buck is about travels`\Yeah man, because he's a human fucking being first, and a ballplayer second. Yeesh. `\Assuming you have the #5 pick and Pelicans have #3. Do you trade Gay and your pick for #3?

Unlikely scenario but if it happens`\the kings dont even pretend to play defense`\Trade cousins and try to get some young guns who can bring excitement. One of the major issues is the instability in the Kings' franchise, because it will be difficult to lure free agents on long term deals, so you're going to have to see what you can get from trades.`\I think you're also slightly underestimating Len's potential.  He's still young and raw but has slowly started emerging as an agile rebounding monster with a developing 18 footer.

He's not fantastic yet but he's shown flashes.`\Let's do a multiple team trade where we give up Trey Burke and get John wall`\It's working. I can see your guys comments. `\unusual move? thats what people do when theyre trying to get a foul on a defender in the air, have you ever seen the NBA recently?`\Felt bad for the security guard he pushed`\Lamarcus has a migraine. TD and green have had too many minutes and would have been three games in four nights If they had played tonight`\Cavs really gave up on that fastpaced style and defense along with it`\I still really like Ben. I know he's streaky and inconsistent, but the dude plays hard and when he's on he is so fun to watch. I wish we had a coach who utilized and shaped young players instead of old man Karl.

I was a big Karl supporter but I'll be the first to say he has been shit. `\macklemore!!`\AD doesn't have shit to do with this. Cousins is really immature, but I think things might have gone better for him if we weren't the most dysfunctional organization in sports. To vilify Cousins for being inmature just because some other player in the league is more mature is ridiculous though.`\Sacrifice Belinelli to the basketball gods in order to get the second pick in the lottery behind PHI.

Edit: On a serious note, hope Brooklyn wins the lottery, trade Cousins to Boston for a package of #1 pick + some young guys like Smart and Olynyk. Trade Gay for a high first round pick and a bag of spicy nacho Doritos. Do whatever it takes to get Belinelli off the roster. Draft Hield with our pick. Develop the core of Smart/Hield/3+D guy under the age of 24/Simmons/WCS`\Cousins and Whiteside should be #1 and #2 for sure.

Great word! I'm gonna use that more often..`\I doubt Portland management would be interested in Cousins.  They have been very wary of players with any kind of character concerns ever since the jailblazers era. `\There is really no conceivable offer for Cousins other than Drummond. Hypothetically if you did have the two of them you'd never have the speed on D to cover and Drummond already struggles enough switching, doubling or getting to the weak side effectively. There's been talk of Drummond mailing in games all season.

I honestly haven't seen enough from Drummond yet to think his ceiling is any higher than DeAndre Jordan's and I'm not too optimistic about making him the richest player in the franchise's history. `\Vaguely remember that play but we had way more problems that I clearly remember from that night. Everyone went invisible in the 2nd half and over relied on Boogie. Boogie made the decision to foul out of frustration on an insignificant non-call that led to him fouling out. An intentional and shitty decision irks me more than a poorly executed play or bad release on a shot. IMO, he's helped keep us in more games than lose them. `\Holy shit what an outlet pass!`\Pshh you act like the warriors win a lot. Clearly draymond is just far more levelheaded. `\that's not how this works. you don't think there is such a thing as spreads and single game betting? lol`\I'd like the Knicks to get a superstar through a trade while keeping the core of Melo and Kristaps and preferably any good young role players...`\No Curry?`\Belinelli didn't even put effort into trying to beat the shot clock, lmao`\FYI Bobby Jackson and Doug Christie work for the Kings and do the post-game show on local TV.`\Congrats Jazz.

We don't have a cohesive offense that involves him because we just use him as some sort of gadget player. There doesn't appear to be any interest in incorporating him. It's either stand at the 3 pt line and wait for a pass or just dump it to him in the post and get out of the way. That isn't an offense.`\BOBAN V DMC. ROUND 1.

Some fans were thrilled that they kept losing in order to get more ping pong balls.  Finished with the worst record, ended up with the worst possible pick (4th).

I feel better win they win, but then again I probably take this team a little bit too seriously.`\yeah it seems like they would know what they have in Cousins already.`\Vlade Divac is my favorite basketball player of all-time.

I feel like if Lebron or Durant went to the Magic they would be the Warriors.

Celts have plenty to throw in if they want to do it. If the draft rumors were true of 4 picks for Winslow then it's entirely possible they put a major package together. Redditors might even call it an overpay but it wouldn't surprise me.

Otherwise I think only way he gets traded is if Boogie demands it and forces his way to a major market like Lakers (for clarkson and randle and something else) or clips (for Blake). I would love to see this because I'm a lakers fan and a kings fan and I really think Boogie needs a change of scenery more than anything else.`\No more Kobe contract, it'd work fine`\yeah im totally not!!!!!!!!`\When there's 1/10 of a second left on the shot clock and you're inbounding, are you allowed to throw the ball at the defender's feet and force a kicked ball violation, resetting the shot clock to 14?`\Perhaps a win tonight... please`\Gonna be a nail-biting season finish.`\Markeiff and Demarcus can fight the powers that be!

Get a proven coach then you're truly set for the next 10 years. Obviously, it's not the best case for them since they've been missing the playoffs for already a long time but it gives them the chance to properly rebuild. I don't know why a free agent would be interested in Sacramento. As for the Lakers, they get someone to really attract free agents but I don't think they would trade pretty much their future for Cousins although Russell would still be here.`\Also, Boogie and Towns both have enough range to coexist on the offensive end.`\Honestly just trade Cousins and get it over with.`\Went to high school near Dallas, played at Baylor, and is a huge Cowboys fan.

to have answers to this one.

What is up with this picture?

 - Did you get conned by an agent who promised fortune and fame?
 - Who picked that wardrobe?
 - Is that a streetball found at a local playground?  That ball is way to slick to palm.

 - Is this the picture that landed your hot wife?  It would land me and I don't even like dudes.

I mean just read Zach lowes article on Charlotte from earlier this year. He does a good job of explaining what they have and what they don't.

Specifically Batum, teams typically don't trade for players who are not as good and that cost more in the cap. I'm not sure the cap works with all the dudes you threw in from Charlotte if Batum is making more than boogie.`\Chi3f!!!`\No clue. We might go for Batum.`\Kobe didn't when he was surrounded by trash. `\This is one of the rare occasions that a Kings game isn't the biggest show in town`\Watch them win 29`\Too young... he needs to be 38 in ricks system.`\Kings offense is beauty`\While it's true someone could've still drafted Porzingis, it's possible that if Melo signed with the Lakers then they wouldn't have been as bad as they have been these past few seasons resulting in getting D'Angelo Russell. So If Russell is instead at the 3 spot you're telling the Knicks wouldn't have taking Russell?

They were keen on taking Mudiay before the draft until Phil said he wanted Porzingis.`\It's crazy how he can simultaneously be the most whiny, demonstrative player in the league about calls, while also being one of the two most reliant players on getting calls and going to the line. Dude shoots about the same amount of free throws as Harden while taking fewer shots. The amount of phantom calls he gets is staggering, yet whenever he doesn't get a call he's so mad that he can't play defense. `\Stream?

This city and this team deserve this arena. I think it's going to be great and help the city and the arena. It'll work so well for this city. `\I don't think you would have to worry about that really as a Spurs fan. The Spurs take in players who have good attitudes and such. Boogie is not the type of player that the Spurs want on their team. `\Mike Breen going off about Cousins lmao`\Nah this is just a sweet loop/reverse. Plus it has too many pixels.`\I was stoked when we signed him cause when you guys had him I thought of him as the best backup C. I definitely think otherwise now lol`\As fans, we dunno either. The Spurs just do their thing and it's like huh we have 50+ wins and 1 digit losses. `\Cousins and a 1st round pick for Whiteside and Dragic`\He sets himself up to fail.

�� confirmed.`\you wrong`\He could have used his normal account`\pls cavs i'm too young to have a heart attack`\Great timeout Byron`\I want to see a more aggressive/selfish D'Lo next game. When he's looking for his shot, we play so much better. When he's out there with Clarkson and Randle and D'Lo is running the point for the top, it's always a pass to Clarkson off a screen for a brick 3 or Randle doing Randle things and looking completely out of control doing it. `\I like Simmons + Randle over Boogie tbh.

If Simmons can learn to shoot hed be an excellent player at the 3 spot WITH Randle. `\Lol Boogie bodied Ryan.

You can tell he loves the game and wants to add more elements to his playing `\http://i.imgur.com//h0FptYC.gif`\West is stacked as hell it's a fact. Trading him to a western team means I risk the chance of facing him who I believe is the best offensive center since shaq every year after the rebuild works and we make the playoffs in 2019. He's leaving and there is no way anyone is going to give up a star for him plus I would be set on a quick rebuild with good young talent. `\Or because a lot of cavs fans stay off r/nba because all this sub does is shit on us.`\He'll have 2 more years left. The Kings shouldn't panic. Unless a team is willing to give something fair in return, I'd rather just lose him in FA. I'm not going to help a team like Boston build a dynasty around Cousins.

Cousins is a top 10 talent, if we can't at least get back a top 30 player...I'm keeping him. If the Kings can't get at least the first 2 picks in this draft, I'm keeping him. `\What current NBA player do you think has the most similar game to yours?`\Hey Peja,
First of all thanks for the great memories!
Second:
Who was the funniest guy on the Kings back in the day?
`\It happened not even a year ago, you act like it was 10 years ago. `\I'm fully enjoying this game. `\NOOOOO NOT RUDY GAY`\Who is the best player in the NBA and why is it Quincy Acy?`\It's going to happen tho smh. Sign KD outright, trade the nets pick and some assets for Cousins `\Not to be reactionary over small sample size but I hope you saw what boogie did to your beloved big guys twice in a few week span.

Malone knows him and if he is willing it wouldn't surprise me at all if they jumped in. Boogie is clearly better than what they have now, despite what you hear from Jokics r/NBA stans`\Yeah I agree but realistically even gettin to 30 is meaningless lol. `\seems like he fucked up`\Just a terrible free throw shooting night. `\LMAO`\He's actually shooting 46.3 FG% and 40.6 3PT%, and has our 4th best eFG%`\Evan Turner can pass`\haha Mario with the Kings hangout.`\It's not like we've been playing good teams since he dropped. It's been an incredibly forgiving schedule up to this point.`\at least we had fun this season, right guys?`\Just wanted to say you were the shit in NBA2K12. 3's all day. `\You guys should've worn your hardwood classic jerseys too`\13 YEARS

How dare he?`\Cleveland is falling apart at the wrong time. `\He was also in the East his entire career. Cousins, Love, Davis might not get the #1 seed like Lebron but I'm sure they could carry to a playoff spot in the East`\Sigh`\???scoops what is going on in your head fam.

how is cousins + 40 games of bledsoe + warren + booker going to actually be good? only if booker becomes a flat out superstar, in which case the suns will be good without cousins.`\trade boogie to the 6ers for okafor and their pick`\Because our team is a fucking wreck. Several of our recent games have seen players not even showing effort. Not even trying on defense. They've givien up on Karl. Although they did try against Knicks and won and the Bulls and were competitive.`\As a basketball fan I am honestly going to say that this year with all these injuries we don't deserve to be in the playoffs and would be better off settling to get that final lottery pick that we don't even have anymore because Donnie Nelson doesn't believe in picks.

As a Mav fan though, I say fuck the Rockets and we need to do everything in our power to leapfrog them and make our way into the Playoffs over them.`\They don't make players with shit attitudes good. They take players with good attitudes and make them good.`\lmao Utah`\Houston and Utah are both capable of losing a lot of games really fast, so yea...possible.  I'd prefer 8, though...`\I don't think cousins is worth passing on Simmons and Ingram. `\almost but AD dont get dunked on`\What happened? I missed this...`\I know K-Love struggled offensively, but he does have the best +/- on the Cavs tonight.`\Kinda hope Lakers don't do it unless D'lo/JC are not involved.`\what a great baseball pass by rudy`\Randy must truly fear for his employment `\I need a gif of Cuz's reaction to that WCS shot`\I could do without Boogie hitting 16 footers.`\#freewillie #leavetrilloutthere`\Ok and how is that his fault? Isn't he paid to ball? He's clearly balling out of his mind.  Shouldn't it be the coaches and management who should be  fixing the chemistry issues,  isn't that their jobs? `\I already feel sorry for whoever picks up cousins next year, unless it's the lakers.`\Fraizer is a fucking baller`\> Phil Jackson never becomes GM of the New York Knicks as he was going to come to Seattle and run the team as GM.

I had never heard this, and when I googled it I pretty much came across like 4 forum posts.

Also, a lot of this is just quite frankly, stupid as shit.`\Another Euro foul fail...I think Quin should have just left it in Europe.`\Kings gave up way too many possessions in the last 2 minutes. `\Fire coach. `\Holy shit hAHAHA`\for morale...`\You grab that rebound and I swear to God, OT was happening.`\Yeah Lol`\Cevape (pr: Che-VAH-pe). That's the shit right there.`\2 long 2s for Crabbe.

I played with Vlade who's obviously from the same country, that was a relief for me since I was coming from overseas and not able to speak very good English.

They said Malone needed to go, Thomas wasn't any good and we shouldn't keep him, were on Petes side throughout his entire time here when it was obvious he didn't have any clue about what he was doing, etc. they have no credibility when it comes to both the Kings, or the game of basketball.`\This is the type of stuff Rudy should be doing most games, he's certainly capable of it`\Draymond has 13, Boogie has 15.

There's plenty of evidence that the refs gave the lakers a ton of calls in game 6, where is the evidence of questionable calls in the kings favor? Free throw disparity could mean the kings were more aggressive throughout the series? `\I'm at work so I'll get some booing out of my system now `\Cousins, smh `\>fellow northern Californian

Do both sides agree?`\Firing Malone after only 24 games into a season they started 11-13 will be looked at as the beginning of the end of the Boogie-Kings era. This team only has to go 5-14 to win 30 games for the first time in Cousins' entire career, and I would put money on them failing to do so. And even if they do win 30 games, that is still such a pathetic accomplishment. Cousins shouldn't get a pass for shit like this, but I don't understand how people compare his situation to Davis' when the Pellies won 45 games just last year. I think he's definitely gone this summer, hopefully to a team with the situation you outlined

edit: phrasing`\13PTS IN 11MIN`\u better not be lying to me`\I've been saying this for quite a while on my string of accounts, but here it goes:

TRADE BOOGIE WHILE HIS VALUE IS HIGH. `\That's not a good defender then. You don't get to choose when you will and won't be a good defender. You either play good defense all the time to be considered a good defender or you don't and then you're a bad defender

Harden has shown good defense when he tried but he doesn't try all the time so he can't be considered a good defender. Same should apply to Boogie

Quit making excuses for him`\Holy shit Kawhi, that was great.`\We seriously can't defend anything`\I like Parsons as much as the next Mav  fan but they show that commercial way too fucking much `\We are still the Timberwolves. And we desperately need Rubio. `\Because ball is life`\GO KINGS WOO FUCK YEAH`\I actually hadn't thought of this... That could be really good!`\put in fucking mcgee or salah cmon carlisle`\aye Sacremento we'll give you the animated corpses of Taj Gibson and Joakim Noah, "3Kola" Mirotic, and a 1st rounder for Boogie.

^()^()^()^()^(pls say yes)`\Only thing to do`\I actually suggested something like this in a Cavs "if you a GM" thread

It's kinda shitty for Kings but the Cavs are retarded for playing the game with y'all know who. Maybe Lebron will recruit his friends over since he like the name of his new team`\that ronfo decision making`\Hi Peja, thanks for doing this AMA. Can I please volunteer as your Player Personnel & Development intern on the basketball court one day a week? I've rehabilitated an ACL and PCL reconstruction while polishing my jump shooting form and bio-mechanics, so I'm very familiar with developing as a player. `\That doesn't even make sense. Dude didn't want to play in the playoffs and behaved like a child. Now he's happy and playing well, how is that saying something about our team`\I get why LMA left Portland.

He was like, "im going to be the best blazer ever." and he probably would have been. For like two years until Lillard passed him, and he was like well fuck it whats the point then?
`\Bonner is on fire `\danny has a stud!`\10 points come on miraculous comeback time`\Would you rather have Wes or Batum back?`\If he is only feeling agitated and not demanding to be traded then I keep Cousins. After that I get the coach that can best design/run a system to play to his strengths and mesh with his personality.

I don't go chasing draft picks that may or may not be any good in the future when I think Cousins is more than fine to build around. He is part of the reason the team didn't win 30 games again, but one of the smallest parts when you line them all up. If a guy as talented as Cousins is willing to stay with Kings after the complete disaster the franchise has been his entire time in the NBA I hold onto him until he has had enough. `\All NBA big man > clueless owner



Cousins would be lucky to end up elsewhere at this point.`\Shocked to see AD just stand there and not slide over in help.`\Definitely worst game I've ever seen from DC`\This is smart. The quickest rebuild involves changing the institution by hiring a real GM and a real NBA head coach. Keep Cousins, keep WCS, and honestly keep Rondo if possible. Getting rid of Rudy should be a top priority this offseason. I would be on the phone with teams like the Bulls, Nets, Suns, or the Wizards trying to convince them into the Rudy Gay experience. We should probably come to terms with losing our draft pick, so we need to fill out a real bench for next year that can defend and take care of the basketball, and preferably shoot. Cousins is simply unstoppable on offense, and he should be THE focal point on offense. I don't see the sense of trading him`\We understand that he has attitude issues. I don't defend what he does, and he needs to learn to contain his behavioral problems.  With what being said, I can understand why he reacts the way he does because he's been in a dysfunctional organization his entire career.  Doesn't mean I agree with it or that he should do it, just the reasoning behind it.`\Some still have faith, but many people are starting to think he won't be brilliant. I think he's going to be serviceable in a M. Gortat kind of way. Not worth putting the hopes of a franchise in. `\Wheels up Flight 23!`\so did i miss something or has love not done anything productive tonight?`\Quick couple of questions if you don't mind:

How did it feel winning one with the Mavs back in 2011?

Also, how was Chris Paul, since you were teammates back in 2008-2009?`\He's not an ambiturner. `\True, we have a brutal schedule too, but i think i'll end up rooting against all of the East these last 11 games lol`\Open your wallet. Hire a coach. Work with him to decide if Boogie should be traded, answer is most likely yes. Rebuild properly over the next 4-5 years. Draft BPA, smart trades, invest in developing youth, instill winning culture (don't tank). Replace current contenders after their windows have closed.

Huge Webber fan from his fab five days so when he got to sac I became a kings fan too and never looked back. Definitely caused cognitive dissonance in the WCF.

You have a year and a half for the right trade to come before a trade has to be forced. Give him another year, try and put shooters and defense around him so they can spread the floor, you got WCS down low with him to pack the key but Karl doesn't play him.

Unless they deal Cousins for a package that brings back a point guard or a pick that turns into a point guard, there's really not a lot out on the free agent market that the Kings are going to be able to attract next summer.

Conversely, I don't think it's crazy to think you can't get him back on a similarly priced deal for say 3 years with a team option on the last year.  `\Well why do you think Karl wanted to trade him? Cousins has been an immature baby long before Karl.`\Actually she did a good job. Barely any fell. Way to save the beer! `\Temple seems to always hit his first 3`\Manu's bald spot, Timmy's Knee Brace, and Bonner's red hair. Those are the secrets to our power.`\NO way, the last thing we need is bad defensive ball stoping slow center. Honestly despite how much Asik sucks I'm not stressing about the center position. AD plays so much C we just need a fill in guy for 20-15 mins like Mahinmi. We need a legit sf and wing in the worst way.`\This is like a shitty version of the all-star game.`\how about his plus minus?`\you're welcome

Lol, I like them, but damn. `\that new FO would need to get new players as well, which is going to be hard seeing as the Kings already used all their draft assets to assemble this shitty team.`\I'd say it's time for us to tank, but we gave all of our picks to Philly, so even that isn't an option until like 2018.  SIGH.`\You see this team its a joke`\Considering hes 32 years old yourre probaly right.`\Cuz needs to fucking chill`\MEATBALLS NO!`\It's K-Love all over again.`\Harkless with the spin move dunk was nice. `\You gotta admit, some of the guys on this bench give us a decent positive note on a terrible season.

`\Holy shit Doug Christie!  Don't get fired!`\Kings getting away with some no-calls`\So we should blame it on the boogie?`\I'm commenting on it because I hadn't noticed the reply until now, and I don't appreciate the downvotes and replies telling me I am lying or wrong when they are just guessing that i am mistaken.  Did you read the Sac Bee that day too?
No?  Thenwhy in the world would you know different than I do?
I wasn't lying or hating, and I certainly didn't pick up the wrong paper.  They have excluded the Warriors, as well as other teams, multiple times in the year that I read their news paper, and the playoff game they left out was the most extreme example.  `\SF and PF were interchangeable back then tbh no matter the height, he moved well. Garnett used to play it too. `\Idk why no one our team just dunks the damn ball instead if rattling out lay ups, Lee gets the idea`\2-6 with 4 TOs.


Hell no he doesn't deserve to play. Just because he's a rookie doesn't mean we should let him play terribly for more minutes.`\I think he's taking about 30 wins not playoffs`\It was inappropriate, but calling it despicable is a huge overreaction. This kind of thing happens in sports sometimes. Draymond yelled at Kerr a few weeks ago.

I'm not saying it's okay (it's definitely not), but athletes are competitive and blow up sometimes. I have been in lockerrooms where players get in fights, players yell at coaches, coaches yell at eachother. Cousins is a hothead, but he's not a terrible person.`\So long Cole hahaha`\I know right? We suck so much. We've wasted so much potential here in OKC, killing our star player's careers.

Kinda funny getting the response from a Jazz fan, actually. ;)`\Lmao what just happened after that free throw???`\I don't think anyone is saying it just because Kobe said it. It's true. He gets techs for yelling but Draymond rarely ever goes on a tirade that hurts the team. He also doesnt take time off on the defensive end to complain to the refs.`\This is where Tim Frazier would have been running the offense and getting the bench guys good looks. `\man these free throws..... `\Its unbelievable that a player of his caliber still does this. I get that he is frustrated, but what does he think screaming a Karl will accomplish? `\The timeline which is just a shade lighter than the darkest one?`\The future looking so bright `\KLove with a team leading +19`\No doubt it's Houston. Reasonable people didn't expect the Wiz to be close to contending this year; 538.com predicted 41-41 and that might still happen. `\And people wondered why we didn't want to trade the number 2 pick, clarkson, and Randle for him last summer.`\I really truly hate this season and it's been awful... but they made the conference finals last year, that has to make theirs worse right?`\Fuck you refs! Don't call the call on us but call it on the kings. That's bullshit!`\Kosta isn't good though, atleast for us.  I've never seen a guy miss as many 3ft hooks as this guy.`\Manu has balls of steel. `\As long as we keep getting these ugly wins. It's a long shot, but we are still in 8th right now with the tiebreaker, a win over Washington would be huge though`\Maybe they shouldn't have fired the only guy that was capable of controlling him. What a complete joke of an organization, from the ownership, GM, Karl and the players, it's all a joke.`\Do you like hockey?`\With an old lady packing double D's, from the Virgin Islands, owning a chop shop.. and the tat's

Ya mon `\KC mothafuckin P
My man`\Best game I've ever watched. So thank you.`\Better i want a portland vs clippers first round`\Can't wait to hear the AAC boo the fuck out of Rondo`\It's worth mentioning that the SacBee has had a bone to pick with Cousins since forever.  This does not at all reflect the opinion of the city of Sacramento, just a minority of writers that despise Cousins.  The writers at the Sac Bee get leaks from the Pete D'Alessandro and Karl camp and at this point are basically just mouthpieces for them.

TL;DR The Sac Bee is 100% the worst source for Sacramento Kings news.`\He is, but we lost all morale watching him drop 30+ on a nightly basis and still lose because our defense is atrocious.`\Bosh might never play again, Wade might blow his knees for good, Whiteside might be gone this offseason, as might Deng`\Well, gg DET. If only the Kings could've shown more effort in the first half`\Keep Jrue, I'm in the minority but keep Tyreke he makes us much better^than^jrue but people claim "We're much better with him but we can't be great with him" which makes 0 fucking sense. Gordon should be selling his home because his day in NOLA are over.`\So its gonna be like that huh`\You don't need to be old to realize Boogie is immature`\I'm gonna employ the time honored technique employed in YouTube rebuilds:
Sign Larry Sanders and Ray Allen`\Collison has outplayed rondo by a long mile this year IMO`\I feel like this happens to some team every year. So this year, we just have to see who it happens to. We know it'll happen, so it might as well be against the team we wanna beat right?`\You guys can get a Kings haul for him if you decent to trade him. He's the best center in the league and a lot of people will blame his personality flaws on ownership woes. I hope you guys turn it around soon-- you guys were so much fun to watch and got so screwed over last decade.`\I was thinking more MKG at the 3, I'm not sure if Booker can play the 3 yet.`\oh my... As a Belgian I found that hilarious and sad at the same time.`\They won't have the same influence now, they have bad really bad for 3 straight seasons. Not to mention Kobe is leaving and there is no player on the Lakers roster who I see that could replace his leadership. I think they could get players through FA but I don't see them getting stars cheap anymore unless something changes IMO`\Purge.`\Isn't it important to grab a missed free throw too? I mean jeez, those are almost more important because usually you have already gave up 1 point. `\Nice try, Vlade.`\Man that team would be awesome. Goonsquad`\Hi, I go for the Kings.`\*damn kate*, back at it again with cartwheel!`\thats dumb. if we get 4th seed, we face GSW in second round after we whoop the clippers. `\It's strategically stupid to win any more games unless the Nuggets, Bucks and Magic all win a game as well. Finishing any better than any of them exposes the draft pick.`\LaVine can be so smooth at times.`\DE LA SOUL?! DJ Quake Killin it tonight`\I think most people struggle guarding Favors, that dude is a monster. Does Davis have a hard time guarding legit bigs?`\Do you prefer Peja or Predrag? Also do you like pizza? If so, what kind? `\Ok John, stop teasing, now is the time to break out and win the game.`\Huertas Rookie of year`\hahah yeah no doubt. But I do see them as chained events. Probability of each event goes up with success of the previous.  If LA wins the lottery, they become interesting. If they talk to KD's reps and get a sense he might come, they can try to work a deal for Boogie (should KD be interested in that path).

Odds are microscopic that this all happens, but actually it's probably nearly equal to the odds of just getting KD. So I might as well make the dream vivid, right?`\wtf, went to go make some food at the half, came back and we're down 3??? how!?`\sources say George Karl just unfollowed the Kings' official twitter account`\I can't remember the last time sacramento held onto a double digit lead `\LOL you know it's fluky when rondo drains a step back 3 though.`\I cringe every time Marco gets the ball`\Yeah, thanks though`\oh shit`\He's obviously in a situation he's not happy in. Id rather wait and see how he acts with a different FO before I call him immature. `\That's definitely part of it hahaha`\To the fucking Kings.......`\Put Clarkson, Randle, and D'Lo back in. They're the only reason any Laker fans are even watching these terrible games. `\Free Willie!

Him and Curry making plays together must be driving Karl nuts.`\10-15 years ago I ran into you in the Raley's in Granite Bay. I was too shy to say anything, but my mom insisted we say hi. You shook my hand and were an all around good guy. Thanks for being so cool, Peja. `\Yeah. His frustration is understandable but if he's gonna be The Man, he has to act the part. Throwing a tantrum at his head coach just isn't acceptable behavior. `\Not another OJ right?`\Idk that's so tough. On one hand you have the most talented front court duo ever, on the other a brewing shit storm of disappointment the likes of which you've never seen. I guess it could be worth it to bet on Cousins cleaning up his act but any team that gets him is playing with fire`\he plays within himself and I appreciate it. But dude could learn to shoot fts`\Go back even further and he played PG when he was 7 in the Bundesliga`\tough competition`\OTTO OOP`\Mobb Deep, Nas, and now some Funkadelic. I need this DJ at my next party haha.`\He has been criticized for his attitude since he was a rookie. Probably in college too. I don't see any other player of his caliber consistently having his attitude and maturity called into question for literally his entire career.

And he's had many instances over the years of unacceptable behavior.

He may be in a shitty situation with coaches that he may not like or feels that don't have his back, but that doesn't excuse his own behavior. He's had real issues since coming into the league, and there's no excuse for it.`\The refs did make the Lakers shoot 27 FTs or something like that in the 4th quarter`\31 and never airballed a freethrow in my life

Wtf does my age have to do with anything? Are you really defending airballing a FREE THROW and trying to attack me for thinking thats ridiculous? `\Dang Kawhi`\Casspi juked himself haha`\How's JJ not got a tech? `\Go Jazz. Kick our ass! \#TankToKeepOurPick`\That's the most excited we've ever been for a 15 point deficit`\What are the Jazz doing? `\Here comes Marco "All I do is pumpfake" Belinelli and Kosta "My hands are literally made out of bricks" Koufos`\Nah. I had my 7 year old with me. I have hung out with them in the past a couple times. A girl I know used to date their road manager. My life is 1000% less rock and roll since having a kid, but now I have another basketball junkie to hang out with all the time. `\I agree, but I think he really needs a coach that does it. We were absolutely retarded to decide to get Karl. Cousins needs somebody harsh like Thibs, JVG, or Malone to satisfy his id and let him vent in the course of working things out. With Karl, it's all subtext, coaching through the media, and reigning in through playing time. This was certainly not okay and he deserves every bit of the game suspension, but I think he could be a pretty great player with a coach that has a tough-guy mindset.`\Trying to rush everything.`\Boogie doesn't care for Ryno it seems. `\can't buy an effin jumper...`\Rondo sucks? lol well he just beat your team`\BANG`\I'd say the Kings should make a move on Dennis Schroder and whatever bigman is available in Philly (if Embiid is healthy, take a gamble on him. If not, go for Noel). Make a move for the future. Whatever they do with Cousins should be in separate deals. Don't trade for a bunch of future picks, trade for actual, semi-young talent and build from there, like the Blazers.`\You are 100% sure that Cousins wouldn't have these character issues at any other franchise? The guy hasn't just picked fights with coaches. He's picked fights with teammates, a trainer, and an announcer. I'd say it's 50/50 whether he can get his shit together on another team.  `\Shit, should have probably just gave that to him. `\He doesn't represent the rest of us.`\Roberts. You are not there to iso every paly.`\Zunox.hk usually has them`\At least Rondo actually suited up. `\I know Boogie has his issues and has a pretty checkered past but I can kind of see where he's coming from. I'm not saying it's the same, but I've worked for shitty companies. Companies with no direction, who make shitty hires, who are constantly making terrible decisions. It sucks. Now when things get too bad I know I can always just start looking for another job. I can't imagine working for that shitty company and having no other options. I guarantee if Boogie went to a decent organization he wouldn't have these issues.`\The Orlando trade is the real serious one. The Cavs and Portland one was a pipe dream since Mega Deals never happen really. Logic behind vonleh was weak I admit. Are you equally upset over Vucevic and Oladipo for him?`\Any new word on our new logo/uni design?`\"What impressed you about the wolves"

"the young guys"

Really? What did you expect, Prince to go off?`\How would you handle the Swaggy P - DLo situation or a similar conflict between players? `\FADE EM`\OJ!!!

Thats my dudeee`\wait what?
`\dont let dame play a minute in the 4th please`\tru, i miss our 06 green jerseys `\anyone else notice Willie looks a lot more ripped lately?`\Vuc and Oladipo for Cousins? Get real. We are asking for a superstar in return. Either Simmons or Ingram PLUS assets that Philly or Celtics give up like Embid/Okafor or Crowder/Bradley+Onylk. Otherwise, no deal because we still have Cousins for 2 more years. If we get our shit together by next year, Cousins will extend. He already said he loves it in Sacramento even though people don't consider it a great city or franchise. He also says that he would like to stay here till the end of his career. Cousins is known for speaking his mind. Always has always will. So it's not a PR move. Dude legit wants to be remembered as the best Kings player of all time. He just wants things to change with the team. Honestly, with Karl gone plus a few others like Belinelli and Gay who refuse to play defense plus another top 10 pick (hoping for luck) and a lots of cap space this off season we could really make a nice team.

I'd sign Ryan Anderson and Teletovic as our stretch 4's. We have plenty of bigs but no modern stretch 4s in the game that would play well with Koufos, WCS and Cousins which are our 3 centers. Now that we have that solved. We offload Gay+Belinelli for a season NBA vet plus a top 15 pick from this draft. They will work out at a different team not in our culture.
Re-sign Rondo but only for a reasonable price. Give Ben Mac his last year and last chance. Draft a SG/SF with our #7 and top 15 pick. Bam we have a great team. I'd even consider trading our two picks for a top 5 pick to get Murray.

Rondo
Murray
Casspi
Anderson
Cousins

Collison
Ben Mac
Vet
Teletovic
Koufos
Fillers like Anderson, Moreland, Curry maybe another vet or whatever. If we got rid of Gay and Belinelli that would be another 17 million of cap space plus the near 20 we would have going in. We could ideally sign Rondo and Anderson for 22 million which leaves us 15 million for another big signing but we would have to take a contract back for those two guys so it would be more like 7 million. I'd assume Teletovic might do another one year deal plus player option for 3 million. Which leaves us 4 million for an overpaid vet preferably a PF or SG. `\Manu still has that testicular fortitude`\If Boban ever figures out how to a decent PnR defense, he can be super good`\> Kings **release** they have suspended DeMarcus Cousins

Not a good way to deliver this news`\I thought most players not named Shaq respected Nash?`\Damn didn't know it was that bad. `\Klay Thompson accused of molesting little used guard Jorge Gutierrez as he drives to the hoop.`\> Let Rondo walk: Don't think he is going to do anything but hold franchise back.

why? isnt he playing really good this year?`\There was an ESPN insider article today that essentially said Town's stats are hollow and Jokic should win ROY based on a metric co-developed by the author of the article. Knocks on Towns like too many of his rebounds come on missed free throws.... blah blah blah...
`\Do I have access to gasoline and matches? `\Only 7 games back!`\By the way, I love you man. I'm serious not trying to be sarcastic or something. It's fun to debate this stuff, and sometimes more fun than actually watching the Knicks these days. =)`\Of course they don't call it`\And Anderson`\Your boy in your flair doesn't exactly help. He's supposed to be the primary scorer when Boogie is out, so of course he scores 8 points on 3/10 shooting.

Fine with me of course. I'm 100% in favor of Rudy leading the tank to close out the season.`\RoLo beasting. Him and KP are so good defensively, without them our trash guards would be completely exposed. Calderon, Vujacic and Afflalo. That must be a historically bad defensive starting trio...`\Red mamba!!! Sssssssssssss `\How are we only 5 points down?`\Tyreke is a great individual player but he doesn't really fit with Gentry's system. I like him but I won't be too upset to see him go at some point. Jrue is staying, period. `\filthy strength`\Cousins, you an open face sandwich, bro`\MY GOD WEST IS HYPE.`\....Boogie isn't going to get a 30 win season, is he?`\That's the "don't bring up cancer, bro" look`\Biggest joke of a franchise in professional sports.`\Sorry I just copy/pasted a post I made about this a couple days ago in /r/Kings.`\im a knicks fan, he has caused me much pain over the years`\2016 Kobe`\Maybe Draymond is only super motivated because his team is about to beat Jordan's record? Success is an incredible motivator, and lack of it is a legitimate excuse as to why some stars have such a lack of motivation.

Not everyone is a leader. Not every superstar can unite a locker room if it is failing. `\I agree, I would add AD to your list and probably Towns though. Maybe PG too.`\And he has 2 less techs than Boogie. `\I'd redo the deal if we land a top 2 pick this year, something along the lines of Randle, Clarkson, and Ingram for Cousins.

That could give Sacramento a young core of Clarkson, Hield, Ingram, Randle, and WCS.`\Chris Anderson has been a dope dope pickup on the defensive end. I liked him guarding Boogie in the fourth. `\I feel like the Mavs could easily be winning right now if they didn't try to shoot a 3 every possession and just take the 2 that they have...`\he has good skills`\Lmao NBA basketball ladies and gentlemen! `\what's the tim duncan dirt?`\they were due for a win`\This team is slowly making be an alcoholic... `\Kings getting dominated so far. No boogie is disaster for them. `\I miss when Dudz was milky from 3`\Go big or go home`\Sacramento strikes me as a good music city.
`\I am officially starting the engine for a trade-his-ass locomotive. Cousins has a bad attitude and he's not a winner. Trade him to the Celtics(trade rape them for Amir, Jae, Bradley and picks) or to LA(for Randle and picks and $$) and proceed with Rondo, Gay, Koufos, Collison, Cassipi, and the bunch and wait a chance to draft a star with the copious picks you receive, or trade for a Brook Lopez. And fire Karl and move the fuck on. `\Any ideas for who you would want to replace him?`\haha touche...

At the time, it didn't look like an overpay all things considered. Getting Nash and Dwight led to major expectations. I'm not saying Lakers trades always work out, but if you look at what they give up, it almost always seems one-sided.

I know people disagree and downvoted the hell outta my take, but guys force their way to LA all the time. It's entirely possible Boogie back-channels his way to LA, even if other teams could offer more. It's always happened that way. Dwight, Pau, Chris Paul (before veto), Glen Rice back in the day, Kobe at the draft, the picks that got them Magic and Worthy. I mean, seriously, you'd think they had ties to the mafia for all the leverage they've had in the last 30+ years.`\I...rant about this during late night League Pass Specials all season long

Can't put up these stellar numbers, keep losing, and act this crybaby way, expecting to turn an *entire  organization* around. Nothing has changed in  Sacramento, from the slivers of glimmers of early season hope, to the disappointing lack of success that comes down the stretch, to the front office + coaching turnaround and turmoil.  Nothing changes but Boogie's numbers--which seem to be improving with little *team* impact.

Blow it up.  Trade him away for pieces and/or picks. Start over. If Boogie flourishes elsewhere, so be it.  Perhaps attribute it to better coaching.  I'd rather see a team of smaller names go for the records they've been putting up season in and season out in the Boogie era`\Hello Peja!

But fucking rondo's behavior (minus the ref slur incident) has been so much more mature than DMC's, and he is someone who has won a championship and has even more reason to be pissed on the kings.

I'm hoping the Cavs get riled up from the disappointing loss last game, I think they'll come out with some good energy.`\This triangle offense is fucking trash. You have a dude who is 7'3", built like a stick and can shoot. The fuck you want him in the post throwing up bricks. Just put him in the pick and roll/pop a million times.

We can barely score against one of the worst defensive teams in the league.`\If Love can't hit his 3's we are essentially playing three separate power forwards.

`\Did the math for /r/Kings. We are mathematically out with any loss or any two teams between Utah, Dallas and Houston picking up a win. Playoffs are out of reach without highly improbable things happening over 7 games.

We lose the pick to the Bulls if we drop out of the Top 10 in the lottery. Currently hold the 7th worst record. Knicks have 30 wins, Bucks have 31, Magic have 31, Nuggets have 32. All either already eliminated or might as  well be in the case of Denver, with 3 teams at 37 wins fighting for the last 2  spots.

Assuming worse records continue tanking, we are OK beating one of these teams in final standings, as it still locks us in at no worse than a Top 10. However beating two of them, we have a 0.04% chance of slipping out. Three teams, it becomes 9.1%. Beating all four teams in the standings would all but secure giving the pick to Chicago, with a 97.1% chance of getting the 11th pick or worse at that point.

Sixers hold the pick swap, but seeing as they're a Top 4 guaranteed, that's far less consequential.

Strategically, the Kings should just pack up shop now to secure the draft pick this year.`\West still go it!`\The Celtics have 8 picks in this draft. We can seriously give the Kings a future. `\The worst defensive scheme in the NBA by far.  And it's gotten worse as the season has progressed.`\Koufos did something good!

Those packages are almost certain to be dissimilar enough that picking the 'best' one is going to be a much better strategy than arbitrarily cutting your trade pool in half because you're hedging against the unlikely eventuality that your franchise, which hasn't made the playoffs since 2006, will meet the franchise which acquires your star player (who has *never* made the playoffs), in the playoffs.

Besides, if the trade is a good one, you'll be taking a huge amount of talent *away* from another Western Conference team.  And if it's an awful one, Sacramento will be one of the worst teams in the league for the foreseeable future and all these considerations will be moot.`\https://m.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/3b18e2/price_being_discussed_for_cousins_is_the_no_2/`\Ayy GSG!`\He didn't say you weren't`\So frustrating.`\Rene was out of his element.`\Lol no reason Nick should be sitting out.`\Cate has to win the dunk contest. `\Who are some of your favorite teammates, both from the Kings and from different teams?`\This game is fucking ugly.`\yup`\CARTWHEEL SLAM!!!`\These refs are fuckin dumb.

Firing Malone and trying to rebuilt the roster rather than let things grow naturally was a huge mistake. Killed the team when they had a good thing going.

At this point I'd trade anything I can get positive assets for though, outside of WCS. Boogie needs a new home, not just for a better relationship with management, but so that he has a shot at making real use of his enormous talents and getting into the playoffs.`\Dafuq just happened? `\You can blame him for shit, and this was obviously excessive and warrants a suspension, but that isn't the reason why his teams suck. His teams suck because his teams suck. Yeah you have a couple good guys like Rondo and Rudy Gay on that team, but the Kings have never built a TEAM around him. He's definitely gonna have the Melo problem, where he's a really good player but not good enough to be on the same level as the greats like LeBron, Kobe, MJ, etc. and you'll have to put more talent around him to make up for that, but I don't think the front office realizes how much talent needs to be put around him, and how to put that talent around him coupled with a fantastic coach and a in a smart way. Melo has had that problem his whole career, and you saw what happened when he had a lot of talent around him a couple years ago, and that time he went to the WCF`\Lol no fucking supports in that low of mmr.

If Valanciunas was a good player, wouldn't the Raptors have a reason to include him in deals precisely because they consider him a piece other teams would value?

Are you suggesting teams only trade players they think are bad?

There are untradable players and then there are players with no trade value, but there are certainly players a long the spectrum in between. JVal is definitely above average in this respect, being a 23 year old center with a lot of experience and a decent midrange game. He's a great piece for a lot of teams in the modern NBA.`\The Kings would win a lot more games with Draymond.  He does not do stupid shit that cause his team games.  Boogie not so much.

So it's looking really good that at the end of this season, Philly has a '19 Kings unprotected 1st in their pocket. `\Matchups`\Wtf?

No one else in the Kings organization wanted him traded. Obviously other teams would trade for him?`\Bad team building. No player can alone push a team to the playoffs `\Go Kings go!`\I think I remember one instance of him going at it with it Cal. For the most part it was under control in college though.

Chemistry is always the common issue when you have new people coming to the team, especially if they are all-stars.

Oh, and we might need a better coach as well. If you think Russell vs Byron Scott was unbearable, it'll be a nightmare if we have Boogie instead of Russell.`\Good grief, so sloppy. GET IT TOGETHER.`\Haha he caught himself well there`\Rice: "Curry. . . more like . . .STEPH Curry tonight!"

I'm not saying trading for those guys is a bad plan. He asked why not so I gave him a pretty good reason. I think either option is very interesting for the lakers. `\Our management is trash, yes. But at the same time, Demarcus has had immaturity issues with every coach we've had, including Malone. I'm tired of people saying that we need to do shit to cater to him while he continues to act like a toddler on the court. I think he needs a change of scenery. It sucks, because he's such a beast, but with him as the leader of our team we aren't going anywhere.`\I think it's just the fact that he's a top-level player on a team that was perennially good enough to be in the playoffs, but not quite good enough to take that next step and really compete for a championship. Now that may not have actually been the case seeing what the Blazers are doing right now, especially with the emergence of McCollum, but I can see why Aldridge would have felt it was necessary to move to real legit contender.`\I have to think the Celtics with their stash of picks and players would be at the top of that list..Orlando possibly `\"You need to guard their ass!  What the hell are they doing?"  and then as they went to break, he literally yelled out, "DAMN!!!"  and not in the usual DC trying to be funny way.  He was seriously heated.`\Any player should get respected when he gets fouled like that, that was BS`\Collison continues to step it up.  He's been so valuable as a scorer recently.`\Nice win`\The Stepien rule is forward looking. Think of it this way. Any traded pick (even those with protection) is considered owned by the team it was traded to.

So Chicago owns the Kings pick this year. Unless - the Kings stay in the top 10 after the lottery is done. If that's the case, the Kings now owe Chicago a 2017 1st. The Stepien rule then insists Sacramento cannot convey the 2018 top ten protected 1st to Philly and that's even if the Kings end up not conveying their first to Chicago in 2017 either.

Long story short - if Kings keep their pick this year, they automatically owe Philly the '19 first unprotected. `\Only 1 move is needed. Sign Sacre! 30 celebrations/20 dances a game will bring any team a title.`\i want to see a nice game but this is just disappointing...`\Karl is currently a lame duck.

Especially on a losing team with a bad attitude.`\broooo i almost forgot how much of the goat bonner was`\we really could use a 30 point "rest the starters in the 4th" type of situation with a hard, but winnable, game tomorrow`\This actually made me laugh out loud, good job`\I can't say what defender, I can say a team. I always had trouble scoring against San Antonio. They always found a way to take the easy things away, so we had to work a bit extra just in order to take the shot. Bruce Bowen on those teams, he was a very focused defender. `\McDermott playing that whoever offense. `\That was a nice half`\Sacramento may very well get Ben Simmons in the draft. We always forget that teams can leap frog in the draft.`\God damn what a start`\Love hearing grant and jerry criticize the gold jerseys `\Sell high? No one is going to give us any high value for Cousins. You might say Boston, but that Nets pick is going in the 3-5 range.. you're looking at Dragen Bender, Jaylen Brown, Kris Dunn, Jamaal Murray, and Buddy Hield. Bender is raw and will not come over for at least 2-3 years. Brown has a high ceiling, but the Kings have proven that they can't develop talent. Dunn is already 22, and he's not a franchise player. Murray is one of the youngest players, but his ceiling isn't as high as the other guys I've already named. Hield is already 22, and he has potential to be James Harden 2.0...or just an average SG who struggles on defense.

I just don't see any package that would be selling "high" for Cousins. Selling high would be getting another star in return. Cousins has top 5 NBA talent and he's arguably a top 10 player. The Kings probably wouldn't even get back a top 30 player for him.
`\I wonder if his mom has an opinion on playing time?`\Strong drive Chief!!!`\Because Karl knew the FO wanted a run and gun offense(which was a reason Malone was fired) and Karl was also accustomed to that style in Denver and was slightly successful with it year in year out. Everyone knows Cousins doesn't hustle back on D, and spends a lot of time arguing instead of even jogging back on D. Karl knew it and gave it a try to "better" the team in the win column.`\Lol fuck it just Tarik, tired of Roy`\Lmao Boogie you ain't Rondo`\Well put.`\Well that was a mess`\Marcelo bout to get a triple double`\Except KG's Wolves made the playoffs several times, were even the #1 seed in 2004.

> Also with no Phil Jackson does Carmelo re-sign with the Knicks in 2014? Possible Melo to the Bulls/Lakers situation? If he goes to the Lakers does that mean they can acquire another superstar free agent? Do the Lakers go back to becoming a yearly playoff contender? Would Kobe still retire in 2016? Does LeBron still go to Cleveland seeing as his buddy Carmelo chooses the Lakers? Does Lebron go to the Lakers and team up with Melo and Kobe? Also since the Lakers probably won't suck does that mean D'Angelo Russell ends up somewhere else?

> Steve Kerr was supposed to become the Head Coach of the Seattle Supersonics had the Kings moved to Seattle.

Andre Miller, Terry Stotts, Nate McMillan. Guys who work hard, and have a good head on their shoulders tend to like KArl. Hot heads and adults that act like kids do not. `\It's ok because it was nothing.`\10 straight losing seasons locked in.`\( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) `\Why is Cousins getting all the blame? Everyone knew this would be a disaster when they signed George Karl. None of the players respect him and it reflects in their night-to-night effort, especially on defense. At least Cousins goes out and plays his ass off every night, something that can't be said for any other King.

If you paired DMC and Rondo with another legit scorer and some role players who can play any semblance of respectable wing defense then yes, they can win. With McLemore, Bellineli, Gay, Collison, and Casspi? No they can't win. `\Yeah. No thanks. I want a team that I have some connect to.

Best move. `\"Yo know we gotta win one for the Sac." `\So, you'd say he has "poor emotional control"? That really just sounds like you found a euphemism for "immature". He acts like a child. He has poor judgement. He whines when he doesn't get his way. He whines to GET his way. He hurts his team by constantly whining instead of getting back on D. He shows no respect for his coach, or, by proxy, his teammates. He's a giant walking turd of immaturity.`\Let's steal this one`\What's the LEAST you would be happy getting back for him?

On the one hand, I think plenty of teams would take a shot on him. On the other, I wonder if Kings get low-balled and have to settle or do nothing.

Celts would probably give up picks and Smart or Crowder, but maybe not both.

Lakers would do Randle and Clarkson or 3rd pick, but not Russell or 1st or 2nd (if they get one of those).

Den probably throws you Jokic and maybe a protected first.

Orl something like Dipo and Vuc. `\BUTLER HERE TO SERVE YOU`\This is true, and a Jazz fan should know that haha. I do think we can win one, but you pretty much have to have all the stars align in your favor even with great players`\Hehe did RoLo and KP just hug :)`\Do you know Tim, like, at all? That's the complete opposite of his personality lol. He's a huge nerd bruh`\If he ever gets to a winning and stable organization, I think he will conform for the sake of winning. Getting a bunch of tech's isn't the biggest of deals (Draymond already has a ton, I think he's 2nd to Boogie) as long as his play backs up anything he says.

I also doubt the Kings just 'get rid' of cousins. He's got 2 years left on his deal (which is a steal at his production), and they're moving into a new stadium. They will ask for all of a team's assets to move cousins, and at that point, I find it highly unlikely teams like the Celtics or Lakers move their young talent AND draft picks for Boogie.`\Dude you guys suck too `\damn, manu and kawhi filling in well for the boys resting.`\Gentry system is a good premise, but his rotations and adjusting his system to a roster is horrible. Ryan and AD play most of their minutes together but we won't keep him. He's not worth the money, he's too big of a defensive liability, and too streaky. AD has played more 5 than 4 this year and I see him going on the KG/Bosh career path of playing those positions. `\So fking happy for Kevin!`\RIGHT NOW!@!!`\What's with all the nonexistent comments?`\Please run a play.. `\hes getting good looks and attacking, just not dropping tonight and not getting some calls he would like. Also, Gay is playing him really well. I'm sure he will turn it around in the second half.`\That haircut Rachel :/`\My mind is blown. I've had alien blue for years and never knew this was a thing. Mobile NFL/NBA comment sections just got much better. `\Yeah, Jamychal Green still balling.

Jk, but it's good to see Conley have a clutch, efficient game again. We've been leaning pretty heavily on Zbo for a while now.`\They couldn't fucking miss.
`\pretty sure all those guys won games. if you are such a headcase and have yet to break 30 wins a season shit doesnt add up`\Now you all know why the Kings are known for only playing 3 quarters a night.`\Yeah man, he's got the looks for this league`\nO FUCKING WAY LOL`\Noice`\I think a lot of fans are ready for him to move on too`\I just want a coach for a little while. Idk. Being a fan of this team is tiring.
`\But we're up in win pct so technically we're 8 seed`\omg Dante that was so badass`\not dirks, i can tell you that lol`\Tony Parker's new single: "This is the moment. Tissot."`\That's the Koufos we know... :(`\by the time randy puts him back in it'll be faaaar too late`\Everyone on the Suns that played tonight besides Booker can GTFO.

Maybe Alan Williams can stay, but that's it. `\That happened 10 years ago`\Because Rondo can steal the ball from Dirk pretty easily.`\Shaqtin`\Kobe's on that list too. MJ, Kobe, Manu.. and I dunno lemme think about two others.. `\People here only look and see "lol 4th Seed Portland" when they see that team.

But they had the right pieces in place.  They met the 40-20 rule and were top 3 offense when healthy and top 5 defense when healthy.  Just needed some depth, which they would've been able to add in the past free agency period and the next.

And just need Lillard to hit his prime like Curry has.  I mean, it's not like the Warriors were all that before Curry hit his prime.  Otherwise, both teams were also dealing with injury related issues that truly hindered the team from reaching their full potentials.`\I saw a Kings fan suggesting JV, Bruno and the NYK/DEN pick`\Ever seen Jeremy Lamb play?`\Danny Ainge would trade the Brooklyn pick for Cousins in a heartbeat.

So, not snitching? Got it`\Perfect.`\wow fucking early oubre! `\Seriously? Phil literally admitted on the Dan Patrick Show that he had a job lined up with a potential team in Seattle. It wasn't specified, but it was widely assumed it would be GM. Only if the team went to Seattle. When the Kings didn't move, he looked elsewhere.`\Rondo is an unreal passer`\Honestly I doubt it, the last stretch includes Spurs twice, GSW twice, Cleveland, and the Hawks. All games I expect to lose`\Payne is.. an exception.`\Hey at least you have Willie Trill. He's a Kentucky big man and they're on the up and up if you saw that other post!

Nah but really I think you guys can get it going some time soon. I'm hopeful for you all`\Ricky down!`\Mills with a potential dagger. `\Thanks for the insight.

Wish me luck, I am off tomorrow and it might snow....time to watch some Kings games.

`\Pedja, do you ever spell your name correctly any more?`\Looks pretty bright to me. We can get darker.`\sometimes I wonder if Karl is just sleeping with his eyes open during games`\10 point lead again. Pop had to rail them in the locker room`\Which one of these tumors are more malignant:  DMC or Dwight?`\Ignore my last comment`\Sheeiiit, he did the Dirk on Dirk`\I dunno.  I think there's some spooky weird shit going on in Sactown.  I don't think that we can trust anything about that FO's goals.

I'd like to have Boogie, but keeping JC and D'Lo together is priority IMO`\Be realistic everyone. The Kings do not have to trade him. He is under contract for another two seasons I believe. The Timberwolves got Wiggins, Bennett, and ThadYoung for Kevin Love. That is two consecutive #1 picks overall for Kevin Love.

Plus if we could give up the pick, Clarkson, and Randle and get to KEEP Russell then I do this trade in a heartbeat. `\This is my favorite`\shut the fuck up bandwaggong bitch. We know your not from cleveland`\AHHHHHHH 4 POINTS WE CAN DO THSI!`\These refs are way too fucking tech happy, looks like he got all ball too`\lol anyone watching on league pass, seemed like boogie was cursing out george karl in one of the timeouts. George Karl just had a disappointed dad face.
`\What he did was unacceptable. He needs to learn that he's first a *professional*, and then that passion is what makes *professionals* go above and beyond.`\LaVine is so bad `\Ridiculous`\Yeah, I think he takes away opportunities for Huertas to create. I think Lou is ok and I wouldn't shit on him completely. `\A former player respecting Steve Nash. What a time to be alive.`\Holy shit anyone watching this 12 year old kid shred? `\Joined the nba this year huh ?`\No matter how crappy the Kings are as an organization, a Demarcus Cousins team still hasn't gotten over something like 30 wins, right?

That's terrible. He is obviously a special talent, but there are three main problems with him:

1) He forces way too many poor shots (his career FG% is among the worst for active centers)

2) He is turnover prone

3) He has a serious personality and mood problem which leads to a lot of fouls, techs, and problems with coaches

However talented he is and whatever flashes he has shown, he hasn't shown he can translate it to winning.`\For us people who aren't neccessarily Kings fans, but love watching your team (the Vlade/Webber/Jwill team got me into the NBA), you guys are anything if not entertaining`\Everything is delicious. I'm sure you're going to have a good time! The city of Belgrade in Serbia has been voted the #1 entertaining city in Europe, so I'm sure you'll have a good time. `\FUCK`\Umm. The stats says that they 107.1, third to GSW and Spurs. First in assists and top ten in rebounds and steals.

Sure you want to stick with that assessment? (Haven't seen enough of their games, so just going by stats)`\i teared up a little seeing them crowd around him and pump him up after that`\Holy shit. Checking in now`\So sexy. https://vine.co/v/iDOTMUbtOxu`\Jrue, shot it too early with 10 seconds on the shot clock and 15 seconds on the game clock.  Oh, but he made it so it's forgiven.`\Kevin Love is BOOTY holy fuck `\I don't think he did, he said there wasn't much there.`\nice first half. lets see that cavs don't get reinvigorated and kings keep it up`\Plan to win 3 years down the road honestly.

I'd blow the team up ala 76ers.

Cousins goes to team X (pref a win now team that's aging and has one last hoorah) for 2018 1st and their 2019 1st, also a third team is involved and I get their 2019 1st.  I also take any salaries needed to make this go through.

Rudy Gay is traded in the same style 2018 and 2019 1sts.

Draft european players this year that have more of a high risk/reward factor, no "safe picks".

The big idea is that in the 2018/2019 draft you'd hope that you either can get 1 superstar, and 1 very high quality player. Hope that you now have the cap room to maneuver in FA and pick up a big name to go with them.

`\Sully and Willie would be a very compelling front line. I think they would demand this year's Brooklyn pick though
`\fucking kcp

love that kid so much

shame on everyone raggin' on his terrible games`\both free throws missed but the second one resulted with a loose ball and scramble that ended in collisons hands and killing 6 seconds off the clock`\Draymond and Klay slipped Boogie a joint before the game`\Could have*`\Debatable whether Dlo is or isnt a head case. You should see his courtside celebrations!`\we pray that wall asks for a trade so he could be happy`\Cousins has not got any foul calls these past couple games`\**ENHANCE**`\What was Watson's plan making him a featured offensive player?

Thanks, Injury Gods.`\the kings will be playing in a new stadium from now on
`\Sounds like excuses to me man. Especially when so many seasons have been injury plagued. At a certain point you've gotta look at your training staff and question the investment in so many injury prone players. `\how in depth do you think I can go with what you said? That's ridiculous. For all that, I can say Noel plus Okafor plus the la pick should get us any player outside the top 5. But I wouldn't say that because it's fucking stupid`\What are the most likely trade scenarios for Cousins in the offseason? Any guesses?`\Thank you. I don't get why people keep making excuses for Boogie. Obviously the situation is shitty but you don't see someone like AD yelling at teammates.`\Meh, you're still the Lakers. You would have a legit superstar and some young talent to work with, plus all of that cap space. I'm sure you wouldn't have much trouble bringing in some free agents to fill out the roster. `\rudy dont give a fuck`\why would he be called "mini curry"`\My only fear is boogie going full markief and ruining the opening of the new building. I mean I wouldn't take a 2nd round pick for him, but if I could get two young promising players, or Ben Simmons or Jabari or Giannis or someone of that ilk, I'd have to consider that even if the offer isn't blowing anyone away.

I just don't see Boogie moving on mentally until he moves on. Hope I'm wrong or it gets resolved in the summer for Boogies sake.`\Are you referring to the constant change in camera angle and quality?`\I hear you dude sorry for misinterpreting your earlier comment.

>! I like to deal in evidence and I don't see anything that supports your take except your own opinion and wild speculation.

well, Charlotte was in talks with Houston to land Dwight Howard at the trade deadline, so I didn't find it that out of speculation to conceive that they'd also be interested in Demarcus Cousins `\Inside the NBA gonna be lit af tonight`\Convince Ranadive to sell the team`\Huertas is a better passer and has more experience but Russell is a better shooter by far considering Huertas rarely shoots.



`\Its funny that Duncan gets way more superstar calls than him. Its not even close. `\And it's not just bad talent they've surrounded him with but poor fit. A big man needs some shooters to give him some space to work down low. Who can shoot on sac? `\he mostly just struggles late in the shot clock, but that's not unique to him, even on the Jazz.`\I love Acy so much. This kind of hustle is what I want every night. Ball movement too.`\Is it too much to ask to put Manu in for the last two minutes Pop?`\omg Butler went in at the end not bonner. We got the cut wrong confirmed??!!`\So? I'm just predicting who they'll ask for in return. They'll probably want LA's pick too, if Philly doesn't get it. `\If we still had Thibs I would say yes. Hoiberg already has a bad ticker, I don't know if he wants any part of the drama and baggage that comes with DMC. Thibs would put DMC right in his place and if I'm the Kings and want to salvage this, I pay Thibs whatever he wants to be the coach of the Kings next year, he already has championship history with Rondo and has coached Cousins with team USA`\Felton has really grown on me this season `\Game now. Dallas had to get that rebound.`\hmm id say its like 50/50`\Kings had less fouls called on them and shot more free throws for the series.

13 less fouls called against the Kings. 19 more free throws. And yet everyone still bitches about the series being rigged by Donaghy who didn't even ref a game in the series.

Game 3 had a bigger FT discrepancy than Game 6, but seemingly everyone in the sub was born sometime after Game 5 and only has memories of Game 6.

I don't know what I would do with my jersey but I'm really sick of all this shit and I just want almost an entirely new team. I'd keep Casspi, Acy, Cauley-Stein, Collison (one of my favorite backup pgs in the league), and maybe keep Rondo since he's been doing well. Rudy is way too inconsistent, McLemore hasn't developed into what he should have, Belinelli just downright sucks, and Boogie is just a fucking emotional asset that, despite being an incredibly good player and all-star, always seems to find a way to drag this team down. The year of the monkey isn't racist, Boogie.`\So...hey. `\They were a 4-5 seed last year even with Aldridge with torn hand ligaments, Batum with an injured wrist, Lopez with a broken hand, Lillard with a fucked up shooting hand, Dorell Wright with a broken hand (everyone hurt their hand), Wes out for the season, CJ/Crabbe not playing, and Afflalo sucking.

They were 2nd in the stacked West when everyone was healthy. Multiple writers (including Lowe) said they were a darkhorse championship contender. And that was before CJ and Crabbe broke out. So you are basically adding 4/5ths of our current starting lineup AND 2 of our best bench players to that #2 team (CJ, Vonleh, Plums, Crabbe, Hendo). And Lillard has taken another huge step forward.

So yes, I do think they would be better than both OKC and the Cavs. Especially the Cavs, who have Lebron, but the Blazers would likely be better at every other position. `\[Peja's numbers vs Bruce Bowen.](http://www.basketball-reference.com/play-index/h2h_finder.cgi?request=1&p1=stojape01&p2=bowenbr01)

Why do we have owners exactly? `\All hail the fiddler`\To be fair, he's been garbage this game. That shot was huge though.`\They'd be terrible, but it's probably the right thing to do. They're just not going to right the ship in time to convince Boogie it's worth staying through another contract.`\He'll be a good three and D guy in this league. Plays agressive defense which leads to steals, but also stupid fouls. Needs to become a consistent shooter.  `\Should have said *almost*. The Suns' pick this year, so long as they're not jumped by Brooklyn, has a 96% chance at being in the top 5.

Even if we move down to 4th best odds it's 82.8%. `\oh my god, this is beautiful`\Suddenly the Kings are making easy point on the board .`\Also, Philly fans/media would be tough for Boogie to deal with I think. `\Tarik still can't keep himself from handing out fouls all over on both ends..`\Rick and Morty?`\It was good in former Yugoslavia before the country split in '91.

I don't think Rondo is the right guy for this team, and we still have major needs at SG, as well as at SF/PF.

I would be ok with giving it a shot with Boogie and Thibs, simply because Boogie is such a great talent and Thibs is still such a great coach. That would still require a roster overhaul, though, which could potentially be made a bit easier by bringing in Thibs.`\i know exactly who you're talking about and i'm not watching the game. `\Our ability to keep teams in the game is something to marvel at.`\Didn't they almost get moved due to lack of monetary support?`\Here's the link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=76wOnjOOtP8`\let him be. he's prob chugging straight from the bottle like most of us kings fans.`\Seth Curry is a real nice defender`\Do the Kings not know what the fuck help defense is?!?!?`\soooo what did lue do exactly..?`\I just needed him to get me 10 fantasy points to go to the finals. Worst stream ever lol. `\We need Reddick for the all white Barea/Reddick/Parson/Dirk/Lee lineup`\Because coaches ask their players to play as a team and that means sacrificing. WCS can supposedly shoot threes (in practice) but they hasn't translated to the NBA. Towns did, but it's probably rare for that stuff to really work right? Like dudes with playground dribble moves don't use them often for the same reasons `\Boogie not playing is a huge relief for your big men haha.`\He's great. Went to Notre Dame, set the NCAA record for most points in a game during the NCAA Tournament, 61, which still stands today. Played on the Cavs back in the Richfield days, is known as Mr. Cavalier. He gets really into the game, and is a big homer, so a lot of fans for other teams absolutely hate him, but I think he's great. It's like listening to a game called by an old uncle sitting on the couch after a couple beers. `\Basketball isn't the only sport I watch. I became an arrogant prick through watching the A's and Raiders of old.

Losers always tell winners how to feel. `\I'm saying when I was a young kid I had anger problems but as I got older I learned how to handle myself and control my emotions. Boogie is 25 years old and throws temper tantrums like he's 12 and he's been doing this shit for who knows how long. You think after awhile he'd figure out he should probably start handling himself in a different manner, guess not.`\sacto broadcast:

huh?`\Youre trying and failing to attack me personally because i think airballing a freethrow is ridiculous

hilarious

`\He's not the best finisher as it is, when he's going a million miles an hour and has very little control its so frustrating to watch. Also, what's up with him standing at the top of the 3point arc and catching the ball? This happens 9-10 times a game AT MINIMUM and all he does is hold the ball or tunnel to the hoop... he's useless catching the ball out there since he won't shoot it. If he's going to have his several possessions a game where he tries to just bulldoze his way to the basket, then at the very least Byron/Coaching Staff needs to put him in an optimal position to score the ball. I hate the stalling that he does at the top of the arc... I don't think I've seen anything good ever come of it`\Ownership couldn't be any worse than the current ownership.`\I mean, they still suck I don't know what OP is going on about `\I LOVE KARL-ANTHONY TOWNS`\That's not good news `\Celts would probably give them this year's Nets pick plus other assets. Assuming that's a top 5 pick, plus their own top 8 pick, you just go full rebuild.  Yes, the sixers get to proxy tank through you next season via the pick swap, but they'll be awful too so it's not a huge loss.

Hire a new coach.  Pay top dollar to build the best analytics team in the NBA.  Hire a scout to live in Europe and find guys that are under the radar and can contribute right away.

`\I'm just saying, there are certainly outside factors that aren't helping.

Welcome to Kings Basketball my friend.  `\You're a homo`\Lakers fan here. I gotta say, you guys were the better team. Sure, maybe you guys didnt execute like you should have, but i think the refs really gave it to the lakers when it was close. `\But he already won at that point.

If anything it'd be a combo of future picks and one big man for Cousins.

and maybe 1a being someone who can help him stop trying to fit out and just fit in. maybe something like that.`\Tank is real boys`\He had 3 points in the first half, somehow`\Yeah, him and Malone were definitely wayyy closer than him and Karl, but immaturity has been a theme throughout boogies career so it's not like Malone had him acting professionally all the time. It sucks because I love having boogie on our team. He's one of the few draft picks we've had that has superstar potential.

Lord have mercy`\ref just told Koufos he was bitching at the wrong guy cause he didn't blow the whistle lol`\Not saying I disagree with you, but I think a lot of people use Boogie's behavior on the Olympic team as evidence that he CAN be a good teammate. And if he CAN be a good teammate in that ideal situation, then it must be his organization's fault that he's a bad teammate in Sacramento. `\Remarkable. That's just pure talent right there.

We lost ball movement, and made our defense worse than it already is.

Also, JR is going back to his blackhole plays again now that the ball has been stuck in Lou's hands again.  I think JR feels like he has to ISO since he knows he wont get the ball back from Lou.

Honestly, I'm not surprised this happened once Lou came back.  I also think this is on purpose from the coach point of view.  This is how we tank without looking like we do it on purpose, IMO.`\Favors is my spirit animal. `\this is why rondo can sometimes be detrimental to a team, literally just held it there for like 10+ seconds, if you don't have anything move the goddam ball`\I know there will definitely be some movement, ideally though, I'd let them all grow together. Not to compare us to the Warriors, but they kept their crew together for 5 or so years for the most part and that's when they became the juggernaut they are.`\Of course it's time. There's no way Cousins is staying when his contract ends and the Kings will struggle the next 2 years he's there to field a .500 team let alone a contender.

It doesn't matter what assets they get for him anyways. Kings Ownership/FO have shown nothing that indicates they would do anything more than squander whatever they'd receive in exchange for Boogie. Yeah, I know, its sadly ironic a Lakers fan is criticising another team's FO but the Kings are a dumpster fire. They need an entire organizational restructuring.

Move Boogie, end this retardation. `\And Boban. He's a point and a rebound from a double double. But I just want to see the Red Rocket one last time.`\Didn't they have to forfeit a game because they didn't understand the player assignment rules?`\KAT is love, KAT is life`\That was the prettiest move I've seen from Ben all year :')`\eh, Collison has proven to be no more than a premier bench guard. They have legit talent in Gay and Boogie though obvs, those are trade centerpieces that teams will actually want. McLemore is a bum though. They definitely have talent on their roster, something just isn't right`\What world are you living in where you think that's enough?  The article was written by a journalist, not our GM, so his value doesn't suddenly drop due to people in town getting tired of him. `\I always want to re-sign guys, but this team is playing so well together, outperforming even the highest of predictions, and they are so young. I say we try to keep people around, Harkless, AC and Meyers and Davis all.


I'm definitely with you on Harkless too. He fits exactly the style we've been looking for in a 4. T-Rob was good but not a shooter, JJ Hickson was good but also not a shooter or decent with the ball. Hark is all those things.`\i wasnt stating his value i'm just saying a trade i'd love to see even if its biased.

hes still the best center in the league rn`\I think you have a horrible mix of a player who is extremely frustrated with losing/lacks maturity along with a coach who is on his way out and is clearly fed up with his team. `\Who's in 4th right now? MEM in 5th, we're in 6th.`\Kyrie barely breathing RIP`\Cause Cousins is a cancer and can leave in two years. Is it really that hard to understand? Dude is not a winning player, how do people STILL not realize that??`\>Or would you just trade Cousins while his value is high.

This one. Collect for him, as one might say, a Kings Ransom.`\Back to writing this goddamned script. I've been doing this shit all day and it's probably going to take all day tomorrow too. Kill me`\This game is a mess but I'm enjoying it`\*Whoosh*`\*pocket sand*`\We've been lucky, dude is crazy good still.`\WCS definitely has a lot to learn strategically about defense. Love him though.`\You know I hate to be the guy who mentions the refs but how are you gonna lead your elbow into someone and get the bucket plus the foul `\He's seriously the worst `\[Let me guess. This is you](http://i.imgur.com/1F4QL1x.gif)`\I don't think Philly takes that. They already have the Kings by the balls with their pick swaps. They could give up the 1 overall for Boogie, and then like a role player with it.`\[baskertball!!!](https://media.giphy.com/media/FSBSB5UDRomuQ/giphy.gif)`\That kings roster with IT, Cousins and Gay had at least as much talent as the 2013 rockets`\damn, what if boogie+KD`\Eh ?`\spurs dj is on fire recently. `\rip Kings`\fixed`\The comment says 1st pick, so I was using the most likely team to discuss. Of course cousins is better now, but he's also older and his contract expires much quicker. The sixers aren't in win now mode, why would they give up a young developing center and a potential superstar for a player who is older and could leave them sooner. Boogie is a great player, they'd love to acquire him, I just don't think including the First overall this year if they have it makes sense at all. It goes against their plan and logic. If the Kings wanted to rebuild and get some of their 1sts back from the sixers, Okafor/Noel/Embiid + a sac pick and future sixers picks would make the most sense for the sixers. I'm not saying the Kings would accept, but the sixers, like the Celtics, have lots of picks to offer. I also don't agree that the sixers would risk giving away a potential superstar and a young center for an amazing player that is a UFA after 2 seasons. `\holy shit Grant is tearing it up. Hopefully Phil starts to see the error of his ways and plays him instead of Jose or Sasha.`\Was that even KCP's foul?  Looks a lot like DMC hooked KCP in...

EDIT: After replays, that's clearly a fake from DMC, not even that great an acting job :/`\He doesnt do it for NBA cares. He genuinely likes to help out the Sacramento area and has helped hundreds of families there. If you don't like his attitude on the court that's one thing, I don't like it either, but stop talking shit about the guys character when you've only watched him on TV. `\I would try to make a Ben Simmons trade to whoever gets the number 1 pick`\9 is not a seed.  `\Our monthly mystery illness `\"Back and forth they go, where they finish, nobody knows." Buck just summed up the Wiz's whole season with that line.`\CJ just turned on the jets!`\meh not really, collison is a great back up PG, who can start if needed and on a cheap as hell contract`\Why bother keeping Demarcus at this point? He's fed up with this organization and they can't win with them regardless`\Honestly, the biggest difference is that draymond is on a wildly successful team. Really, that's basically it. If the Warriors were garbage, we'd see his 'savvy trash talk' as a garbage loser move.`\Wtf? Was ESPN hijacked by a random redditor? `\Lol dude I see you every board talking about Dangelo get off his dick already.. `\Except Karl only gave him 6 minutes tonight because he ran out of shits to give about this team a few months ago. `\https://twitter.com/ZachLowe_NBA/status/705601745678950400`\Boogie's remaining contract is going to seem like pennies on the dollar once the cap explodes the next couple seasons. And with the constant rumors of head clashes among him/coaches/management, it's best they simply part ways and trade him over the summer. Unless fans want to keep hearing about the drama for two more damn seasons. `\Collison, Casspi, Cauley-Stein, Curry and Costa Coufos could cause chaos`\Parsons is almost singlehandedly keeping the Mavs in this one`\Thank you. Exactly.

Fuck this sub`\I'm late. Go Kings!`\Hm.  Testicle injury and suddenly improving and implausible athletic performance.  Someone check Manu for EPO and blood doping.`\wow...`\Curious what makes him explode on Karl like that. I understand he's a ticking time bomb, but wonder what it was that set him off exactly.

Also, check out Willie laughing it off lol `\Hey Peja,
How many cigarettes/cigars has Vlade gone through today? Feel free to round to the nearest dozen.`\they shoulda traded him already when lakers wanted him`\ED FUCKING DAVIS`\Does anyone else think they should introduce the one and one foul shooting in the NBA?`\Hi Peja! Big fan man. Do you have any cool/funny stories from behind the scenes that you'd be willing to share? I know everyone here would love that.

Good luck with everything in the future!`\Very classy.`\I'm in agreement with keeping an entertaining game, so long that you can guarantee 100% that the Blazers win. Deal? Deal.`\I'm late, what did I miss?`\Yes, super seriously.  It took 10 whole seconds.  Crazy isn't it?

It's easy to say "he's young he'll figure it out" but look at a guy like Ricky Rubio. He has yet to figure out the shooting part and it's prevented him from being a top-flight point guard. Ricky is fantastic at running the offense, a very good defender and a plus rebounder, but that shooting is always going to limit him. Same goes for Simmons potentially.`\Morris with  another good game.`\dude really? matt barnes is washed. allen can't score. zbo is getting older, although he's still a 15-7 guy.

They cut 12M in cap and get a sure fire hit that right away fulfills two out of 3 of Cousins strengths (passing and rebounding).

He'd be really complimentary to WCS, and surrounding those guys with shooters instead of a playmaker like Rondo would transform the team rather than full on rebuild it (as in have a season like the Lakers to get the pick that lands Simmons).`\Really glad that Manu came back strong.

With him on the team as the team was in those losses, more of them wouldn't be losses. We have like 0 big man depth and have had so many injuries. Boogie being on the team (and being healthy) would alleviate both of those problems.

Also, I think you are insane for not wanting him on our team. He literally does EVERYTHING we could possibly need from a big man.`\Damn, that was nice`\But what about the rest of Cousins' career.

Fournier or Oladipo? `\Rondo was definitely moving when the contact occurred though.`\Yeah I think that'd be a tough one for the Celtics to pull the trigger on.  I do genuinely think that trading for Boogie in this case would be beneficial to the Celtics.  Boston has such a good environment and Boogie definitely needs a fresh start.  A focused DeMarcus is definitely worth it, and like Isaiah, he's loyal to a fault.  You guys would not only be a good trade destination, but I'm sure he'd re-sign when his contract runs out in a couple years.

I feel like if Russ or KD got hurt, a Portland/OKC series would go 7 games.`\The Kings fucked up when they fired Mike Malone. Should have traded him. I think the Kings and Boogie just need to part ways because it's just a toxic relationship now, imo, even before Karl became the HC but that definitely made it worse. Karl wanted Boogie gone and I'm sure the feeling is mutual. I realize talent like Boogie is hard to find, but at some point you just gotta cut your losses, pull in a nice haul for the talent and move on.`\get kat the ball on offense please`\Karl is complaining to a ref about a call on Cousins?

Adjusted for our pace, Mike Conley is easily one of the best point guards out there, and now that we are playing at a faster pace and we aren't spreading the scoring as much it really shows. Throw in one of the best assist to TO ratios in the league and you've got a guy near or at the max.`\Give ya Clarkson and Randle and a couple of second rounders for him?`\You can't get the #1 pick.

Draymond gets a lot of techs and does whine to refs but he never lets it clearly affect his level of effort on the court like Boogie does. `\When will y'all stop with these stupid questions?`\What player did you enjoy playing against the most? `\This really should have happened the first time he blew up at Karl this year when he cursed him out in the locker room. It doesn't matter how bad Karl has been or the fact he's gone after this year anyway. It's just unacceptable to snap on your coach like that especially in public.

I understand why he's angry about everything. Little talent around him, unstable roster, unstable ownership, relocation rumors, trading away the one coach he connected with, the new coach tries to trade you, etc.

At some point, though, you have to let all that go, learn to control your emotions, and be the leader your team needs. There comes a time your sulking and outbursts due to your emotions become bad for morale and at least some of the blame falls on you.

Unfortunately I just don't think there's any saving the relationship between Boogie and the Kings. It's been toxic for a long time. It's become arguable whether you'd be better off just giving him a fresh start elsewhere and resetting with a new coach, new GM, and whatever assets and draft picks you can get for him. You just can't keep changing coaches hoping this is the one as Cousins gets more and more frustrated with the organization. Now with Vlade and Karl soon out I think that's become a more realistic option than ever. `\I'm confused on why some people here are referring to Cousins as a "superstar" when he most certainly isn't. Maybe it's semantics, but superstars are Durant, Curry, and Lebron etc. Cousins is absolutely NOT in that tier.  Don't get me wrong he's a great player and possibly a franchise player! But totally not a superstar. `\I do, there no incentive for Brooklyn to be bad, they have no picks it just help Boston get better. Signing some competent fa for the next 3 years seed  then they bottom out is better for Brooklyn.`\I really do legitimately go back and forth on this. Obviously he is an elite player, and probably the best center in the league, but I just can't imagine this behavior is good for team morale. I also wouldn't want to watch him complain about calls the way he does.

In the end I think you have to take him if you get the chance obviously, but I really think this is a real behavioral problem at this point, based on how often stories like this arise.`\Would you think a guy who averaged 26.2pts/game on 56% shooting and 12.4reb/game in his lone year of college ball would be a non-injury bust? Because he was. Good stats at the college level don't really mean that much in terms of projecting future NBA production.`\If I'm the GM in this scenario, I'm starting the conversation with Boogie for Russell +#2`\Block party.`\Salty`\Randle and Cousins`\THATS A FUCKING FOUL >_>`\Trade boogie. They really need to hit that reset button again, because of how toxic the atmosphere is there. They can't bow down to demarcus and need to create a positive winning environment.

They would be better off trading people and trying to get assets for the future, but one way or another they need to fix the atmosphere around the whole organization.

`\This game gives me life`\No, it's legitimate. If you think Cousins whines, then you haven't seen Jason Thompson.

The only difference is Cousins is legitimately a star now, and does get fouled quite often.

If you think JT is a great guy/role model on the court you just haven't seen enough of him yet. I'm not talking about off the court, as Cousins has 0 issues off the court.`\Hey Peja you're my idol when I was younger. Allen Iverson was only my second favorite player at the time because of you and the Sacramento Kings.

I don't really have a question. Just wanna say how awesome you are. If anything, can you confirm or deny, I've been hearing you had a Paul George-like injury before you got to the NBA, is that true?`\Why would Karl try to get Cousins traded immediately when he wanted to coach him very badly in Denver, and knows he is one of the best centers in the league? The issues between Cousins and Karl did not start until the end of the season when Karl said that nobody was untradable and Cousins got butt hurt. `\Rondo with the 10 assists and 5 Turnovers with a -10

Then they demanded that they get rid of George Karl, but the team refused to make a change. So the fans are mad again.`\Simba out here doing things`\Collison 6MOTY`\Now this is Spurs basketball.`\Are there any plans to bring Jason Williams into a front office position?`\My point is that I don't think it matters what his physical prime is when the mental traits are the limiting factor. Obviously it's speculation, as is any attempt at a future prediction, but Boogie just has too many mental flaws that are most likely unfixable for him to be that guy afaic.`\BONNER IN, GET RDY!`\I know we're not going to get to see it this year, but I want to re-iterate that it's a shame we're not going to get to see Cousins play in the postseason yet another year.  `\kaiser permanente mini-ball... more like kaiser permanente mini-skirt`\:( My dreams are crushed`\Warriors swept the Kings

I have a few things I've always wanted to say to you:

1. Ever since you retired, it's been increasingly difficult to introduce myself.. before, it was as easy as "Peja, like the NBA player." Please consider coming out of retirement.

2. On that note - why is it so hard to pronounce our name correctly? Even the basketball-reference.com page says "PAY-zhah".. it's just 2 syllables. I don't get it.

3. Are you still bitter about 2002? I think I became a much more cynical person after that Lakers series.

4. Do you remember this play? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JlkB6kpSi_k

I grew up in Sacramento and I remember how great the early 2000 Kings teams that you were apart of were.

However trading him for 2 starting caliber players AND two picks definitely gives the team a better chance of winning. If Beal could stay healthy he would what this team desperately needs, outside shooting. He might not be able to coexist with such a ball dominant PG like Rondo but we all know he's gone after this season.
We really need to get something out of Boogie before he walks away from us at the end of his contract. Nobody's coming here from free agency. We are a mess.

`\5 questions, I guess.  Feel free to pick and choose:

* What do your job responsibilities look like?  i.e. what distinguishes your responsibilities from Vlade's or Mike Bratz's?
* Which player's performance this year are you most happy about -- obviously the organization has a lot to be disappointed about from this year, but is there any one player whose improvement or effort or attitude you'd especially like to praise?
* What do you think about media coverage of the Kings?  I can't imagine hearing things like [This article](http://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nba/kings/2016/03/16/should-sacramento-kings-trade-demarcus-cousins/81866080/?hootPostID=1a0180f7b13f9b918d288d0aeeed308b) out of any other organization, and the whole kerfuffle about possibly firing Karl around the all-star break was a little weird too.  Do you think the media just sees y'all as an easy target with the recent turnover?
* One of my favorite games this year (Though I imagine not one of yours) was decided by a shot on which Troy Daniels travelled, but the refereeing throughout the OT was so bad that it wasn't even a blip on the radar.  Is there anything the NBA can do about the refereeing, or is it just something that's so impossibly hard to see everything that it's really not fixable?
* How would the Kings locker room handle something like the current D'angelo Russell situation -- where he's the future of the franchise, being ostracized by a bunch of guys who probably won't even be there in 2 years, but it might affect other players' decisions around him.  Are the Lakers kind of just in a position where they need to (perhaps in different words) tell everyone involved to grow up and act like a professional, or is there some other solution.`\That's what everyone said about the Lakers when they traded four picks for Steve Nash. `\My video shows bullshit calls in the lakers favor which is why I think it was rigged. You're just giving me free throw disparity, which could mean the kings were more aggressive in game 3? Free throw disparity is common, but are calls like those common??? `\Classic Manu. `\Seth Curry seems like he's got a solid game together, needs to work more on his shooting. James Anderson on the other hand...`\Do you ever think you can win 40 games with the Boogie-Rondo duo? Be honest. `\Late to the party but here is my take.

* First, the "is Cousins the issue or are the Kings the issue" argument is dumb. Any NBA executive knows that they are both issues that have compounded into something bigger.

* Vivek needs to understand that a rebuild is needed and takes time. He needs to stop overrulling the people he pays to make decisions and take a more laisse faire approach.

* Cousins has to be traded. As much as I want it to work, the lack of strong management and strong player leadership has made it a toxic relationship.

* George Karl has to go. I would look at Doug Collins or Van Gundy or any other established NBA coach that would take a rebuilding job.

* Vlade needs to go. There are too many stories about his leadership. Where there is smoke there is fire.

* Tank next year. Rondo is most likely gone. Trade for assests this year and next year. Try to aim for 2017 and 2018. It is unfair to call a draft class bad, but this one supposedly is. Extra picks and their own good pick (or whoever they have to swap with) will be great assests in 2017 and beyond. Plus with the cap rising, rookie contracts are going to be super valuable.

* The west is aging. The Spurs are old, the Warriors are in their prime, Chris Paul is aging, and Durant and Westbrook could leave OKC. In 3 years the West will look way different and probably weaker. I try for a 3-4 year rebuild (not Sixers level).

* After trading assets and have crazy amounts of caproom with the new cap, I try to bring in veteran presences. Andre Miller is someone who comes to minds. The Kings need a good locker room. After tanking for 1 year, I try to be competitive. Don't overpay for free agents Tyson Chandler style, but bring in real NBA talent and compete. With veterans, an average respected coach, and some strong young talent the Kings could be this years Wolves in 2018.

The goal has to be a title. I know they want to make the playoffs, but Vivek has to suck it up and bring a shit team into a new arena. It sucks, but they dug their own grave.`\When exactly? Maybe that lone win against San Antonio? That's about it really.`\Is Courtney Taylor-Taylor as big of a douche in real life as he appears to be in every other place he's found?`\Lol no one is giving up a massive package for someone with major attitude issues that can walk in two years. Sure, you can get a high pick and a solid young player, but nothing more.`\Manu has to be one of the basketball Elder Gods`\Nah I'd say you're over rating those guys greatly. `\He's definitely not a bad person but you can't call his problems "minor immaturity issues."  He has been in the league 6 years now and has shown no signs of mengal improvement despite constantly talking about how he wants to be a leader, change the face of Sac etc...  I don't think he can control it.  I think it's more along the lines of chemical imbalances that he might never conquer.

I'll defend him as a moral person, but I will definitely not write off this as simple "oh hes just a little immature."
`\What a weak call`\LETS GO KINGS!!!`\Lol i really hope you get the first 2 picks`\I agree with you.

My statement was erroneous, it isn't that Karl isn't a problem. But rather that he's part of a huge amount of issues within the team.

He's a big part of the problem, as you've said. And this is coupled with a bad team culture as well as an ownership that doesn't know what the hell it is doing.`\finally found a reliable stream for this. kings putting up a good game?`\DAMNNNN KOSTA`\We could go big and play Rudy Gay at the 2. `\Dude.

Go Boogie!`\Hey Peja, thank you for doing this I'm a big fan of you. My question for you is which player was the most difficult to guard?
`\Malone had Boogie cookin last year. I am confident that with a few guys helping to keep him in check, he is still a force on a contender.

he just should never be relied on to be the best player and top leader on a team. Put him on the Celts, or trade kLove for him, and he'd be a beast. Gotta have a very strong leader in place, or a super-duper star who is obviously the alpha dog.

IMO - Celts/Cavs/Den/Lakers (under certain circumstances including getting a top coach and KD)/ maybe Dallas would all be better teams with Boogie and be able to handle him (more or less).`\Huertas shot was closer than Caspi's freethrow.`\Set Boogie free! He doesn't deserve this shit`\You can just imagine MB just staring at Rice after that attepted joke. `\Grandpa ball`\a man climbing a small ladder`\Yeah, it's nonsense. Keep in mind you just didn't offer IT and Crowder, but also three other players AND a top5 pick. Basically everything Boston has.

I don't fucking care if Cousins is the best center in the league or not. Your trade proposal would set the C's rebuild two or three years back and I'm glad Danny Ainge would never do that.

If the Kings don't want the BKN picks and our role players that's fine. The C's also aren't trading all of their assets for the best center in the league who also never showed any signs of maturity and being a guy you could build around. You do that trade and we are a poor man's Sacramento.`\Keep

DeMarcus Cousins, Omri Casspi, Darren Collison, Willie Cauley-Stein

Probably keep

Acy

Maybe keep

Ben McLemore, Marco Belinelli, Rudy Gay

Fire George Karl

Try and get a defensive big that can guard stretch 4s. Try and get a backup point guard. Maybe get a 4th option big. Maybe get another 2 guard if we aren't keeping either or both of McLemore/Belinelli.

I'd still try and get the program to work with Cousins for one more year or two if I'm feeling that he would like to stay, which I am feeling right now. Only problem is age -- but he isn't that old yet.

Rondo isn't a priority. I would rather he go somewhere else.`\Karl insists of switching everything imaginable `\that's gotta hurt for dallas`\There is a good 24 hour pizza place downtown in Sacramento. Does Bear like pizza?`\I think he's just unwilling to accept responsbility for his failures to be honest.`\He liked Malone.

Firing Malone was the worst move the organization has made in the past few seasons. I think they were 6-7 when they fired him. And Boogie liked him. And Malone has done well enough in Denver. Not great but they have a very young team.

Meanwhile Karl never looks like he knows where he is and rumors that he wanted to trade Boogie surfaced soon after he arrived.

Like, oh my god, what are you doing?`\That was the best move McLemore has made all season`\You're funny`\Thanks to Rondo?`\Come back, Marco...come back... :(`\Man, what a shot by Conley!`\haha that pass. `\Man, this joke is tired`\Cousins is the anti spur.

Solid pick.`\Lol these Kings announcers were not a fan of that Gortat foul call `\I believe so`\For once Cousins hasn't dominated us`\Cousins most certainly does not have the same personality as all top tier NBA talents.  That's a ridiculous statement.  And again, justifying someone's shitty behavior by pointing to other people in history who have had shitty behavior is an extremely weak argument.

I never said the Kings weren't a shitty organization, so please don't act like I'm defending them.  That point was never in contention.  But to say every other organization can handle Cousins is just wrong.  You say the Lakers know how to pander to a star, but you posted like four times the example of Kobe exhibiting bad behavior.  So which is it?  And the current Lakers have a competent front office?  Really?

I'd love to see posts from people that call out Cousins and only Cousins while absolving the Kings.  It seems like you think that if someone criticizes Cousins but doesn't also explicitly state that the Kings are at fault as well, they somehow are putting all the blame on Cousins. `\Brooklyn has the best basketball court in the NBA.`\They have to play nice because they want him to stay`\He started working on it at the beginning of last year. Boogie can hit one too. Even Whiteside has tried to jack a few up this season.

The kings had 1 okay season and a bunch of bad ones.`\jesus christ love`\Bro, we want that 4th Spot! Give us HCA and let's run the Clippers out in the First Round, BWAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA! But seriously, we want the Clippers in the Playoffs this season, and if we can somehow move up to the 4th Seed, that'd be great!`\no don't they play 4 on 5`\Harkless is so good. he really is. I never get why we stop playing him.

Amazing transition D, stretch 4, great rebounder...why does he not get time? He's out of control sometimes and has a knack for missing easy layups, but there's so much talent there.

He's the man we need to re-sign -- more than Crabbe and Meyers`\Clutch rebounding by Collison ha`\I don't think so. At all. At least nothing off the top of my head. `\What's that? I can't hear from under this bus.`\Miller looks really athletic for being 80 `\He's learnding!`\Boogie's contract is now one of the biggest bargains in the NBA. He's going to top out at $16.8 million in the 2017/18 season when the Cap will be around $100 million or more. You can't ask for much more than that from a guy that's already a superstar.

Collison is also a very good backup PG that makes $5 million. He's another bargain.

Obviously they aren't rookie contracts, but you're getting a legit superstar for less money than Rudy Gay was getting paid on his last contract...`\What was the technical for? Shit talking?`\"Look at Andre Miller, he's in his 45th year"`\foh casspi`\He still acts like a coddled child star.`\Hi Peja, what's been your greatest memory of your playing days?`\That kid explains my emotions`\Hi Peja,

Two players touch the ball on average on each of our possessions. The triangle is fucking shit. Phil is gonna run this team to the ground and return to LA or some shit. He's had time to fix this team and his offense sucks horse dick.`\this is some of the worst defense I've seen in a while`\Shit back in the Webber era we used to look at you guys and think the same thing. `\He looks like a gazelle out there`\He gets the tank `\We have plenty of shooters.

How many *would* click with him?`\Wait, what? Cousins for the Nets pick straight up in a two man draft?

Are you Billy King?`\I'd say trade him in the summer but gonna be hard to convince teams to take him when he can leave after the next season. In this case could be nice to boogie and ask him to narrow down 2-4 teams he would like to go to and see what best deal you can get from them. `\*#* she belongs.  `\Does it matter why he wanted to considering it's entirely not his job to make trades? and he was alone in the idea of wanting Cousins traded, also. `\I need a replay of that monster poster by Quincy Acy in my life. Someone, please.`\Because he makes our team better man. I don't know why you guys can't see that.

When he was healthy this year and last year he was one of the best three point shooters in the league and a consistent 18+ point scorer.

His defense isn't good but it's way underrated.

He's become a better ball handler and passer just over the last two seasons.

I don't see how you guys can still hate him. He didn't want to be in New Orleans. Big deal. He's a good player who makes our team objectively better, and you don't let that kind of guy walk just because he said something bad about your city 4 years ago. `\So do we?

Things are extremely bad currently, but next year we will have a brand new arena, a new coach, hopefully another decent rookie, and still have Cousins under contract (some might not see that as a good thing, but I do). `\That attempted joke. . . every attempted joke. . . `\great offense, but completely lack any sort of defense at all. bad rotations too. they also build big leads in the first half and choke them away in the second half, pretty much every game.`\I've said it before.

Boogie is the only constant in the Kings' recent suckage.`\This is pleasant `\Duncan's advice to Simmons "whatever you do...dont do something to be on Shaqtin a fool!`\Peja,

Stupid Western Conference road trips. `\I'd rather have Dwight, honestly. `\I just really don't dig the vocal style, but the lyrics are cool.`\The patented fuck you three that if missed is a bad shot from LeBron`\Um no. If we are to trade Cousins it will be for the first pick in the draft, Simmons. Then, we will also want Bradley and Crowder plus another first round pick. You do realize Cousins is a fucking superstar right? He's just about the 5th best player in the league which is insane considering we have Curry, LeBron, Westbrook, Durant all in their primes at the moment. No way we throw away Cousins for scraps. `\I completely agree with your take. As a Lakers fan and a Boogie fan, I was glad LA didn't jump into that because the timing was off. They wouldn't have had anyone to play with Boogie if they gave up all their young guys.

I think celts could overpay with draft picks and throw in olynyck instead. IT nets pick olynyck and another nets first rounder might get it done if the nets pick was high enough this year.

I fear celts giving up too much and be forced to find inferior players in FA. But I guess your offer would at least still leave them with cap space to fill around boogie.

I would still call this a major stretch. Think of Recent #3 players on championship teams: 2015: Klay Thompson, 2014: Tony Parker, 2013: D Wade, 2012: Bosh, 2011: Jason Terry.

I would put Gay more in the "starter on a title team" category. The problem is that no one wants to pay him what he commands if he is just going to be the #4 or #5 guy on a title team. `\What's a Canuck?`\I love having Parsons and Lee out on the floor together �� `\> Kings gave up way too many possessions in the last 9 years.

What's the over/under on Boogie having any idea who Nazem Kadri is?`\Delly is so fucking good. look at him directing the defense after his man gets past him so he doesn't get mismatched on gay. Then he has the help defense while understanding who hes guarding.`\Looking at the Celtics pay roll money wise they'd have to add more than just 1 starter unless it was Amir Johnson.

I don't remember the Johnson signing, but i don't really understand the huge pay check of 12 millions / yr except if he was signed with a possible trade situation in mind.

Maybe Johnson + a young asset + picks.`\Killin it`\Wittman might be a dumb coach but the players respect him and he respects them, and he didn't try to trade Wall. Grunfeld has made far better moves and drafted way better than the Kings have in the last 5 years. Our front office is aggressively mediocre and overall disappointing, but it's not anywhere close to the shit show that the Kings are.`\why do the kings always give up leads at crunch time`\Peja could easily be putting up godly three point numbers if he played in todays league. `\Ahh yes, how could Durant say no to the Sacramento Kings when they knock on his door`\Trade Cousins ASAP. He's pissed and will probably hold a grudge.and here's my ideal trades

I want him out of the West. Straight up. So I want young talent to build around from the east.

Three teams come to mind instantly, one being a boston trade, but couldn't work out a boston trade that would work financially that boston would agree on (I need Smart AND Brooklyn Pick)

Two trades left. Goal in mind is a fresh new start with my current lottery pick. Here's trade one
http://espn.go.com/nba/tradeMachine?tradeId=jgmc259
Orlando Instantly becomes a top 2 team in the east with their core all being under 26. They lose two of their current core members but it's a necessary evil.
Kings become a younger team that has a high ceiling and a good core to start around. Would probably have to sign+trade for this to work.

Here is trade number 2. This is crazy but would be a blockbuster if done.
http://espn.go.com/nba/tradeMachine?tradeId=h3r5979
Vonleh is still 20 so lots of time to improve. CJ becomes our new star. and we can build upon a core of them two WCS and a pick.
Cleveland fixes it's problem with love being out of place and gets a dominant center for lebron and irving to play off of. Portland is the likely team to not follow through. Cleveland would send a first round pick and we would send a conditional pick later on but I'm not sure how much Portland values their assets. This also frees up $10 Mill a year in salary for us.`\If you and Mike Bibby were to have a hotdog eating contest, who would win?`\Ouch, i feel bad for him :(`\Plumlee loves reverse dunking the ball`\lol i agree with you 100%

I don't know maybe it's harder than it looks like you said but it still baffles me. Agree to disagree I guess?

edit: changed 18 years to 5+ years to make it more reasonable.`\I get that for their specific situation they want a late lottery pick this year so they don't have to give it up so 30 wins is fine but in general 30 wins without a young, future core is one of the bleakest possible scenarios for an organization.

I think his only real crime is the Malone firing. The Kings were a legit threat to make the playoffs and then Boogie was out for two weeks and they fire the coach. The nearsightedness of their decision making is what irks people the most I think. I don't think Vlade needs to go to change the culture.

Calm down young buck `\yep!`\This is one of James' better games`\Its a little harsh on LMA, when two cornerstones in Roy and Oden went down with career injuries. The team had to rebuild again and drafted lillard, and overpayed and got heaps out of Wes and Batum prior. They nearly got Hibbert as well, who had two good years, which would have been enough to win more playoffs games. In the east they would have made noise.

The kings however haven't drafted squat. Gay was their next best player who they had to overpay to keep. And Gay is no where near as good as Roy once was.

Just like the Pelicans, the kings made shortcuts. Overpayed players. Let go of prospects. Etc. `\ottomatic longraaaaaange`\"Cuz I'll be laughing my head off, when he's burning in hell!"`\Supposedly he went off on Karl because he wasn't backing the players when they were getting calls against them.

Kings fans can go support the warriors

Everyone's a winner`\Wow, I totally forgot that Caron Butler still plays in the NBA`\FLOP WARNING`\The 2018 pick is top 7 protected though. So there's not as much upside there as you are implying. `\Hey Kings fans, look at the bright side. We could do a little mini-tank, slip below the Nuggets, Pelicans, Bucks, and Knicks, and get the 6th pick in the draft again. You'll never get that 1st rounder, Chicago.`\Simmons is a better prospect than those 2`\>  Karl wanted Boogie gone

WHO THE FUCK CARES?!?!! Seriously though, how many players a year get caught up in trade rumors? It's part of the fucking NBA. Your coach tried to trade you? Too fucking bad! Go play the fucking game like you're paid to do and stop moping around like a baby back bitch. It's really that simple.`\KCP's last 5 games: 22.4p 3.8r 1.6a`\i honestly dont know. i feel like both had conference finals aspirations. `\I can see them using the frustration to bond. It's cool to watch. `\Well when a team wins every game by 40 not even a baby like Cousins has much to complain about.`\Am I crazy to think they should trade him? The relationships there are pretty much void. You can't win with him fighting everybody.`\Rubio just keeps on getting blatantly offensively fouled without any whistles. `\I actually agree to an extent. But I think the Celtics would move their best draft assets plus 1 solid player like Avery or Sully for him. Boogie in the middle w/ the Celts coach and roster would be awesome.`\I'm sorry Kings fans but I really wish Sacramento would free Boogie.`\mavs fans would you let dirk fuck your bitch?`\Once we stepped up the defense the lead instantly stretched out. `\They're struggling with defense right now`\Another pretty poor showing by the end of our bench so far. . . and as I say that, Montero blocks/steals a shot and takes it to the hole for free throws.  Ok, that was nice.

Oy.  `\Shoutout to Jason Thompson for being a great role model.`\Defense is clearly not happening tonight `\lol`\It will depend on how many triple doubles ZBo has. `\Yeah, we still have to win most of our remaining games, and they have to lose most.

The Kings want to buid around Cousins, but fire the only coach he's shown to be compatible with. Cousins doesn't help himself with shit like this, but it consistently feels like the organization is setting him up to fail out of pure incompetence.`\lol u talking bout Rondo right? cause at first i thought u were talking bout Bonner and was like WTF`\I dont want the number 1 pick like that!   That would be horrible since Ive pretty much bet my balls the kings wouldn't be swapping picks `\mavs whitest team in the L lol`\This game needs Nick Young. Why is Nick Young stuck to the bench right now? If Kobe is out Nick Young should be our starting SF not ancient Ron Artest.`\Can you think of a former teammate whose career would've likely suffered somewhat as a result of today's social media?`\No defense this game haha`\He's the best player at his position in the entire league.
`\Rick needs to rethink these rotations, and this team needs to realize that Parsons is the 1st option now. GG Kings, I hope you're in the playoffs instead of the Rockets, give the Dubs a hell of a series`\If they get #1 pick they could trade it and Randle for him probably`\Yes, of course. And I'm saying that they are comparable prospects, and draft position is a rough way to measure that. `\Metta, Sacre and Lou. Tank is back.`\KAT put that up with only 29 minutes too.  And 4 blocks.`\Dude this game thread is so deaaaaaaaaad.

But yeah what the hell was that sequence? I was tired myself after watching that.`\Hell no. They're 23 - 48. No matter how you look at it there's just no way Mitch lost them 25 games. That's crazy mans talk.

Edit: Numbers hard.`\Wow, I knew WCS had some offensive talent, but now he's starting to surprise even me. These Kentucky bigs...`\hahahaha`\he was yelling at his team to run a certain out of bounds play because there was just 2.5 seconds left on the clock, officials thought he was yelling at them`\boogie+KD will contend but they won't win anything though. It's not a good combination.`\I would have beat those kings players ass if they mocked me like that. JK I'm a little bitch :( But that was fucked up taunting`\Acy 2 threes already! crud`\This is weird to see Kawhi so aggressive and force things, I like it...but I don't.`\MALLORY <3`\Today must be backwards day or something`\Johnson has a non-guaranteed deal. He can be traded as cap room and then released, so he's a cap filler for a draft day trade.`\What teams have the assets to make a serious offer to the Kings this offseason? Maybe the Celtics?`\lol we suck `\Hi, Peja! Thanks for everything! Would still have retired in 2011 had the 2010-2011 season not ended in a championship? `\Spoke too soon`\Note - the Kings have a... complicated pick situation:

2016 1st owed to CHI (protected 1-10), and will swap with Philly if they somehow win the lottery (it's the only likely way to finish below Philly now). Most likely scenario send to be them keeping it (pick 7 right now, Philly likely 1st).

2017 1st swap owed to PHI (protected 11-30, unless it is already converted in 2016)... Do you want to go all-out tank and be worse than the 76ers next season? Chances are there still pretty bad though, so damage minimal.

2018 owed to PHI. Protected 1-10... But it becomes unprotected in 2019.

They also have most of their seconds conveying in various ways to various people.

So this season is probably fine, but they're probably giving up:

A few draft spots in 2017 (if your GM action makes them worse than Philly).

An unprotected first in 2019 if they're still bad then.

Having said all that, it's basically a sunk cost at this point. You lose those picks anyway (unless you're better than 11 next year and so good in 18/19 that it doesn't matter).

Seeing as they are so bad this year, I don't see many better scenarios than only giving up a back end of the lottery pick in 2018.

It's not worth holding off a rebuild to finish outside the playoffs for three more years and letting Boogie go anyway.`\I'm over his bullshit. He's negative as hell and not a good teammate. Once he's gone we can start rebuilding again, and I don't care how long it extends our playoff drought. `\Simmons and Randle have similar games, and that is the question mark. Both goes for iso ball opportunities, rebounds well, but Simmons has better vision and better finishing that Randle. It's a big IF if he does develop a better jumpshot/3-point shot. Yes, it can be fixed, but we said the same thing about Dwight's free throws. Sometimes it just can't be fixed.

If we add Boogie and Randle, it'll be a nightmare down the post, in terms of power and strength. Those two will be rebounding machines for days and can lead the fast break. It's a dream to have Randle, Boogie, Russell and Clarkson 'cause that lineup can't be stopped. You got inside and outside shooting, and the best part? they are still very young.`\sadly you don't face the Kings every game`\That would be interesting.

I think that really depends on who is picking 4 and who the Pelicans might take.

I don't think there is a consensus #3 prospect this coming draft, so we could potentially get our preferred player at #5 in this scenario.`\manu is a god. `\that off hand fake is always so cool...kyrie's got them creative finishes`\Can I get a Kayte Christensen flair?`\You cited to Kobe as an example of a player who went off the rails and caused the same awful distractions as Cousins.  You were using it as example of an equally terrible situation.  So, we are to believe it was bad.  Then, you used it as an example of a good situation, in that it showed an organization that was willing to "pander" to a star.  So, no - I don't get it.

Not going to argue anymore with someone who thinks the Lakers have a competent front office.  Have to agree to disagree on that one.

You picked three good players from the last 15 years.  If all of those people embody top-tier talent and the personality that LITERALLY ALL top-tier talent has, then you must be unfamiliar with 90% of the rest of the league.  I don't have to provide examples stars who don't behave like Cousins, because that is the norm, rather than the exception, which is what you listed.  But if you want, how about the last two MVP winners?

And, you proved my point. You can't point to a single article or comment that blames Cousins and absolves the Kings.  You just want every negative Cousins opinion to be followed by a lengthy disclaimer that states that the Kings are also at fault.`\MANU JABLOWME`\Continuation? `\First question: What is the funniest thing a fan has done/said to you?

Second question: What was your favorite arena to play in( not named Arco)`\I'm playing 2k with Sacramento against someone who picked the spurs right now.`\So sad.

DeMarcus on Boston would make them a contender.`\HOLY FUCK KID`\23 posts lol. Goddamn`\Let's talk after the draft lottery`\Manu may be old, but that man is still my favorite player ever. He can't move like he used to, but he still plays with every bit the passion and flair that made me fall in love with his game. His game really does remind me of a creative soccer player sometimes.`\I must have missed it.  Honestly, they're total homers, but not to the point where they're unfair.  It's probably because you guys rarely lose at home, or lose for that matter so it gets on people's nerve to hear the home announcers be happy when their team is losing.`\about to have a s s s s stroke`\Annnnd........we have an 8 point lead again? What even is this game`\I'm sorry but I'm tired of that answer protecting Boogie. It seems ridiculous to me to say that Draymond would also show the same lack of effort if his team wasn't winning. Draymond is a super high motor player and you cannot say the same thing of Boogie. `\Delly`\Eek. Bad end. `\BECKY BLOUSES`\refs wanted to get out of the stadium alive.`\Well, they couldn't make noise because literally every starter was hurt. A bench of CJ, Crabbe, Hendo, Vonleh, Leonard, and Plums alleviates the minutes issue though.

I'm not saying I'm not extremely excited about the current team though. Realistically, they won't win a series this year, but they have a bright future. `\Trade Cousins to the Lakers for Randle + Clarkson + 2016 pick (assuming it doesn't go to Sixers), ship out everyone not named Willie Cauley-Stein, fire George Karl, hire a developmental coach, and embrace the tank for that (supposedly) deep 2017 draft.`\Where are you getting your stats?

That's how he's been this season`\Cleveland Browns of the NBA`\I know I shouldn't... but they're getting me excited`\No way the King's get full value out of him. They could try and salvage him with the right coach and some complimentary talent pickups in the off season. `\https://twitter.com/jrrap77/status/707798680443731969`\Honestly it would have to be something like JV, Ross and like 3 picks and even then not likely. `\this game thread is so dead that i opened it a new browser cause i thought comments weren't loading`\Kevin Durant tho`\Racist? Take a chill pill homie`\No shit with such bad looks. Not one shot coming off a screen or in a pick and roll. Just keep it simple with Melo out. KP always rush it when he doesn't get involved in the offense. He always ends up trying to create off the dribble or shooting a long three on a bad look. Just run some simple plays with him so players like Grant and Dwill can get some seperation with a pick. We need more pick and rolls with RoLo or KP. This triangle offense looks so outdated in a pick and roll heavy NBA.`\Hey Peja, who was your favorite teammate to play with, and how intimidating and difficult was facing Kobe and Shaq in the WCF?`\Wait who do you have named Bogdan on the Suns?`\The inmates are running the asylum and I love it!`\Good lord. Lots of trees are gonna be planted tonight. `\How can you NOT love Acy???

Q is that dude!!!`\Most definitely, I try not to defend Boogie on everything.

He has a lot of growing to do and if he wants to be an MVP, he needs to lead by example...less technicals and arguing with refs, getting back on defense with hustle.

But I will defend him when people take it a step further and try to paint him as the reason we are as bad as we are or try to say events like this make him a bad teammate.

These certainly don't make him a good teammate, but his relationship with a coach who's as good as gone doesn't really matter to me.`\Yeah no shit. I'm pointing out that you didn't read both conditions I suggested as seemingly good environments for Boogie to thrive. I didn't say both had to be met. So, your question presumed something that I clearly didn't say.`\Willie Cauley-Stein looks like a ghetto Corey Joseph.`\Trade any valuable assets for picks and then convince my owner that it's the start of "The Process".`\Even outside of skillset. Mindset.`\It'll be the first time since '07, right?`\Just playing against Lakers things `\This guy has had 6 years to get it together and learn how to be a grown-up. "But he doesn't get arrested!" is the common refrain that gets parroted on the sub about Cousins to excuse his shitty attitude, but he gets zero credit from me for that, that's what you're supposed to do as a civilized human being. He's a huge baby and I wouldn't trade E'twaun Moore for him, I want guys with character on my squad EDIT: well, maybe E'twaun.`\I thought that was a myth.`\That was pretty.`\Boogie is a good player but everytime he does stupid shit. He kills the kings momentum. Too much of an emotional player brings down the team. `\Ne voli nas ��`\He's not the greatest, but at least he doesn't make stupid mistakes.`\If only he had a great passing PG like Rondo, wonder what they would be able to do together!`\Exactly so no one should worry about us getting both and just let it happen.`\Collison might get you a late first.`\The 8th seed being a possibility was a sign of improvement. Kings fans haven't seen that in a long time. This roster is the most talented we have had in years, but the effort was what we are missing. A new arena, and a new coach CAN change the effort levels. I get that it's on the players, but Karl doesn't give a shit about this team, that's not very motivating.

Vlade is not a bad GM. He could use some help though. Vivek has stepped back and focused more on the arena and less on the basketball that is going to be played in it.

This has been a mess, but in the big picture, it is slowly clearing up bit by bit. `\You should be pumped being a Wolves fan! so much promise`\There is no "however." Plenty of players have been almost traded. Hell, D-Mo and others have actually been traded, had the trade rescinded, and gone back to the team.

Cousins is so despicable. Does he not have a shred of respect for authority? What the hell is wrong with this guy? Who raised him? How many times does this have to happen before the Kings get this guy out of Sacramento? No amount of NBA Cares events can change that this guy is just a terrible person.`\I love RoLo as much as RoLo hates mascots.`\Yeah but he's a Stat stuffer, so it doesn't count...`\wowowowowwowowowowow rude`\dirk with that German precision`\RONFO SUCKS!?`\Still possible, but the Rockets need to lose to keep it close.`\Babbitt did a masterful job on Cousins there`\Yeah he sounds like a cranky old guy`\Was this really the same team that beat the Warriors a couple weeks back?`\Give the team up to the NBA.`\With the cap jump it would work.  The Lakers will have enough room to absorb his entire contract with room to spare for another max player if they so chose.`\what happened to the last one?`\I think he's talking about the Kings `\https://pbs.twimg.com/media/BpBSuAyIYAAzrj8.jpg`\Love when Collison dunks`\Rondo has blown by D will so many fucking times tonight `\Because Dirk isn't Cousins. Reputations count no matter what the league says.`\Unfortunately, that criticism looks like it's hear to stay, I've already seen people moving up that number to 35 ��`\Cousins with only 10 points WTF`\What a fucking MANUVER`\Is your schedule as brutal as the ATL one I just summed up? Hehe.. Only game i missed in that list is vs Phoenix. Only "easy game" they have`\the tank never dies`\>[Jackson had convinced Kerr to come to Seattle as his coach, league sources told Yahoo Sports, only to have those plans foiled when a purchase agreement with the Sacramento Kings fell apart.](http://sports.yahoo.com/news/phil-jackson-takes-charge-of-the-knicks--james-dolan-takes-his-cue-to-get-lost-230358424.html)`\Exactly.  I'm not a fan of the court tantrums and all, but what's the alternative?  No top tier free agents are going to sign.  Recent draft history for the team has not been good, despite annual lottery picks.  This is the first time that the Kings have had truly elite player since the early 2000s.  The organization has to turn everything around.  Of course, it is possible for that to happen without Cousins.  Even with his flaws, I'd still rather try it with the top 10-15 player.`\Fuck me. Three guys should of taken a shot there. `\Yup. Helped the tank AND Sacre had a good game. What more can you ask for?`\Is the bandage on Karl's neck a result of his cancer? Pretty gnar `\Hey peja! How do you personally define the term "Big 3"? Edit: Wording.`\Pssh, it's only a 53 point lead....they can totally come back....`\Great D. Just shut down everything they tried. `\their defense is fucking horrible`\30 wins yay`\the spurs' whole MO is showing guys who need straightening out the door

they don't got time for all that`\It would also reward the hacking strategy quite a bit.`\Rudy Gay with the Shaqtin moment`\Well now we know you're not black `\Unbelievable Memphis of all people should know the ball goes into Chalmers hand in crunch time`\Boogie is so bad at help defense`\That's said almost every Kings game`\Lotta people keep saying trade Boogie but there's no Lebron in GM mode out there anymore to give a real good price for him... you're going to get robbed for whatever value he has left.  I'd keep him, and let guys like Rondo go, and get a pick for Gay if possible.

Can't do any of this without securing some kind of assurance from Vivek that he won't fuck any of this up.  Then I'd fire Karl.  Hire a decent coach, and consult with Cousins while doing this so there's no more excuses if the coach-player conflict continues.

Cousins is still a top 10, 15 player, with a bad attitude but attitude is fixable, dude's not beating women or getting too wasted to play.  Still young enough for another shot with a different coach.  `\damn JR chill on the celly you don't wanna hurt your shoulder ahhh`\No one's worried though. I only want KD for the Spurs.`\Rusty Shackleford?`\I dont watch that show, sorry`\Belinelli is so shit`\gotta involve kawhi more`\K, good luck with getting those free agents.`\Our time out situation is gonna suck if we get close with little time left `\Welcome to the Casspi show.`\Carr is such a bitch for agreeing with the flagrant foul.`\Tonight`\I was expecting a song with Duncan singing.  I'm so let down.`\Have Houston and Mavs in a multi bet.

Not looking good right now.`\I'm sorry...did I not just properly run over you?  Here, let me back up over your writhing corpse to finish the job.`\GOOD GAME DC. `\what a beaut`\Too long. It's been too fucking long.

The way this is going, idk if we're ever going to be able to see a team comparable to that group.
`\SF: Dirk ��`\Yeah Randle plays too out of control a lot and seems like he doesn't really fit into what the Lakers will try to do going forward. Nance seems like he'll work to fit the offense while Randle always seems to just plow ahead. That and he could learn to use his right hand to finish. I hope Randle becomes a star but don't see it atm.`\I enjoy nothing more than happy Cuz`\That's very true too.`\As a Spurs fan, I can honestly say I wouldn't. Don't get me wrong I recognize his talent but the Spurs have proved to me that a lot of times character goes a lot further than skill in the NBA. `\#Legends of Hip Hop`\What the hell is up with Jrue's three point shot? Same form as he's always had but they're always either super short or super long. `\Kevin love?`\like if there was a cocktail hour immediately before the all star game`\I really hope we don't cut Bonner, but if we do. I want to see him put on a wig and play of the Stars`\
