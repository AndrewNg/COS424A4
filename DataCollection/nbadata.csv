30,"I say it again, But lebron needs to adjust his game the same way jordan and Dwade have done. If he only would play that (Point-)PF position (altho i dno how love would fit than but that's another arguments). Jordan and Dwade both adjusted there game to more closer shots / fade away's when they get older, not because they are bad players but because it fits there skill set. i do not understand why he try's to force this, but when he starts perfecting that fade away, and his shot is perfect for that because he has a 2 motion shot, he will create more pressure on enemy defence. they cannot let him post to get that fade away so he will get more points in the paint of the closer defence, resulting in also getting more open looks for his team mates. 

I really dont see him winning another ring if he doesn't adjust his game. He is not curry, he is far from the best 3point shooter, but his game is brilliant if only he would adjust to his own skill set and play towards his strengths. Altho this does make my lebrick shirt more epic.",1,"Last night LeBron might have had the worse game of his career, and I was pretty shocked. I don't watch many Cavs games but I remember a few weeks ago Lebron was shooting awful from 3. So I did what any of us would do and went on Basketball Reference to get some details/numbers and they were disappointing to say the least. First I found LeBron is having one of his worst years yet. Everything, beside rebounds, is worse than his career avg. Then I  looked over it again and notice LeBron is shooting 25% from 3 while attempting 4 a game. Then I looked up how long this shooting funk has been going, and OMG its worse than I thought. In his last 15 games LeBron is shooting 18.5% from 3, also committing almost 4 TOVs a game. Completely mind blown I did more digging and found his shot chart. To put numbers to that chart, anything 3ft or further from the rim Lebron only make 32% of it. On top of all that LeBron has only made 5 3s in he month of December and He only has 2 games left. Again I don't watch many Cavs, so why is LeBron shooting this bad?",http://reddit.com/r/nba/comments/3yfhe8/c/d14oc9q,1458319192,nba,Why is LeBron shooting so bad?,72,3yfhe8,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/3yfhe8,1451174400

If you watch the guy, you would know that his defense improved tremendously over the years. To dismiss his defensive ability to none is ignorance.

The team trusts him to guard elite point guards like Westbrook and CP3 for a reason. I'm not saying he's the number one defender and with his size and length, it's easy to dismiss him as a lackluster defender.

128,"You know, I love Andrew Wiggins because of his potential. If he just try a little bit and play like he'll die if he didn't win, he'll really dominate the game. I think here are some reasons he's starting to get some hate

1. He looks so lifeless. I mean it's great to have cold nerves but man, a little pumpin' won't hurt.

2. He can shoot but his jumpshot looks out-of-control some times.

3. He's thin AF. Ideal 'best in the game' archetype in the eyes of NBA fans is like 6'6 to 6'8, 215 to 230 lbs. Wiggins is 6'8 200 lbs.

4. He looks like he can't psychologically intimidate the opposing team.

5. The closest superstar with the same demeanor to him is Tim Duncan, but Duncan plays with 'sting' (competitive aggression) while Wiggins rarely plays with it, if he ever played with it. Also, Timmy can rebound, defend, block, and pass.

6. He's too composed that he sticks to what he does best (scoring), but doesn't really quite dominate it like people expected.

7. His scoring is inconsistent that it can't even cover up some bad stats in specific games.

I really hope he develops, and I think he should be SG, while the SF should be a 3&amp;D guy like Khris Middleton or Jimmy Butler. PF should be a rebounder, decent defender, and a shooter.",1,"Is it just me or is there ALOT of hate towards Andrew Wiggins in this sub?

164,"&gt; have you seen a slow pick and roll in the NBA? lol it'd defeat the whole purpose.

Are you serious? There is a difference between making a quick decision, and making the right decision quickly. The latter is what Green is good at.

&gt; passing from the key to cutters is not hard if you practice and look for the cut.

Maybe not where you play, but its hard to do against NBA defenses. Theres a reason why not everyone can run their offense through their PF/C.

&gt; if green's passing is such an inherent quality

166,"Sat directly behind Byron and Kobe in TOs. First NBA game and sometimes it was hard to see being so close to the floor but to watch space cadet swaggy and hear kyrie yell shit like ""ohh shit I wanted that one"" about an almost steal that got cavs possession.

Lebron made tough buckets due to his lateral quickness and while kobe was going to town on him in the post lebron was racking up assists down the other end of the floor. Kyrie just fucks around with his dribble literally way too fast for anyone so will take everyone on 1v1. D'Lo had a great game seems to be a confident shooter now. Julius was strong and mobile but suffers from tunnel vision still good to see he can bring the ball down and start the offense if needed. Clarkson had an average game and gets down on himself like Klay and it shows in his confidence. Byrons bald head was so shiny, everyone of them are so cut even huertas who also had his best game of the season. Saw delly at the half and shouted '""aussie, aussie, aussie"" which got a smirk and wave. He played well too. Swaggy seriously looks like hes just along for the ride doesn't listen in TOs just makes jokes. 

Kobe was his typical steely eyed self tried so hard to get him to notice me and sign my Chaos Vs but he looks through you for a split second and turns. Nobody got anything from him except john legend and the NFL player at the end of the lakers bench who got five pairs of kobes. He played well and it was funny when he got annoyed at the ref for qhat he though was a soft foul, he seriously kept looking at the ref and shaking his head for about a minute you can see the pressure superstars put on the refs. Lebron was great too but had nothing on kobe in the post. He whinges alot and I couldn't beleive he didnt get a tech when he hung off the rim for 5+ seconds.

Channing frye was on fire in the first. Metta was hilarious to watch looks so stiff and awkward but goes out and hustles hard. He had some words for huertas when he switched on defense that someone else had called. 

Kobes asian trainer gave him some shoulder massage in the 3rd and it looked like it was bothering rim all game. Wouldn't be suprised if he sits out more games just to be able to finish the season.

168,He makes roberson look like steph curry,1,"Kyle Singler is the worst player in the NBA getting regular minutes.  I've felt like his nightly turds have been going under the radar, so I just wanted to make more people aware.  Awareness is the first step toward real change.A quick recap of his season:193 minutes played, zero assists. Zero. In the Zero-Assist Club, JaVale McGee is in second in terms of most minutes played without an assist. He has played 45 minutes. Shooting splits of 23.5/20/50. Those numbers don't even add up to 100. I know that's completely arbitrary and has no meaning, but still. He has a -1.16 PER. He is currently the only player in the league with a negative PER. Sasha Vujacic has a positive PER.  /u/WeRallGOATS pointed out that this is the lowest PER in NBA history among players who have played at least 150 minutes. Full ListPlease take a moment to look at his hair right now.He's averaging 8.3 fouls per 48 minutes. Tonight, he had 4 fouls in 14 minutes played. This summer, GM Sam Presti signed Kyle to a 5-year, $25 million deal. That deal runs through the summer of 2020, which sounds insane because it is insane.This truly is one of the greatest all-time slumps for a random player and I hope that more people will now be able to appreciate it.Edit: Shoutout to /u/misterquinlan for sharing this Kyle Singler Highlight Video.  It was very inspiring and after watching it multiple times, I've decided that I'm ready to believe in Kyle again.  Let's forget about these first 20 games.  They don't mean anything.

218,"They don't look better right now homie.

Lost 3 in a row with your team up next. 

Maybe you should reevaluate your weak ass analysis",1,"Here is the link if you want to read it on my blog, where the formatting is a bit nicer: LINK The race for the 8th seed isn't just about the playoffs. It's about hope. Hope for the future of your young core, hope that your aging superstar might have a few good years left, hope that when you see your friends you can talk excitedly about plans to buy playoff tickets instead of listing everything that went wrong your shitstorm of a season.To some fans and experts, it may seem silly to clamour for the 8th seed only to be systematically dismantled by an inevitable conference finalist. Why not chuck in the season, rack up some L's, and try to get a solid lottery pick? That may be what's best for the long term championship hopes of the team, but how can you deny the fans a chance to get butterflies before a big playoff game? How can you deny them the hope of watching their team go on a 10-2 run in the third quarter of game one, and then turning to a friend with a raised eyebrow that says, ""You know, if Steph has a couple of off-games, we might be able to do this thing...""The 8th seed will probably not win a series. The 8th seed might not even win a game. But the 8th seed will inject a city with fiery exhilaration for a week or two, and that excitement can be enough to carry a fanbase through to the fall, knowing that next season might hold something even more special in store. With that in mind, it's time to take a look at the teams that are battling it out for the final playoff spots in each conference. RACE FOR 8th IN THE WESTThe race for the 8th seed in the Western Conference is really the race for the 5th, 6th, 7th, and 8th seed, as the middle of the pack is tightly clustered. DALLAS MAVERICKSTo the Mavericks, making the playoffs this year means they carry on their tradition of continued excellence. The Mavericks haven't finished the season with a record below .500 since 2000, in Dirk's sophomore year. This year, people didn't really expect big things from Dallas, after they whiffed on the DeAndre Jordan sweepstakes and rolled the dice with Wes Matthews post-injury. However, the Cuban/Carlisle combo continues its winning ways, with the team sitting 3 games over .500 as of the all-star break.A lot of the Mavs' success has to do with the impressive play of Zaza Pachulia, who was picked up on a cheap contract after DeAndre decided to stay in LA. Zaza is averaging a 10 & 10 double-double, and offering some versatility on the defensive end as he can go toe-to-toe with a banger like Dwight Howard just as easily as he can disrupt KAT's finesse game.Along with the welcome surprise of Zaza's excellence, Mavs fans are also happy to see the not-so-surprising excellence of Dirk. He doesn't move as effortlessly as he used to, and he's one of the main reasons the Mavs are only so-so defensively, but the amount of times that Dirk has hit big shots for the Mavs this season is enough to get any Dallas fan excited. There's this.And this.And this.Get the point?Another thing going right for the Mavs is that they've largely been able to avoid serious injury trouble. They have missed a smattering of games here and there, but their big pieces have mostly been able to stay on the floor so far. For a roster with Deron Williams (missed 9 games), Wesley Matthews (4 games), an aging Dirk (6 games), and a recovering Chandler Parsons (8 games), avoiding a long-term injury to these key vets has got to be considered a win, even if youngster Jeremy Evans has missed more than his fair share of games. When these players have had to sit out, guys like Barea, Felton, and even Dwight Powell have stepped up to the challenge to keep Dallas' playoff aspirations alive.The Mavs have a tough stretch as they approach the last part of their season. 15 of their 27 remaining games are against teams .500 or better, including a brutal 9-game stretch where every single team boasts a winning record, including 2 games with the Warriors and one with the Cavs. The Mavericks' fate will likely be decided in this mid-to-late March run, and their ability to keep their key players on the floor will be key.This team may not have the raw hunger that a youthful team like the Blazers and Jazz have, but they have a ton of experience, and a very gifted coach. That may be enough to catapult them into the playoffs, and to give Dirk another shot at heroism. UTAH JAZZFor the Utah Jazz, the push for the playoffs is all about taking the next step. They have an exciting young core, and after missing out on the playoffs last year, this year is the supposed to vault them into ""you don't want to face them in April"" territory. Early in the season, their development was hampered by the loss of Exum, Burks, Gobert, and Favors. The latter two are now back after missing about 20 games, while Exum is out for the season and Burks is expected to return this season after missing almost two months already with no timetable set to return.That's what's gone wrong for the Jazz. But what has gone right for them is, well, a lot. In the 10 games before the break, the Jazz have the second-best defense in the league while gobbling up rebounds at the second-highest frequency as well. Having your rim protector finally rounding back into form will do that for you. Meanwhile, Rodney Hood has turned into a 3-and-Demon, who is looking like an absolute steal at the 23 spot in the 2014 draft. Hood is shooting over 42% from beyond the arc in 2016, while getting up 6.4 3s per game. Impressive stuff.But more importantly than any statistic that could be mentioned, is just how much fun it is to watch these guys play. Coach Quinn has got them working so hard that any team who doesn't come out ready to play will quickly find themselves in a hole. The Stifle Tower protects the back line while the Jazz guards get into you, and if you fall asleep on the defensive end, the Jazz will make you pay.Coming out of the all-star break, the Jazz will play half of their remaining 30 games against teams over .500. With the way that the Jazz have been rolling lately (8-2 in their last 10), that bodes well as they come down the home stretch, especially when you consider their season record in light of the missed games by Gobert and Favors. If any of the teams battling it out has a chance to rise even higher than the 6th seed, it just might be the Utah Jazz. PORTLAND TRAILBLAZERSFor the Portland Trailblazers, taking the 8th seed would be a sign that they are recovering more quickly than expected from 2015's mass-exodus. And right now, making the 8th seed just might be in the cards. A few weeks ago I wrote about how the Blazers have been managing to win ugly and win often of late. Often is an understatement. They have won 12 of their last 15 games thanks in large part to a Herculean effort to crash the offensive glass, while simultaneously being the best in the league at snuffing out fast breaks.Blazers fans were right to have hope in young combo-guard CJ McCollum, and Terry Stotts' ability to keep one of Lillard and McCollum on the floor at all times has been great for the continuity of the offense. Al-Farouq Aminu was a sneaky-good signing amidst the free agent drama generated by bigger names, and the future is very bright in Portland.However, the Blazers have a bit of a problem lurking in the shadows as they look to close out the season: 18 of their 28 remaining games are against teams above .500. That's some stiff competition for a young team who wasn't expected to even sniff 40 wins this year. The next ten games will be crucial for Portland, as they play four home games including key matchups against playoff-hopeful Utah and Houston (plus Golden State), before going on a 6-game Eastern Conference road trip where all but one of their opponents are above .500.If Portland can survive that gauntlet, then they will be in prime shape for the home stretch. However, if they are unable to return from the all star break as hungry as they entered it, then they might be one of the unlucky teams on the outside looking in come late April. HOUSTON ROCKETSHouston Houston Houston. From the Western Conference Finals, to the 9th seed after getting their coach fired and putting forth the 5th-worst defense in the league. For the Rockets, getting the 8th seed isn't about hope for the future, or holding onto some former glory; it's about pride. If Houston can't make the playoffs, a lot of players and a lot of front office personnel are going to have to take a long, hard look in the mirror. Sitting below .500 at 55 games into the season, and losing 6 out of 8 heading into the all-star break, they're going to have to do that anyway.At least Houston knows they have a problem. They are still working with an interim head coach, and their level of trade deadline activity indicates they are looking to make improvements. But they have got their work cut out for them as they head into the home stretch.Of the Rockets' 27 remaining games, just 9 are against teams below .500, and they have 15 games on the road. During a particularly difficult stretch from March 11 to April 6, the Rockets will play 14 games (including 3 back-to-backs), only one of which is against a sub-.500 team. The Rockets' lackadaisical effort early in the season cost them games, and now has got them staring down the barrel of a fate that nobody predicted for them: the lottery. But it's not all doom and gloom in Houston. In many ways, this team is similar to the one that surprised people in the playoffs last year. They still have one of the most gifted scorers in the game, and they still have a healthy amount of talent surrounding him. It's not like the Rockets can't beat teams over .500, it's just a matter of whether or not they have the chemistry and effort level to get them over a hump they thought they passed long ago.Maybe the all-star break was just what the Rockets needed to re-focus them on the task at hand. Maybe James Harden will lead by example and show his teammates that with some defensive effort they can turn their season around. If they rip off a couple big wins, maybe Houston will feel like they can make a splash in the playoffs and they'll get their swagger back. Or, maybe they'll fizzle out, play iso ball, and fans will wait to see what Morey has up his sleeve this offseason. ""James, are you guys going to make the playoffs?"" MEMPHIS GRIZZLIESWhen I first started brainstorming about this article, there was no mention of the Memphis Grizzlies. Then Gasol got hurt, but I figured the Grizz had enough talent to fill the void for the time being, and they'd be able to keep themselves confortably in playoff position. Then they traded Courtney Lee for assets with minimal immediate impact. Then they traded Jeff Green. Now, here we are, in the Memphis Grizzlies section.The Grizzlies seem to be headed for a big roster overhaul, ditching a few of their more valuable assets, and with Mike Conley in a contract year. What happens with the rest of this year remains to be seen. Will Lance Stephenson get meaningful minutes and be able to perform? Will Conley ball out as he looks for a big contract? Will Randolph start dropping 25/15 games like he's 27 years old again?With a 5-game buffer, and only two plus-.500 opponents in the next 2+ weeks, the Grizzlies will probably be able to hold on to their spot. But there's no doubt that they're going to miss the presence of Courtney Lee and Jeff Green down the stretch of the season. If a hungry young team like the Blazers catches fire, they could easily snatch the Grizzlies' playoff hopes away. SACRAMENTO KINGS, DENVER NUGGETS, NEW ORLEANS PELICANSThese three teams may have already missed their chance. They're all sitting 4.5-6.5 games out of the playoffs, with the 6-8 seeds playing some fine ball right now, and the 9th place Rockets always a danger to figure something out and turn it on. In order to steal that precious playoff spot, one of these teams is going to have to go on a monster run to close out the season. But any of the Kings, Nuggets, and Pelicans stealing the 8th seed would be considered a huge win after their tough starts. It would show incredible resilience from teams that have been undermanned and/or undercoached, and would no doubt lead to bouts of mass hysteria in the playoff-bound team's market.The Kings have resigned themselves to keep George Karl until the end of the season. They've lost 8 of their last 10, and are playing horrendous defense from both a technical and effort perspective. That being said, they have DeMarcus Cousins who is an absolute game-changer, and Rondo who knows how to facilitate an offense. If the Kings can string a couple wins together, and Rondo and Cousins get a whiff of that 8th seed, there's no telling what could happen. The Kings have about an even split of .500-plus/sub-.500 games, as well as home/road games remaining. That's not quite a recipe for a ""monster run,"" but if the Kings can surprise a couple of the better teams they face, and not lay any eggs against the bad ones, they've got a shot. However, consistency hasn't been a strong point of the Kings so far this season, and Kings fans know not to get their hopes up too high about this team. Hopefully Vlade follows through on hiring a GM, and the Kings can get on the right track (again) this offseason. In the meantime, Kings fans can just watch this on a loop.The Denver Nuggets have looked a little frisky lately, playing .500 ball over their last 20 games. They've had some nice wins against the Raptors, Pistons, and Warriors in that timeframe. If you sleep on this team, they will hurt you. Sitting in the bottom third of the league defensively, the Nuggets have certainly got areas to improve, but they've got guys who play hard, and who know how to put points on the board. Gallo has looked very nice in 2016, averaging 22 points on 36% 3pt shooting. Not laser-accuracy, but Nuggets fans have to be happy to see that he's getting there after his 2014 knee injury.Of the Nuggets' 28 remaining games, 16 are against .500 or better teams It will be an uphill battle for a team that probably can't afford to lose more than about 10 more games if they want to make the playoffs. Interestingly, of the Nuggets' last 9 games, 5 are against teams who will be jockeying with them for playoff position. Unfortunately, the other 4 are against the Clippers, Spurs, Thunder, and Grizzlies. If the Nuggets approach late March with an outside of making it, their fate just might be in their own hands. Don't expect big things, but with some nice young pieces, Nuggets fans have a lot to look forward to.The Pelicans were last year's 8th seed, and hoped to follow it up with a higher finish this season. But the injury gods had other ideas. They got off to a very slow start (1-11) due to a myriad of injuries, and have never been able to string together enough wins to get them closer to .500. Now, 13 games below .500, the Pelicans will need to keep bodies on the court and shore up their defense if they want to get back to the playoffs. With a balanced schedule remaining, it will be tough for them to turn things around mid-season, especially since Anthony Davis has missed a disappointing number of games this year with back and shoulder troubles.Maybe they can pull it off, but ultimately, escaping this season with minimal (further) injuries and then re-evaluating the roster seems like the Pelicans' best route. They made it to the postseason last year, so the playoff berth wouldn't be quite as tantrically-satisfying as it would be for Sacramento or next year's TWolves (or, most likely, next year's Sacramento). MY PICKS TO MAKE THE PLAYOFFS IN THE WEST:5. Utah Jazz6. Memphis Grizzlies7. Houston Rockets8. Dallas MavericksMissing out: Portland Trailblazers, Sacramento Kings, New Orleans Pelicans, Denver Nuggets RACE FOR 8th IN THE EASTLet's assume that the Pacers and Heat have enough of a combination of star power, solid coaching, and veteran leadership to power them into the playoffs. That leaves two playoff spots below them, and a lot of teams looking to fill them up.  CHICAGO BULLSThe Bulls sneaking into the playoffs doesn't bring excitement the their fanbase in the same way that some other teams would. At the start of the season, I would have had Chicago in a ""Race for the 1 seed"" article.But here we are in mid-February, and the Bulls have gone 5-14 in their last 19 games. They've lost 5 in a row, and up next is one of the hottest teams in the league, Toronto. Butler is out for at least a few more weeks, Noah is done for the season, Mirotic is weeks away, Dunleavy still needs time to work himself back into game shape, Hoiberg doesn't quite seem to have things on track... In short, times are hard.But there is hope. Despite missing a few games here and there, Rose is doing his best to recapture what he can of his MVP form. Young bucks like McDermott, Moore, and Portis have shown glimpses, even if they can't always put it together on a night-to-night basis. Taj Gibson could turn it on if he can stay healthy. There are glimmers of hope here and there. And once Butler et al are back in the lineup, there is much more than hope; there is possibility. The Bulls are known Raptor-killers, and from the 7th seed or higher, they could make a deep playoff run.But first, they need to get there. The Bulls play half of their remaining games against sub-.500 teams, which has to be encouraging for them. They also don't face any road trip longer than 3 games, and have an equal number of games at home and on the road. Those are all nice positives to focus on. The negatives are that in 2016, the Bulls are putting out a bottom-10 defense AND a bottom-10 offense. Losing a two-way star like Butler will do that to you, but he's only missed the last couple weeks and the slide was already well under way by that point. If the Bulls can stem the tide, and play .500 ball until Butler comes back, they are almost a lock to hold on to their playoff spot. But if they continue to spiral, Chicago might be forced to re-evaluate their coaching and roster situation while they're watching from the sidelines in April. Hopefully Butler's back soon and we can get some more of this. CHARLOTTE HORNETSMaking the playoffs would be huge for the Hornets, In a season that's seen Jefferson miss a ton of time, it would give them the green light to officially move past him and build around the strong young players they've amassed over the last few years. They're basically at that point already; this would just be the icing on the cake.Everything seemed to be rounding into form following Michael Kidd-Gilchrist's return, as the Hornets ripped off 5 wins in 7 games. But with MKG now out for the season, it looked like Charlotte would be back to grinding out .500 ball. And then this happened.Adding Courtney Lee into the mix certainly makes things interesting. Lee has been shooting well over 40% from deep since December 1st, and while he doesn't quite have the same length or athleticism as MKG, Lee is a high quality 3-and-D guy who can give them another 2-way weapon to help Batum & Co. pick teams apart on both sides of the ball.The road ahead is a little softer than you might expect for the Hornets, with just 12 of their 29 remaining games against teams .500 or better. This should more than make up for a road-heavy schedule that includes a 6-game road trip right out of the gate after the all-star break. Because of this road trip, and the adjustment to Courtney Lee, the Hornets may falter somewhat in the next few games. But look for them to recover nicely, and close out the year strong. The Hornets aren't going to give their playoff spot away. Somebody is going to have to take it. DETROIT PISTONSThe last time the Pistons made the playoffs, Stephen Curry was not in the league, and Lebron James was still on the Cavaliers. I mean...whatever. It's been a while. Making the playoffs would be a huge boost for Detroit's success-starved fans, and the Pistons are in a nice position to get there.Andre Drummond is scoring and rebounding at a tremendous rate. If he could shoot free throws (or depending on how they change the hack-a- rule), he would be a completely unstoppable force. Add to that an elite 3-and-D guy like KCP, a solid starting PG in Jackson, and newly-acquired 3/4 tweener Tobias Harris (and DMo once he's in NBA form again), and this looks like a tough team to even slow down, let alone stop.All that being said, the Pistons are in an tight spot. They're only so-so on either end of the floor (18th on offense, 12th on defense), and they suffer from the lowest ast% in the league this season, meaning the ball is sticking more than it should. While turning Jennings and Ilyasova into Tobias Harris might help those first two numbers, Detroit will need to do a little extra work on the offensive side to get the ball moving more.Coming out of the all-star break, the Pistons will play 15 of their 28 remaining games against .500-plus teams. Looking ahead, there is a very important stretch where they have a whopping 9-game homestand. I had to double check when I first saw it. They then close out the season with a run of games against Eastern Conference opponents including the Cavaliers, Heat (twice), Magic, Bulls, and Wizards. If all of those teams still have playoff hopes/seeding to play for, that will be a gruelling stretch as everyone fights tooth-and-nail to better their postseason odds.The success of the Pistons' season may hinge on how quickly the Pistons can integrate Toby H into their system. A slow process will have the Pistons on the sidelines in the playoffs, but if they can get things moving quickly, Detroit fans will be more than ready when the Pistons make their much-anticipated return to postseason play. WASHINGTON WIZARDSAfter last year's regular season and playoff success, and really only losing the aged Paul Pierce in the offseason, the Wizards were supposed to be better than this. At the start of the season, most Wizards fans would have considered the 8th seed a disappointment. But now, sitting 3 games out of the playoffs, Washingtonians would be thrilled with the team's recovery from a less than stellar first half of the season.The Wizards are in a tough spot. Their offense is mediocre, their defense is worse, and their rebounding rate is dead last. It also doesn't bode well that Washington's net rating is better with Beal off the floor. Heading into the deadline, it felt like the Wizards needed to shake things up, and it doesn't get any more shaken up than adding Markieff Morris into the mix. The Wizards are gambling that Morris can leave his, let's say ""passionate"" ways behind him, and work with Wall & Co. to make a playoff push.But even if Markieff comes in and totally jives with the team, it's still going to be an uphill battle. In their final 30 games, the Wizards will face 17 teams that are over .500, and do not have a homestand that is longer than 2 games. That means relatively little practice time, and a whole lot of travel. Maybe if fabled ""Playoff Wittman"" can make an early appearance, it will make enough of a difference to thrust the Wizards into playoff position. The lineup of Gortat, Morris, Porter, Beal, and Wall has the potential to blow games wide open and give Wizards fans premonitions of upsetting the Cavs or Raptors in the first round. But it will take a lot of discipline, a lot of work, and a little luck to get there. They got off on the right foot against Utah last night, and they'll look to keep it rolling with more elite moves like this from Wall. ORLANDO MAGIC, NEW YORK KNICKSEarly in the season, it looked like both of these teams were going to be duke it out for playoff position. Now it looks like they'll probably miss out altogether. For Knicks fans, making the playoffs would be an absolute thrill. I would fear for the safety of the entire city if Porzingis were to hit a playoff game-winning shot. But as the Knicks round out the season with an interim head coach and a rotation that includes Sasha Vujacic and Jose Calderon, it seems unlikely that they'll be able to make much of a push. Until then, there's always this.The Orlando Magic went 19-11 in November and December, but have done just 4-16 since. This led to their apparent decision to unload some assets at the deadline for players who will hopefully help them (either personally, or through future trades), to get back in the race next year. While the pieces don't all fit quite yet, the core of this team is exciting, and if they can re-capture some of that early season magic (pause for uproarious laughter...now continue), they might give Orlando fans a bit of a thrill down the stretch. However, that thrill will be dampened by the fact that a full 2/3 of Orlando's remaining games are against teams .500 or above. Orlando fans will have to watch this on a loop until next year: MY PICKS TO MAKE THE PLAYOFFS IN THE EAST:7. Charlotte Hornets8. Detroit PistonsMissing out: Chicago Bulls, Washington Wizards, New York Knicks, Orlando Magic Whether sneaking into the playoffs is considered a triumph, a disappointment, or a point of pride, there is no denying that fans of teams heading to the postseason will have a little extra pep in their step. There's just something magical about the big stage, the hope of an upset, and the bubbling energy that sweeps through a city on a playoff run. Maybe drifting into the lottery is the ""right"" thing to do. After all, making the playoffs is no guarantee of future success. This year's Pelicans and Celtics are examples of how wildly different an 8th seed's fate can be the next season. But regardless of your feelings about the Black Eyed Peas or Pitch Perfect, most fans would love to see their team in the 2016 version of this commercial.",http://reddit.com/r/nba/comments/46mee9/c/d0j4stx,1456817893,nba,"[OC] Now that we're past the trade deadline, the race for the 8th seed is officially on!",236,46mee9,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/46mee9,1455840000

280,I will read everything realted to Kobe,1,"Okay this is pure speculation and I expect the down votes, so while I'm going down I decided to add some videosWhen I saw this article about Kobe airballing shots, I decided to look into it to see if it was going to point out what I saw. Of course the article says he's missing these shots because he's past his prime, and I'm not doubting that part. But I'm not entirely sure his body has actually given up on him. I think Kobe doesn't trust his body so he's trying something newI think this because at the beginning of the year I wanted to get better at shooting. I was actually going to post a tip in the appropriate subreddit but decided against it..but what I was going to point out was something I learned from players like KD and to some extent CurryNow if you look here you'll find a video of Durant doing the short hop into his jumper. If you search it online you'll find all the benefits from itHere's a video from 2013 from Bballbreakdown about the hopHere's another video from 2014 about the hop vs 1-2If you just search short hop shooting or something on YouTube, you'll find a ton of videos on it. Here's why the short hop is good:Kobe is famously known as a 2 motion shooter - this is from ShotMechanics. If you know about 2 motion shooting then you know it is a much slower shot and for most people there's not as much power since it's not all happening in one motion. This is something Kobe has been aware of and with people like Kevin Durant making the short hop look fantastic out there, it would only make sense that Kobe adds the short hop into his game, right? And if you go to article talking about how Kobe is airballing 3s, you'll see how he's adding the short hop to his gameBut the short hop isn't the problem. As noted here by Pro Shot Shooting System Kobe Bryant pretty much added the hop into his game back in 2012. But what's important to note here is how Kobe borrowed the move from Kevin Durant in the first place. This is important to my observation2012 was also after the Mavs won the title and Dirk received a ton of recognition for his trademark fadeaway. Shooters saw how dominate he was with this move so they decided to add it to their game. If you think of the top players who immediately added it to their game, you see that they were Durant, Kobe, and MeloNow keep this in mind: Kobe is borrowing and using moves of Dirk, Durant, and all the other legends before...and we can see all of this in the 2011-2012 and 2012-2013 season. Kobe is having success with these moves. But then what happens?In 2013 Kobe goes down with the achilles injury, right? We say he's never going to be the same, and right now it looks that way. The article talking about how he's airballing 3s makes it seem that way as well. But there's something just way different with his shooting now than before...Since his injury there's been one great shooter who's popped up. We all know who this is. It's Steph Curry. Now, Kobe is the kind of guy who'll see a great move from a player and just take it because he knows it'll make him better. Kobe took the short hop from Durant and the fadeaway from Jordan and Dirk...and a ton of other moves from other players. So what is it that Curry has that Kobe doesn't?Curry has a faster release than Kobe. Kobe is a 2 motion shooter while Curry is a well known One motion shooter. His shooting is all one motion. If you're skimming around then just come to this spot, and then read what you skipped overI think Kobe is struggling with his shot because he's trying to shoot more like a one motion shooter like Steph Curry. Go to this article on Kobe airballing shot and watch how Kobe is shooting the ball. Compare that to Kobe back before his injury in this video on him shooting nothing but 3sIn the video before his injury you see how Kobe pauses before actually releasing his shot. This is the two motion shooting. But in the article they pulled clips of him not doing it as much. It's hard to explain unless you look at it, but it makes a world of difference. Going from a two motion shot to a one motion shot isn't that bad if you're just at home practicing, because you don't have that many variables to through you off. But pulling that off in game is very difficult because Kobe holding the ball longer in his two motion shooting helps him aim. If you go from a two motion shot to a one motion shot at game speed, that's the equivalent of just chucking the ball up and hoping you make it. That's why Kobe is airballing and missing what were once easy shots.The key is to look at how Kobe is missing and not just the fact that he's missing and I strongly believe that the how he is missing can be attributed to the fact that he's trying to borrow one motion shooting from Curry. I also don't think it has much to do with his age and legs because Kobe isn't just missing shots because they're short..he's completely missing the rim. Age doesn't do that to you. Not when you practice as much as he does, because if age was an issue, then he'd more than likely come up short more than overthrow the shot. But since one motion shooting can extend your range by giving you more power, it makes sense that he's overthrowingMore miscellaneous proof If you look at the last video in the article talking about him airballing, you see him go for a quick release. Signs of quick releasing in most players is how they don't hold their follow through, but they don't hold their follow through all the time. It's not situational, so it's not like they drop their arms off the dribble. But here, Kobe is a standstill and he's not holding his follow through. In that 3 point shooting compilation I linked in here, you see him holding his follow through way more often than not. So why is he not doing it in 2015?Also, Kobe, imo, has a low arcing shot. [This was mentioned on this subreddit last] year(https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/2jsr0y/kobes_shot_form/), but this guy is saying it just now looks low. To me it's always looked kind of low. You can't really notice it because of the camera angles and shooting 3s, but when he shoots 2s, it looks really low. It could also be because of the fact that he's a 2-motion shooter which requires you to jump higher to put the ball in...you don't need as much arc for that while shooting wide open shots (especially when you're 6'6""Also just watch this video in general to see how Kobe has a true two motion shot in 2011 and here is slow motion on his shot.tl;dr Kobe is a traditional 2-motion shooter and the reason he's shooting poorly now is because he's trying to ""borrow"" another great move to his game: 1-motion shooting (from Curry)",http://reddit.com/r/nba/comments/3rjr7t/c/d17l35x,1458540320,nba,I think I know why Kobe is shooting so bad,4367,3rjr7t,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/3rjr7t,1446595200

303,Was waiting and waiting for OKCs. Now I guess I'll never know. :(,1,"Part four of a six part series. If you'd like to read earlier entries, click the links below:Part One, (which includes a brief overview of On/Off and my criteria for making a selection).Part Two.Part Three.Goran Dragic underachieves, helps the team (NRtg of 2.8); Dwyane Wade overachieves, hurts the team (-1.4)One of these guys is averaging 12/3/5 on 53% TS%, the other is averaging 19/4/5 on 51% TS%. One of them is an expiring contract, while the other is owed north of $70 million over the next four years. Ages aside, Goran’s near-max contract is already looking like a bit of a stinker less than a year after it was signed.So what's really going on here?Remember all the buzz back in the 2013-14 season about Goran’s performance with versus without sharpshooter Channing Frye? Dragic’s effectiveness is largely predicated on the amount of spacing those around him can give him. Unfortunately for him, outside of Chris Bosh and Luol Deng, the Heat have absolutely no outside shooting. And by “absolutely no shooting,” I mean “they have only three other players shooting above 26% from three (Beno Udrih, Dragic, and Gerald Green are shooting 33.3%, 33.1%, and 31.9% respectively).”So despite scoring at a historic rate and efficiency for a 34-year old shooting guard, Wade is unable to provide the exterior pressure that his point guards so desperately requires of him. I’m actually largely inclined to believe that this might not be Wade’s fault either. After having his entire left meniscus removed in 2002, Dwyane has largely been a warrior when it comes to making the best of a bad situation throughout his entire career, so it’s tough to fault him for not putting in the long hours in the summer to work on his jumper.Still, the prove is in the pudding. Dragic and Wade have combined for a pedestrian 0.2 NRtg when sharing the floor together, but that shoots up to 11.4 when Goran plays without Dwyane. This is a problem because as two of the Heat’s most important important players, they play 73.5% of their minutes together. These three-man lineups illustrate what happens when the Heat are able to put even the tiniest bit of spacing around Goran:SourceThis will make for an interesting decision for the Heat this summer. Wade has twice left money on the table when re-signing with the Heat, but last June Pat Riley might have overplayed his hand when he offered the face of his franchise $10 million less than his asking price. They eventually worked it out with a one year, $20 million dollar deal, but it wouldn’t be the craziest thing to see Wade wearing a different jersey this time next year, especially if he continues not to mesh well with both Goran and Chris Bosh (Bosh has -1.4 NRtg with Wade, 6.4 withoutO.J. Mayo: SaviorThe might be the happiest moment of /u/OverEmotionalCavsFan and all of /r/MayoStories lives. O.J. Mayo is currently leading the Bucks with a -1.1 NRtg (team average is -4.8), and second only to John Henson in DRtg. Remember when Jaylen Rose called Mayo a “stretch guard”? Well Jaylen, this is what real defense looks like!So what's really going on here?As I proved when tackling why the Mavericks’ AST/TO tanks when Deron Williams is on the court in Part One, I am not above admitting when I have no idea what’s going on.And I have no idea what’s going on here.Don’t get me wrong, Mayo appears to be in better shape this year and he’s in a contract year. But it’s not like he’s playing better than last year, he actually seems to be playing much, much worse, only shooting 37.1% from the field, and 28.9% from three. He only plays 38.5% of his minutes with Henson, so that’s obviously not artificially deflating his DRtg drastically.The only thing that I noticed is that opposing teams notch assists at their second worst rate for all Buck players when Mayo is on defense. So maybe opponent shooting guards are attempting to pull a Dak just at the sight of Mayo..?As an aside, I thank my lucky stars everyday that /r/NBA wasn’t a thing in 2008, because 14-year old /u/JMGill12 would’ve had some stern words for GM Kevin McHale after he traded away the next Michael Jordan for a chubby, white kid who was one Seventeen magazine’s “17 Hottest Hunks Under Age 21.” Though the internet appears to be almost wiped clean of the evidence that photoshoot ever happened, I was able to confirm it from an old AP story and I didn’t just imagine the whole thing. Also, yes, I did read my sister’s old Seventeen magazines. I wanted to be a better kisser, ok?Zach LaVine is not a point guardI just can’t anymore. I can’t type another full argument about why LaVine should only play shooting guard, especially when it’s so obvious to anybody who has watched the Wolves at all this season, even for a single game.So what's really going on here?Absolutely nothing has changed since I wrote this article on this exact topic for Nylon Calculus in October.It’s just frustrating to see a team so blatantly disregard one of their prospect’s strengths, and largely put him in a position not to succeed. There’s a night and day difference between when LaVine plays with Ricky Rubio (NRtg of -0.9) versus when he doesn’t (-9.4)—and that’s with Zach struggling from three for some unexplained reason when they share the court. Yet they’ve only played logged 300 minutes together so far this season, but at least that’s more than the 36 minutes they logged last season (not a typo, even after Rubio returned from injury they never played together).In a nutshell, what’s the difference for Zach between playing with Rubio or without him? Well, playing with Rubio he takes 27.1% less of his field goals from midrange, and 19% more of them at the rim.But nah, that’s just making things too easy, I guess.Omer Asik does nothing for Anthony Davis defenseThe numbers:My defense! The Asik does nothing!So what's really going on here?The league is changing, that’s what’s happening here.Asik isn’t a bad defensive player, in fact his contest rate around the rim (37.1%) is still well above average for centers and comparable to Rudy Gobert’s (37.3%). Opposing players are only shooting 46.7% against his contests, and he’s 9th in the league among centers when it comes to deterring shots at the rim (only 14.8 attempted per 36). Omer Asik is still really good at the skill he hangs his hat on. All stats via Nylon Calculus.Though his main problems are on offense where he has the lowest ORtg on the team (98.8), there’s no use beating that dead horse; He doesn’t finish well through traffic, provides no spacing, and is shaky from the line—but these were a known issues when he arrived in New Orleans two summers ago.The league has really just passed the Pelicans by—or rather the Pelicans we see on the floor on a given night due to injuries. A Holiday-Gordon-Evans-Anderson-Davis lineup has the makings of small-ball gold, but far too often the Pelicans have had to run lineups with Dante Cunningham playing small forward. Other teams love going small against New Orleans, and coach Alvin Gentry responses by playing Anthony Davis at center, which allows the defense to be held down by another rim protector in Asik’s absence.The Holiday-Gordon-Evans-Davis-Asik lineup played only 13 minutes this whole season together, so Asik might regain his value at the point the Pelicans regain their health. But, it’s tough to tell what role a limited rim protector will have in the league over the duration of the four years, and $47 million, Asik has left on his contract.Derrick Williams is proving, once again, that he’s still Derrick WilliamsFormer number two overall pick Derrick Williams, or better know as “La Mirada Mirage,” landed in the Big Apple this summer in the Big Apple to reserved optimism from Knicks fans. But it’s going great, right Knicks fans? Everything’s totally going great, right?Because what are the chances that he was just teasing his team’s fan base with a great opening two weeks, and then disappears until February? Right, Wolves fans? Right Kings fans..?So what's really going on here?It’s kind of unfair to point out that he has the worst Off NRtg on the team (-0.3), because it almost mirrors Carmelo’s On NRtg (0.5). When Melo comes out, DWill is often the one replacing him.Regardless Derrick Williams remains one of the the worst players on the Knicks. His NRtg of -6.7 is third-worst on the team behind Kevin Seraphin (-12.0) and Sasha Vujacic (-7.0). He’s taking over 4 shots from deep every 36 minutes, despite shooting a league-worst 22.5% among players shooting at that rate. His defense remains uninspired—and when not uninspired, just plain bad.The good news is that Phil Jackson nailed pretty much every off-season acquisition outside of Williams, who was a flier to begin with. While Derrick will entice with his occasion offensive explosion, and weekly dunk that allows you to dream about what could be, it’s time to admit this one didn’t pan out—for any of the three teams that took a chance on him.",http://reddit.com/r/nba/comments/45g7ot/c/d0ivn72,1456799538,nba,"[OC] 30 Teams, 30 Statistical Anomalies [Part Four]",33,45g7ot,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/45g7ot,1455235200

328,"**TL;DR  I was wrong about Cristiano Felicio and Justin Holiday joining the Bulls and being able to contribute meaningful minutes**

I was wrong about two Bulls related roster moves this year.  For the life of me I could not understand why the Bulls were so quick to sign a guaranteed deal for Cristiano Felicio (a guy nobody had ever heard of before) to play center on a team with a glut at that position (Gasol, Noah, and Bairstow already signed) as it gave the Bulls 15 guaranteed roster spots preventing them from making any pickups this season.

The guy actually looked decent in the minutes he's played.  He may never be a starter in this league, but for a few million a year he's a serviceable back up center who moves better than you would think when you look at him and has a good eye for the floor.

More recently I was wrong about Justin Holiday.  I thought he was purely a salary dump by the Bulls in trading Cap'n Kirk away for a guy cut by the Sixers in 2013, but he's looked surprisingly good and even started a game recently for the injury plagued Bulls.  His activity on defense is excellent and his quick decision making on offense has been a welcome change from Tony Snell's (the man he's basically replaced) ball stopping.",1,,http://reddit.com/r/nba/comments/4adj4d/c/d0zevzu,1457969676,nba,"""I was wrong about...""",1,4adj4d,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/4adj4d,1457913600

388,"&gt;“The last five games, the ball moved,” Stan Van Gundy said. “We’ve been much better sharing the ball. They know – they’ve talked about it more than I have – when the ball is moving, you create good feelings and energy and guys want to play. When it’s stagnant and you’re standing around, watching guys go one on one, it’s no fun. It’s frustrating and you don’t really have the desire to compete the way you do when the ball is moving and everybody’s involved in the game.”

&gt;It perhaps isn’t a universal formula for success. Teams that feature dominant one-on-one scorers might have less ball movement and more isolations. But is it critical for the way the Pistons are built?

481,"&gt;**Abstract**

&gt;Tactile communication, or physical touch, promotes cooperation between people, communicates distinct emotions, soothes in times of stress, and is used to make inferences of warmth and trust. Based on this conceptual analysis, we predicted that in group competition, physical touch would predict increases in both individual and group performance. In an ethological study, we coded the touch behavior of players from the National Basketball Association (NBA) during the 2008–2009 regular season. Consistent with hypotheses, early season touch predicted greater performance for individuals as well as teams later in the season. Additional analyses confirmed that touch predicted improved performance even after accounting for player status, preseason expectations, and early season performance. Moreover, coded cooperative behaviors between teammates explained the association between touch and team performance. Discussion focused on the contributions touch makes to cooperative groups and the potential implications for other group settings.

523,"We start every season with expert predictions. Media outlets, as well as various Las Vegas sportsbooks, post their projections of who'll be MVP, which teams will capture division crowns and, of course, who will represent the conferences in the Finals. If you haven't already seen ESPN's projections for who will win the East, here's a gander:

 
That's right, yours truly is the lone outlier, picking the Miami Heat to represent the East. Many factors have led me to this conclusion, not the least of which are the extreme health issues facing the prohibitive favorite Cleveland Cavaliers. However, here I'll focus on why the Heat have a good chance if they can do one thing -- reduce Dwyane Wade's role offensively.

In many ways, Wade has become the Kobe Bryant of the Eastern Conference. He's an over-the-hill star player who hasn't quite accepted a role that doesn't make him the focal point of the offense. Unlike Bryant, however, Wade has experience in taking a step back.

For the Heat to truly unlock their full offensive potential, Wade has to go back to the off-ball cutting role he perfected during the Big Three era, when he redefined how we think of spacing with his ""ghost cuts.""

Pushing the pace

Heat head coach Erik Spoelstra has stated on multiple occasions his desire for his team to play with more pace, and with good reason. Miami was the second-slowest team in the league last season, according to NBA.com, averaging a hair over 93 possessions per game. That's including the second half of the season, when Goran Dragic pushed the team to about 95 possessions per game. Before Dragic's arrival, Miami was dead last at 91.9 possessions per game, with an offensive efficiency of 101.5, which put the Heat near the bottom third of the league. As a result, the Heat were in the bottom third in generating transition opportunities, with less than 12 percent of their offense coming on such plays, according to Synergy Sports.

2015-16 Forecast: Miami Heat
How will the Miami Heat fare in 2015-16? Here's our projection.

Haberstroh: 2015-16 Heat player profiles
Check out our player scouting reports and 2015-16 projections for the Miami Heat.
And it's not just transition plays that are affected by slow pace; it simply leads to overall offensive stagnation. Spoelstra has intimated as much, telling the Miami Herald, ""This team has to get the ball up the floor, get into our actions with decisiveness, clarity and pace. ... It will benefit us to play with pace, to get our players to our strengths. Playing with a slower, methodical pace probably doesn't do that as efficiently.""

The main issue for Miami: Wade is one of the significant ball-stoppers for the team, with more than 20 percent of his touches extending past six seconds, according to SportVu. While usage jumped from the second-lowest level of his career, 27.6 percent, in 2013-14 to the second-highest, 34.5 percent, in 2014-15, Wade's offensive efficiency dropped from 0.995 points per possession to 0.915. He also got fewer opportunities in transition, dropping from 14.9 percent of the offense to 11.9 percent, and increased his shares of isolations, post-ups and pick-and-roll ballhandling. He also had half as many plays classified as cuts, despite being in the 94th percentile in that category the year before.

The goal with Wade should be simple: Get him into the offense with pace and try to avoid the sort of stagnant sets that have him holding and waiting.


FOX
Spacing is an absolute necessity in today's game, but the way we think about spacing can be stretched by creative play-calling. In the play above (which is reminiscent of the ""Elbow Weak"" play we used to run in Phoenix), Dragic has hit Bosh in the high post before going to set a pin-down screen on the weak side for Wade, who comes off the double stagger to catch up top. Although Wade opts for the pull-up midrange jumper, a tighter curl would get him attacking the basket where weakside defense has to make a tough decision on two shooters: Bosh on the fade to the wing and Deng in the right corner, where he shot 47 percent last season. By loading the shooting to the same side and then bringing the action there, the Heat get good enough spacing -- if Wade acts decisively.


ESPN
Here, Miami goes into a simple Horns set with Bosh and Amar'e Stoudemire at the elbows and Wade and Deng in the corners. As Dragic comes off the Stoudemire screen, the defender, Marcin Gortat, sags to quell dribble penetration while a help defender, Kris Humphries, sags to pick up the roll, leaving Bosh to pop back with more than 8 feet of daylight. Again, Deng in the weak corner is a threat, while Wade is a cutting threat from the strong corner should his man try to help on the play. Note the interchangeability of this set: You can substitute Hassan Whiteside, or to a much lesser extent Chris Andersen, for Stoudemire as the roll man; Stoudemire or Josh McRoberts for Bosh; and Mario Chalmers or Gerald Green for Deng.


FOX
Sometimes the simplest plays can be most effective, especially when they buck conventional wisdom. Here, in a bit of role reversal, Wade acts as a ""big"" with a snug pin-down for Bosh, who catches up top. As Wade slips, Bosh has the option of taking the uncontested jumper, hitting the slipping Wade, dumping to Stoudemire in the short corner area or finding weakside shooters. It all depends on what the help defense does.


This offensive set is designed to get Wade on the move, but he's got to show better recognition. After the dribble handoff into the pick-and-roll, Wade attacks before Whiteside is set, rejecting the screen to go into the teeth of the help defense, which hasn't yet made the decision to stay home in the corner. As he penetrates, he misses Deng coming up the weakside wing and Bosh in the weak corner. These nuances almost can seem like nitpicking, but without the type of traditional 3-point spacing on this roster, the Heat's attention to detail will have to heighten because they have a smaller margin for error.


Overall, the increased pace and tempo of the offense can alleviate the relative lack of shooting on the Miami roster. By keeping the individual parts moving, it makes it more difficult for help defenders to pick their poison: whether to stay home on their man or leave to help on the primary action.

In order for this to work, however, Wade has to make a concerted effort to be effective on the run rather than play methodically. As he grows more familiar with the newer faces on the roster, he'll have a better feel for where the release-valve passes are in situations.

In many ways, that's a metaphor for where he is in his career. Once able to quick-twitch react to defensive moves, he now has to anticipate what the defense will do and have several possible reactions mapped out. If he's able, and willing, to make this adjustment, the Heat have a chance to turn some heads next spring.

If so, what software do you use to record the games?What I typically do is watch games on my iPad (I have a Slingbox) and have my computer open at the same time. I am a contributor to a start-up sports app (Overtime) which relies on video from sporting events. Sometimes I want to capture a moment but I can not rewind during a broadcast (the Slingbox is connected to a receiver that does not have a DVR, and using DVR on Slingbox is a bitch). Right now the only things I record are replays, and that is done with my phone. The quality of them are kind of shitty (not like the typical streamable video as the recording is done on my phone) and I would like to increase my quality. Is there a service that can record what I am watching on my iPad that will send the content to my computer from which I can cut up and develop a video of my desired content?

I'm not a *stathead*, but the 1st google search result for *nba technical fouls* would give you that easily accessible information. No digging through advanced metrics to find basic information. Hard data should be used when making an assessment rather than solely relying on the eye test. Net positive was meant to convey that yes, Draymond's fire fuels the team.  I agree with you, but if you understood my arguments he needs to check his emotions before it becomes a problem.

Can you comprehend why Draymond apologized to his team today? Did you hear the expanded reports of the incident? Would it have been Ok with you if that outburst was by Marreese Speights? Dray realized that he was out of line and will learn from the experience. 

And maybe you can too.

733,"He comes from another world. Give him some time and he will grow even bigger, but will not lose all of his other talents, nor his agility. He will rule them all, mark my words.",1,"After Nikola Jokic went off for 27pts and 14rbs last night against a surging Raptors team, Nuggets coach Mike Malone asserted ""I mean you can talk about some of these very young bigs who are very talented, the kid in New York, Minnesota, Philly, I don't know any of their names. I know this kid's name, though. I know Nikola Jokic and I wouldn't trade him for anybody in the world.” Wait, hold up!Nikola Jokic is clearly the most obscure rookie mentioned by Malone to the common fan. How could one back-up such a brave statement on the relatively unknown rookie big? From pure common sense, it is quite clear why Jokic is not generally held in contention with other rookies such as Karl-Anthony Towns and Jahlil Okafor. Jokic was originally picked in the 2nd round of the 2014 draft and stashed overseas for the 2014-2015 NBA season. Beyond coming from a foreign land without the mystique which brought Kristaps Porzingis his initial fame, Jokic landed on a team in Denver which originally appeared on the onset of a massive rebuild. Jokic also fell behind a surging Jusef Nurkic, who appeared to be the franchise's key piece heading into this supposed rebuild. All in all, the odds fell against Nikola coming into the 2015-2016 season.In the end, this just makes Jokic's story that much more interesting. Jusef Nurkic, Denver's prime prospect coming into this season, began the season recovering from surgery to repair partially torn left patellar tendon. This opening gave Jokic an opportunity to prove himself.Now, in February, Jokic is leading the more prominent rookie bigs in eFG%, Offensive Rating(according to Basketball References' metric), and falls behind only Karl-Anthony Towns in Offensive Win Shares. Jokic's offensive game is already quite developed. With an above average finishing ability, shooting 64% from around the rim, the Nuggets do not lose any raw power around the rim when Jokic plays in front of Nurkic. To put this in perspective, Jahlil Okafor is only .1% better around the rim than Nikola.Where Nikola truly shines though is his ability to fade off of screens and pop either a 3 or a mid-range jumper. Jokic's 3pt% on the season falls at 35.3% which compares favorable with fellow European rookie big Kristaps Porzingis's own 34.2%. Jokic is also a more accomplished midrange shooter than Porzingis, though Porzingis has become the European rookie sensation.The only place where tends to struggle is defensively, though he does not truly fall far from other rookie bigs. Only Willie Cauley-Stein falls ahead of Nikola in Defensive Box Plus-Minus, which is most interesting because Jokic has not played a majority of his minutes with the starting lineup. Even when compared to Nurkic, Jokic only falls behind by 1 point in Defensive Rating. Nokic has the size and the reach to be a solid defender in the NBA, which completes the whole package of offensive versatility and defensive prowess.In the end, it is too hard to state whether Jokic will ever be the better player than the other prime rookie bigs, but it is clear that Nikola Jokic's name will be an above average center on a much cheaper contract than the other prominent rookie bigs in the league.

Watch this close up of [Steph Curry shooting.](https://youtu.be/PtihObdHd5Q?t=11s) He is able to get the pall off of his palm and onto his finger tips almost instantly because of kinetic motion in his wrist. 

The real benefit to letting the ball rest on your palm is the comfort/versatility is grants you, IE, when you're in a game, doing gamespeed things, you will probably not have enough time to create daylight between the ball and your hand. Some shooters like Klay [combat this by bending their wrist backwards so much that they let the ball rest on their finger tips before they go forward,](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-yOxWNqWUGA0/VN-c_Ur_CAI/AAAAAAAAT7s/L9YrSgCaazY/s1600/Klay-Thompson-Shooting-Touch-2.png) where as [Curry keeps his wrist essentially locked and curved](http://images.techtimes.com/data/images/full/90427/stephen-curry.jpg?w=600) (not bent as much as you'll find in other shooters) and allows the motion of his shot to put the ball on his finger tips.",2,"While watching videos on Steph Curry's form, I noticed a video claim and seemingly prove that when shooting Curry rests the ball on his palm and not on his finger tips.https://youtu.be/_anxl_hE9jQ?t=5m41sI thought that was weird considering it is one of the first things I was taught to avoid when shooting. I then saw this video where Curry teaches people to shoot off of their finger tips.https://youtu.be/olnkP06SHyY?t=43sI guess my question is, does Curry shoot off his palm against typical basketball advice? If so, how can anyone continue to teach that palm shooting is bad, if the best shooter of all time is a palm shooter?EDIT:
Thanks for the input everyone. What I want to address is, does palm shooting add some benefit to your shot if it doesn't hurt your control? From what I can tell maybe palm shooting allows for more backspin on the ball that fingertip shooting would not provide. The intense backspin of Curry's shot may help with his insane percentage from deep 3.If all of the greats have their own nuances, should shot coaching at lower levels be less black and white?

899,fewer players care about defense + tired + injured + money grubbin hoes,3,"Hey r/nba,I was looking at the posted in another post, and I couldn't help but notice that the defensive ratings appeared to go up for nearly every team.  I'd scraped some game totals going back to 1968 (when the season was extended to 82 games), and I looked at the average point total by game number (see below for how I defined ""game number"").As you can see in this graph, point totals appear to go up as the season increases.  I've never seen this before, are there explanations?  I did some thinking, and I considered the following:Players are tired.  I think it's a given that as player effort wanes, point totals increase (ex: All-Star games).  As the season ends and the playoff stakes get clearer, maybe the effort level decreases?Offense = chemistry/technique vs Defense is athleticism:  I don't mean to discount the importance of technique for defenses; after all, the success of the 2016 Spurs or Thibodeau Bulls isn't solely athleticism; their's definitely an element of practice and chemistry there.  However, offense is increasingly about good passing and good shot selection, and I imagine it takes time to develop the team chemistry needed to get those shots.  As teams adjust to new rosters and personnel at the beginning of the season, maybe it takes longer to get the offenses going vs the defenses?Stat padding: as the season ends and free agency approaches, maybe players are speeding up the games (and those point totals) to strengthen their stats for contract negotiations?I don't know, but I was wondering if this was a known phenomenon and if anybody wanted to discuss.  Super interested in hearing your ideas!Side note: for ""game number"", I defined that as the average of the two teams.  So for example, if the Warriors are playing the Spurs at home, and it's the Warriors 54th game and the Spurs 56th game, then game number would be 55.",http://reddit.com/r/nba/comments/4bz4a1/c/d1dp934,1458954246,nba,Why do game point totals increase as the season progresses?,20,4bz4a1,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/4bz4a1,1458950400

914,"I'd argue that in a playoff setting my statement would be correct. When you can target all your mental resources around defending a standard high pick and roll, it's much easier to target than an option based offense ",1,"The play that will be analyzed can be seen here.  The play starts with Livingston as the primary ball handler while the remaining four players align in “Floppy” or “Single-Double” formation. It’s referred to as “Single-Double” because Thompson has the choice between choosing the double, staggered screen from Rush and Barnes, or he can opt for the single screen from Varejao.  Diagram 1    After Klay chooses to use the single screen and pop to the right wing, Livingston hits him with a pass. Since this action is so common within the NBA, a good look generally is not generated just yet. Klay then dishes the ball to Varejao in the post, which triggers the “Split Cut” action. Varejao is not getting the ball in the post as a signal to try and score one-on-one, rather, he has the ball in the post to facilitate the offense.  Diagram 2From here, Varejao hit Klay off the split cut to flow into the next part of the offense, as even this did not generate a good enough look to throw up a shot. 
The next sequence has Varejao step up to Thompson to set a high ball screen while Livingston spaces out to the corner. By properly spacing the floor after several offensive sequences have occurred, the Warriors have ensured that the Knicks are not comfortably in defensive position. Thompson draws two defenders (Seraphin, dropping back, and Galloway, trailing on his hip) and as a result, Varejao is able to roll to the rim without a defender. To combat this, Porzingis will sag into the lane and “tag” the roll man, which leaves his assignment, Barnes, open. Diagram 3  As a result, when Varejao receives the pass from Thompson, he now has a clear option to pass to the unguarded wing player. Barnes does a good job of dropping towards Rush’s man and setting a “flare screen” so the rotation will be harder for Afflalo,, leaving Rush open for three. Varejao will hit Rush for the three-pointer after he makes a superfluous drive that goes nowhere.",http://reddit.com/r/nba/comments/4clvp0/c/d1jdgyi,1459362088,nba,Analyzing a Warriors offensive sequence,7,4clvp0,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/4clvp0,1459296000

969,"http://theringer.com/ works just fine, just fyi",0,"The Five Reasons Why the Spurs Had to Beat the Warriors
By Jason ConcepcionIt is Year 19 of the Duncapopolithic age, and the Spurs are flirting with 70 wins. They are posting a historic net rating (13.4). They have assembled their best defensive team since 2003-04 — a mobile, physical, in-your-face Voltron, anchored by gray-bearded Tim Duncan’s rim fortress. They have the stoic synthetic human Kawhi Leonard and not-shooting-well-but-doing-everything-else-well Danny Green. And still they are three games behind the Golden State Starkiller Base in the Western Conference, and likely won’t have Game 7 of the conference finals on their home court (where they are undefeated).In any other season, the Spurs would be runaway title favorites.This, however, is the season of Steph Curry, who has officially reached “for the children” status. In the first clash between these titans, back in January, Steph stood next to the mountain and chopped it down with the edge of his hand: 37 points on 12-of-20 shooting (including 6-of-9 from 3), plus five steals for good measure. When, during that game, Pop fulfilled the fantasies of basketball nerds everywhere by aiming the Kawhi-bot at him, Curry entered bullet time and put Leonard on a Vine. True, Duncan missed the game with knee-related oldness, but that was little comfort, considering the 120-90 scale of the demolition.On Saturday night, Golden State came into the AT&T Center (where they had not won in the regular season since 1997) on the second night of a back-to-back and down two key players (Andrew Bogut and Andre Iguodala, a card-carrying Lineup du Mort).If the Spurs couldn’t have beaten the Warriors under those circumstances, it would’ve been fair to wonder if they ever could.Drastic times call for drastic measures. Aldridge looked out of sorts in the first meeting, scoring only five points on 2-of-9 shooting, with a plus-minus of minus-20. Since deleting his Twitter and Instagram accounts, Aldridge’s scoring average has increased from just over 15 points per game to 22. If someone makes a “Never Tweet” Aldridge T-shirt, I will buy it.Gregg Popovich is often referred to as a chess player. But in my mind, the best game-of-skill metaphor is Hearthstone. He understands which cards to play early and which to play late, how to force his tempo on an opponent, and how to effectively use his mana. I don’t even care whether you understand that reference. The point is, Pop used his best deck for this game. He pulled Tim Duncan from the starting lineup for Boris Diaw (last time Duncan came off the bench at home: March 18, 2004) and went small. Well, small in a sense. The Diaw-Aldridge frontcourt may be short on 7-footers, but in terms of B2H (butt-to-height ratio) they are dominant. All that rear (and the absence of Bogut) helped the Spurs clear acres of space under the glass and rack up a 53-37 rebounding advantage. Here’s me looking at Pop’s small-ball lineup:Pop kept human victory ogre Boban Marjanovic (13 minutes in the first game) out of sight; there was no Professor Andre Miller; there was barely any of Professor Andre Miller’s Looper, Kyle Anderson (16 minutes on January 25); and Kevin Martin played the same amount of time it takes to microwave a bag of popcorn. Pop was serious.Only eight minutes of floor time! The Spurs dare not waste his sacrifice.",http://reddit.com/r/nba/comments/4bemqw/c/d18p6po,1458614743,nba,[The Ringer Newsletter] Jason Concepcion on Why the Spurs had to beat the Warriors,18,4bemqw,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/4bemqw,1458518400

In the history of the NBA only 7 teams have ever eclipsed a +10 point differential. Three of these teams were the 1990's Bulls. And, three of them occurred in 1970-71 and 1971-72, right after the NBA added 8 expansion teams in 5 years, thereby diluting the average NBA talent level and providing 8 relatively weak teams. Unless the Spurs and Warriors shit the bed, they will both join this list this season. The Thunder are a ways back at 7.6. But, since the 1999-2000 season, the Thunder's 7.6 per game point differential would have either been the best in the NBA or within 0.2 of the best in the NBA 9 times. They still count as one of the best teams in the last 15 years, according to point-differential at least, and they are only the third best team in their conference. We aren't just watching Curry smash the best PER rating of all time (Wilt's 31.82), and we aren't just watching the Warriors push for the best record in NBA history. We are also watching 2 of the best teams in NBA history play in the same conference as a team that would be in the running for the best in the NBA most seasons. Enjoy the show.

1157,"It certainly seems like the casual fan is getting smarter about scoring efficiency though, and in dedicated basketball forums like /r/nba, everyone seems to understand the 'emptiness' of certain players numbers.

In regards to MCW, most non-casual basketball fans understood his scoring volume was the result of shot volume and high USG%. At the same time, having that high a USG% at a high MPG as a rookie is commendable. 

I also think you should be looking at TS%, not eFG%. TS% is more representative of a players scoring efficiency. Kemba Walker, for example has a slighly below average eFG, but has an above average TS%. 

",3,"Basketball is about getting buckets. It’s simple. You need to get more points than the other team. We love players who can score. We’ll all remember Allen Iverson, Tracy McGrady, and Carmelo Anthony, but only die-hard NBA fans will remember Ben Wallace, Bruce Bowen, or Joakim Noah. Scoring is why we watch. We want to see Kyrie Irving shred through a defense and lay it in. We love it when LeBron gets a fastbreak dunk. We can’t get enough of Steph Curry’s step-back three.Some players are so skilled that it seems they don’t even have to try. Dirk Nowitzki. Kobe Bryant. Kevin Durant. For the better part of two decades, one of those players has been Jamal Crawford. He’s one of the only players that teams feel comfortable giving the ball with 15 seconds, down one. You’re never surprised if you look up a box score and see that Crawford dropped 30, 40, 50 points.However, it’s equally unsurprising to see Crawford make 4 of 20 shots. He may shoot 1 of 10 from three. You’d be more surprised to see he had 0 turnovers than 10. Jamal Crawford is one of the last remnants of the early 2000’s isolation-heavy offense, and epitomizes one of the largest disconnects between basketball and its fans.Your casual NBA fan only looks at a few different stats. Points per game, rebounds per game, assists, blocks, steals, but rarely do those give an accurate measure of a player’s true ability or worth to a team. Every team is going to get their points, regardless of how pretty the process may be. Even the 09-10 Nets scored 92.4 ppg. Someone had to put the ball through the hoop 30-45 times in order to get there, but, chances are, that person didn’t do it very efficiently. Average to above average players, placed on bad teams, are going to have exaggerated scoring outputs at low efficiency. The average fan won’t notice the low efficiency, just the raw scoring output measured in points per game, and these players will be labeled stars. They’ll see the highlight plays coupled with the box scores and salivate over a player’s ability. I like to call this phenomena the Jamal Crawford effect.Crawford is by no means a bad player. In fact, I’d say he’s above average, but he was never a player who should have been taking 15 to 18 shots per game. During the 07-08 season, Crawford averaged 17.4 shots per game, but his effective field goal percentage (eFG%) was .473, which comes close to his career average of .476. That’s a remarkably unremarkable eFG% for a player using so many of his team’s shots, yet it was a season in which Crawford scored 20.6 ppg for the 23-59 Knicks and cemented himself as an “elite” offensive weapon in the eyes of the average NBA fan.You might be saying, “therobsorensen, that doesn’t happen anymore. We’re smarter than we were ten years ago,” but you’d be wrong. Every season there are a handful of players that benefit from the Jamal Crawford effect. The most glaringly obvious example is Michael Carter-Williams.During the 13-14 season, MCW scored 16.7 ppg for the 19-63 76ers. He won Rookie of the Year and was dubbed one of the rising stars in the NBA. At the following season’s trade deadline, fans unabashedly praised the Buck’s decision to swap Brandon Knight for MCW. A year later we see how terrible that trade was for the Bucks. The Bucks traded away a player with a career .480 eFG% for a player with a career eFG% of .433. Looking back, it’s pretty obvious that if MCW was on a good team during that 13-14 season, he would have been given significantly less opportunities to score and his raw scoring output would have been much lower.There’s always going to be examples of players with average to below average efficiency who get more than their share of a team’s shots. Monta Ellis (.480 career eFG%), Lou Williams (.474), and Kemba Walker (.452) come to mind. However, in my mind, Jamal Crawford will always be the epitome of this concept.The true stars and elite scorers in the NBA are the ones that can handle a tremendous offensive burden while maintaining above average efficiency. LeBron James, Kevin Durant, and Steph Curry are regularly among the leaders in efficiency while handling the largest workloads. It’s no surprise their teams remain competitive year after year when such a large percentage of their shots lead to incredibly efficient scoring.Basketball is about getting buckets, and fans will always gravitate towards the players that score, but NBA fans need to realize that points per game may be the least important stat when analyzing a player’s offensive output. You can’t make a blanket analysis based solely on the eye test and a box score. Deciding a player’s worth on such insignificant stats will open the door for your opinion to be swayed by the Jamal Crawford effect.Check out my blog if you're interested.",http://reddit.com/r/nba/comments/4beuur/c/d18jdq9,1458605721,nba,The Jamal Crawford Effect (OC),18,4beuur,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/4beuur,1458518400

I assumed that their projections came out to the actual revenue for this.
Also after crunching the numbers from 2013-14 and 2014-15. I came to the result that the salary cap * 30 teams comes out to about 36.64% of total revenue which includes non BRI. I used that and data from this season and the 2 before it to project into the 2016-17 and 2017-18.

1258,Do you know how many other great players didn't play either? ,1,"I like Steph Curry. He seems like a cool dude and is the best player on the best team since the 90s Bulls. He plays his game and does an amazing job of it, but he is the most overhyped player in modern history. The hype is understandable. We've never seen anyone shoot the three-ball like he does before. Lots of people have shot higher percentages, in fact this year he's currently 4th in 3pt%, but no one has ever put up as many threes as him and made them at such a high rate. He's shot 95 more threes than Harden who has second most, yet he's shooting 45.4% to Harden's 34.8%. He shoots off the dribble better than most great three point shooters do when they square up. When talking about three point shooting, all of the hype is warranted. He's a truly incredible three point shooter.The reason he is the most overhyped player possibly ever is because he isn't billed as the one of the best 3-point shooters ever, he's billed as the one of the most incredible players we've ever seen. He's being talked about in the same way as Michael Jordan or LeBron James. That is so far from reality it's worth looking at in a little more detail. Three point shooting is great for highlight reels, but for winning games it's just scoring. Two threes is the same as three twos. Same way a windmill dunk looks great on Sportscenter but on the scoreboard two points is two points. So just looking at Steph's scoring, he has never averaged more than 24.0 ppg in any season prior to this one. This year he has played in 48 games, slightly more than half a season, and is averaging 29.8 ppg before tonight. 29.8 ppg is very impressive but it's nowhere near historic. In fact 10 of the last 15 seasons the scoring champion has averaged more ppg. These are also for entire seasons, taking the best half-seasons from those players it would likely be more than 30 ppg every year in the last decade and a half. So naturally you'd say it's not that he's scoring a ton, it's that he's doing it at such a high percentage. His FG% isn't special because he takes so many threes, but his true shooting percentage, which is the most accurate measure, is historically high. Where it currently stands through 48 games doesn't crack the top 10 all-time though. But you notice the guys above him on the list, Wilt Chamberlain ""doesn't count"" because he was just so much better than his peers, Artis Gilmore averaged over 20 ppg doing it in the 80s but he was a center, and so is Tyson Chandler who didn't score that much. Kyle Korver is the only guy shooting lots of threes that had a season with a higher TS% than Curry has right now, and he averaged about half as many ppg. So if Curry finished the season at this rate he'd have the most impressive TS% ever, all things considered. But when you look at other guys in recent years, is it really impressive enough to ignore every other facet of his game that is average or below average to say this single half season makes him a historically great player? Last year was Curry's best full season when he averaged 23.8 ppg and had a TS% of 63.8%, good for 73rd all-time. He's behind other perimeter players like LeBron, Durant, Harden, Nash, Stockton, Reggie Miller etc. This season he's at 68% which is unprecedented for a perimeter player if it continues all year. But it's only 3% point higher than LeBron's 65% mark in 2013-14 when he averaged 27.1 ppg and was far superior in every other aspect of the game. Two seasons ago Durant averaged 32.0 ppg on a TS% of 63.5, and played better defense, had better rebounding, and only had one less assist per game despite not playing point guard. So before looking at all of Curry's deficiencies, is averaging 3 to 4.5% higher in TS% while scoring +/- 2.3 ppg than his contemporaries so amazing to put him in their category? Curry is not a good defender. He's not a liability like he used to be, but by no measure is he a good defender (Steve Kerr apparently agrees because he switched him off with Thompson last year in the playoffs any time the opposing PG handled the ball.) Stats aren't very useful for defense but his coach not trusting him to play on ball defense and him never receiving a vote for the all-defense team is indicative of where he's at, despite how much he's improved since he entered the league (when he was a liability on D.) For comparison LeBron has been named first team all-defense five times and was second team in 2013-14 when he had 27.1 ppg on 65% TS. Back to offense, Curry isn't a standout rebounder either. His current average of 5.3 rpg isn't bad at all, but it isn't particularly impressive like Westbrook's 7.4 rpg. Also doesn't compare to Durant's 32 ppg on 63.5 TS% with 6.7 rpg or Lebron's 8.0 rpg averaging 26.8 ppg on 64 TS%, among other years.Being Curry is a point guard, rebounding isn't expected, but he should have an edge in assists over other players that scored similarly over entire seasons. He doesn't. He is averaging 6.5 assists per game (not bad but not great, and 0.4 less than LeBron's career average) which is good for 12th in the league, but he is turning the ball over a lot (3.4 per game.) His assist turnover ratio is currently 50th best in the NBA at 1.91. And his team is scoring more points than almost any team ever and doing so with several great shooters so it's hard to excuse his assist/turnover ratio being worse than 49 other players. In summary, Curry's defense is average at best, his rebounding is average, his assist numbers are average but his assist/turnovers are well below average. His scoring is the one area of his game that is currently the best in the league, but averaging less than 30 ppg won't win the scoring title most years. Prior to this year he's never averaged more than 24.0 ppg and has never had a TS% higher than 63.8%, which has not only been surpassed by over 70 players but also ones that score more than he currently is. The only thing that makes Curry ""historic"" or belonging in the same breath as other MVPs or Hall of Famers is his TS% from half of one season. And his one stat that is on the level of the great ones is 4.5% better than Durant who averaged more points (32.0 ppg over an entire season,) and 3-4% better than LeBron's who average 64% and 65% in consecutive seasons, where he played in at least 76 games and averaged at least 26.8 ppg while being superior in every other aspect of the game. Scoring is the most fun part of the game to watch, and besides maybe posterizing dunks the three ball is the best way to watch someone score, but scoring at a slightly higher TS% while putting up a very precedented number of points doesn't make someone a HOF caliber player. His team success will likely make him the MVP for the second straight year and ESPN will continue to act like he's the best thing since sliced bread, but in reality he's only been a great scorer for half of one season of his career and every thing else about his game lags behind the company the media and many fans put him in. Having said all that, he seems like a really cool dude and is a great player, definitely one of the top 5 players of the last few years and is having the best season of anyone so far this year.

1304,"Really thorough article, and helpful to understand the whole picture. 

While many in the media and in general think of the sixers as a terrible destination for young stars, how many organizations out there would go to this extent or expense for a player who has no NBA minutes? Would Oden be better off if the Blazers had been so over-cautious and high-tech with their treatment of him? Would Brandon Roy still be in the league if he had access to this kind of treatment? It's hard to say.

(Pour one out for PDX)

What is certain is that the sixers are doing everything in their power to ensure Joel has a productive career. Whether or not they're successful, that's a draw for free agents when a team is at least competitive, as we've seen with the Suns staff's luring of Grant Hill and, more recently, Tyson Chandler.

Many more elements need to fall into place for the sixers to compete meaningfully for marquee free agents, but they've acquitted themselves well in their handling of Embiid.

Edit: Why did you adjust points for pace but not the defensive stats? Do you feel like that was a mistake?

Edit 2: 
&gt;Of course, sending a shot out of bounds probably will yield the biggest “OH!” from the crowd and benches, but it functions effectively as a reset button for the offensive possession

It is important to note that while the team maintains possession, the shot clock does not reset. The offensive team ""renews"" possession, but at the disadvantage of less time to find a shot.

1448,That's even better. More less stoppage.,2,"This idea hit me today, and I haven't seen anything proposed that makes more sense. I saw hacking in the '50/50 opinion' thread today, and it's pretty clear the two camps have one of the two following problems. A. Hacking slows the game down, fouls away from the ball don't qualify as 'basketball plays', so a rule change is needed to make the game smoother, quicker, and more aesthetically pleasing OrB. Make your damn free throws.So how do we keep free throw shooting as a necessity for players but not slow the game down/allow for the opposing team to take advantage of poor FT shooters?Stoppage Time!Well, Stoppage Shots actually. Or Free Time. Shoot Time, Penalty Time, call it whatever you like. It's really basic, any off the ball fouls resulting in free throws will result in a change of possession. Then, at the end of each quarter (excluding the 4th), said free throws are all applied at the same time. It creates an entirely new edge to the game, a damn interesting end to each quarter, with teams/players/fans always thinking ""ok, we're down 11 but we've got 6 free shots, let's say he sinks 50%, down 8, so now..."" etc, etc, etc.Overall I don't think we're going to see Free Shots used very much, mainly because I feel like it would remove the advantage.And if teams still feel like Hack-A-Dwight/Drummond/DJ a tense three minutes of angry Center standing alone at the line, missing 7 straight FTs while his team stands behind him stone faced would be enormously entertaining.There's a 100% I missed some crucial stuff and am an idiot and that this is a bad idea.

Absolutely unstoppable and universally agreed as his peak. ,1,"I was listening to Mike & Mike and heard Chris Webber's comments about how hand-checking made scoring more difficult, and it's banning has allowed smaller guards, namely Curry, to be greater players in the current era. However, I'd contend the illegal defense rule, which disallowed zone defense, had a much greater impact on the NBA. Isolation ball was exponentially easier, you could have your best offensive scorer abuse a defender since no one could leave their man. With zone defense being a viable option now, there are a multitude of defensive strategies at a coaches disposal. The most recent example is the Warriors putting Bogut on Tony Allen in their playoff series a couple years ago. This was essentially putting Allen on self-check since Bogut stayed in the paint which forced Allen to shoot jump-shots. The NBA is in a great space right now, and it's sad some of these guys from the older generation can't seem to appreciate that since their contributions helped make it what it is and what it's going to be going forward.

1718,"&gt;Overall, basketball in europe is a very real thing. Soccer might dominate the spotlight, but basketball is a very very very close second in many fans eyes.

This varies a lot on where you visit. Countries like Serbia, Greece and Turkey has a pretty big basketball following. But you would be hard pressed to find people who care about basketball in Scandinavia


",2,"Disclaimer: this might have a blog feel to it but I thought it was cool to share the experience of an NBA fan at a EuroLeague game. So this past weekend, actually yesterday in greece (im in USA now, hard to believe that it was just yesterday) I was lucky enough to go with some of my family to see Panathanikos play Lokomotiv Kuban Kransnodar. Now youre wondering wtf does this have to do with the NBA? well honestly I went to compare the atmosphere of basketball games in europe. boy was i impressed at the contrast.First off, some background on Pao (panathanikos). Theyre a greek sports club in athens whos main rival is olympiakos. They have 6 stars on top of their logo, symbolizing the 6 times theyve won the EuroLeague Championship. So this team is actually, low key, just as good as Real Madrid and Barce when it comes to basketball. And It showed They definitely dont have an NBA caliber team, but they sure make up for it by ball movement and plays off the dribble. Both teams did.Theyve also managed to win 2 ""triple crowns"" in a row which, contrary to popular belief, actually means they won the domestic Greek League, EuroLeague, and their Greek Cup. Im not all to familiar with the way the system is there, but they kinda translated the way soccer is set up into basketball.As far as Loko, which is short for Lokomotiv Kuban Kransnodar, I dont really know much other than they are a russian power house team who competes very well against the likes of Real, Barce, Olympiakos, and pao. Basically, from what I understood from my cousin was that it was CSSKA and Loko being the top 2 teams from russia.Travel: So the way we got to the game was through the subway. Panathanikos uses the old 2004 olympic stadium to play their games in, so this makes sense. I guess this is no different for fans who go watch the nets or knicks play. But to put it frank, there was basically no place for fans to park, and the places their were to park, nobody went because they ""wanted to save the 5 Euro"".. so we took the train which was an experience itself. People pregame like its a college game, except theyre like 27. This is a blurry pic of walking to the gate. the red lights are the old 2004 huge main olympic stadiumEntrance: This was basically the purest definition of a cluster fuck. Fans who havent paid for a ticket rushing the entrance has become sort of a real problem for this team, and I could assume it being a problem really around Greece in general. So to combat this issue, they have this crazy system of one by one letting people pass through a gate like this I was stuck here for an hour talking around 100 complaining people, fun stuff.Seats: Ok so we had assigned seats, for 15 Euro a pop, we got row 5 behind the basket.. not courtside, because the courtside got actual futon couches to sit on, no we werent there, but we were assigned decent seats. I soon learned that the word ""assigned"" had no weight, and basically it was a massive GA section amassing all corners of the stadium. if you really wanted to, you could fight it, but we found some dank boy junior seats anyway behind the basket.The People: these were some classic working class greeks. Fanatical fans. I kept on saying ""this is insane"" the noise was literally louder than some college games and the only think comporable to the noise level was a game 7. But, i dont know; it kept on going on and on and on, and it was literally kind of crazy. The chants, the passion, the intensity for such a game made no sense but i mean i guess thats just because im not used to this sort of basketball culture. This game wasnt too important honestly, it just wouldve given Pao home court advantage in the next stage if they won by 10..The most alarming thing, was that people would smoke cigs in the stadium, and nothing was done about it. I couldnt believe it. The court was literally hazy because of the cig smoke. that and the flair smokeThe chants and everything were incredibly vulgar and sexist, which was kinda hilarious in how ridiculous they were. I dont even want to go into the chants. lets just say they chanted very very loudOverall, basketball in europe is a very real thing. Soccer might dominate the spotlight, but basketball is a very very very close second in many fans eyes.Pace: the pace of the game was like 10MPH slower than the NBA. having said that, PAO scored 3 tmies in a row with alley opps, i thought i was watching lob city circa 2010. The defense was atrocious, and the shooting was hard to watch too, but it was so bad that it made the game fun to watch!TLDR: European basketball can be really fun to watch! just as exciting as an NBA game. And, at the end of it, it was an amazing experience to be a part of such a crazy bunch of people.I wish i had more pics, but my phone died.

1740,"If no ones guarding Curry, he becomes Kobe.",4,"In last night's game, about midway through the fourth quarter (or maybe near the end of the 3rd; I'm not totally sure), there was a sequence in which nearly all players were on the left side of the court. Bogut tapped the ball to Curry, standing all alone, behind the three-point arc on the right side.Curry held the ball for about 1 or 2 seconds, about a beat longer than anybody would have expected. He ultimately shot without dribbling and missed the 3PA.What interested me was the reaction by the OKC defense. When Curry caught the ball, nobody moved to close out on him, even during that extra second in which he was just holding the ball. In fact, if I saw correctly, 2 defenders started moving toward the opposite end of the court, as if Curry had already scored. TNT did not replay the sequence, and I didn't tape the game. If somebody can post the play, it might be an interesting illustration of OKC coaching or Curry's ability to demoralize defenders.",http://reddit.com/r/nba/comments/4901qd/c/d0o0tjd,1457138044,nba,[GIF Request] Thunder reaction to an open Curry 3PA,0,4901qd,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/4901qd,1457049600

This is the very last play of the 2Q after Kobe and LeBron had been going back and forth. Lakers have the ball with about 17 seconds left. Lakers have Kobe on left wing. All 4 other players are on the right side of the court. Cavs have LeBron guarding Kobe. A player at the top of the key, a player on the top and bottom block on the right side of the paint, and another player at the bottom of the block on the left side playing zone/help defense. Kobe gets a pissed off look on his face, and waives the Cavs player to get out of the way. 
I know Kobe is an Alpha and he points at people where to go, but I have never seen a player tell somebody on the other team to go to other side of the court, lol. Kobe and LeBron were having a good moment and wanted one more shot at him. Well, dude doesn't' listen to Kobe he comes out to double team so Kobe passes and the Lakers don't get a shot off in time.

1879,"From the NBA rulebook...
""Section IV-Thrower-in 
a. A thrower-in shall not (1) carry the ball onto the court; (2) fail to release the ball within 5 seconds; (3) touch it on the court before it has touched another player; (4) leave the designated throw-in spot; (5) throw the ball so that it enters the basket before touching anyone on the court; (6) step over the boundary line while inbounding the ball; (7) cause the ball to go out-of-bounds without being touched inbounds; (8) leave the playing surface to gain an advantage on a throw-in; (9) hand the ball to a player on the court. 
EXCEPTION: **After a field goal or free throw as a result of a personal foul, the thrower-in may run the end line or pass to a teammate behind the end line.**""",1,"At the end of the game, Covington is at the line with a 1 point lead, taking two shots. The Nuggets have no timeouts remaining, meaning they can't call one after the free throws to move the ball up court and set up a play.The obvious goal is to make both, having a 3 point lead, guaranteeing a win or at the least overtime. But Covington missed. The lead remained 1 point. He could make the next one, giving them a 2 point lead, and the Nuggets the opportunity to run the baseline, find an open player, maybe a studly rookie point guard, who could then gather the ball and get off what could only be a 3-point shot given the distance needed to travel and the time left on the clock. Unlikely scenario, but not impossible.An alternative, which as a Nuggets fan, I'm glad did not happen, would be to intentionally miss the second free throw. Sure, you go 0 for 2 in the ultimate clutch situation, but you still have the lead, and better yet, there is no opportunity to set up a play. The rebound might happen, but the clock is immediately rolling, and the Nuggets would have to scramble immediately to pull off what could only be a 3-point shot given the distance and time left. There seems to be no incentive to hit that second free throw, unless the Sixers were actively thinking that the Nuggets had a chance to take a 2-point shot in the closing seconds. If they had a timeout, sure, very plausible, you should make that second free throw if possible. But they had no way of advancing the ball up the court and could only take a 3-point shot. So why not miss purposefully, try to direct the ball to ricochet off of the rim unpredictably or at least quickly to catch the Nuggets off guard? I don't understand why a player wouldn't be coached to intentionally miss that second free throw in that situation, particularly coming off of a Sixers 20 second timeout and delay of game.",http://reddit.com/r/nba/comments/4bt6yh/c/d1ch81n,1458865146,nba,End of Nuggets-Sixers Game,4,4bt6yh,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/4bt6yh,1458777600
1880,"In terms of ""morals"" as you call it the NHL would reign supreme over the NBA, NFL, and MLB.  The players rarely end up on police reports, owners are not forced to sell teams because of racism, and the players are the most down to Earth.  ",-3,"Recently I have been researching the kind of effect that the NBA has on communities based around teams and I was astounded to to see the results. Since it was created in 2005, NBA Cares has raised over $200 million dollars and put in over 2.5 million hours of community service. The NFL has Play 60, but they do not have nearly as many hours put into community service as the NBA and their way of giving back is centered around playing sports, whereas NBA cares helps build homes, volunteers at soup kitchens, as well as sets up sports related clinics.
The reason for my research was because of the new Turner Broadcasting contract coming into play this year. When the contract starts, they will be making over 3 billion dollars a year from Turner alone. That money will be divvied up  throughout the league and, as many await, the salary cap will skyrocket, but what this could really mean is more money put into the surrounding communities. They have been giving 24 million annually back to communities but now they can potentially tie 78 million a year back if not more. The NBA would not only be one of the most community-involved leagues but it would be one of the most community-involved companies in the country. What do you think? 
As a basketball fan do you like to see them take action to give back?
Would you like to see them invest more money into the communities?

2036,"Right, the key is not 3's vs. 2's. What really matters at bottom is points per possession (PPP). So, let's say your offense has the option of taking an open dunk that goes in 90% of the time and an open 3 that goes in 75% of the time. The dunk is worth 1.80 PPP and the 3 is worth 2.25 PPP. In this scenario, the 3 is the better, more efficient offensive option. But let's say the player taking the 3 only shoots 33.33% on open 3's. Now the the 3 is only worth 1.00 PPP and the dunk is the better option (and a mid-range shot from a guy shooting 50% from there would be just as effective).

I think a lot of times, basketball is conceived of as a game where shots go in at roughly a 50% rate. And so people think that a 2 on average is worth around 1 PPP and a 3 is worth around 1.5 PPP, and therefore teams should shoot more threes. But that fails to consider that not all 2's are created equal, and neither are all 3's.

On any given possession, whether the best shot is a 2 or 3 depends on where the shot is taken, who is taking it, and how well defended it is.

Of course, there are other considerations like pace that impact the calculus as well. Since a high PPP may not be as effective over the course of a game if it takes a full 24 seconds to get the shot every possession. In other words, let's say you can score at 1.8 PPP on dunks every possession and 1.5 PPP on 3's every possession but can only do so at different paces such that you get 80 possessions of dunks in a game, but 100 possessions of 3's in a game (assuming you only do one or the other all game). At the end of the game you will have scored 144 points on dunks as compared to 150 points on 3's. But even that's not the end of the story because each team's pace affects that of the other, and fewer possessions means less opportunity for regression to the mean and thus greater likelihood of statistically variant results.

I suppose the conclusion is that every team needs to evaluate itself more critically to consider what the skills of its players are, and then figure out from there how to extract the most points per game (which will be based partly on maximizing their PPP) from that group of guys. Assuming that playing fast and shooting a lot of threes will guarantee more wins ipso facto is just unrealistic and misguided.",2,,http://reddit.com/r/nba/comments/49k1i0/c/d0slajm,1457474815,nba,"[Nylon Calculus] More teams are shooting threes however is shooting more threes vital to have a great offense?

2037,Dunc'd On should definitely be 2. Simmons deserves a mention and so does Sources Say on Channel 33.,7,"1) The Lowe Post This podcast is so great because Zach Lowe has a unique (among the media) level of understanding of the X-and-O tactical level of the game while also having relationships throughout the league that give him “insider” status. You will find minimal bullshit, groupthink, or lazy narratives in his interviews. The guests are 'ESPN’s finest' as well as some of the more influential people in the NBA, and Lowe asks extremely insightful questions in addition to giving his own opinions. If you miss Grantland, this is your podcast. 2) The Vertical Podcast with WojWoj talks to luminaries of the game, past and present, and asks really well-informed, blunt questions in a way that actually gets interesting answers. You get the feeling that Woj is very well-respected by the people he’s interviewing, which might motivate them to be a little more forthcoming than your average podcast guest. He also tends to go into the history and life experiences of the people he talks to, which are often actually very cool to hear about. I always find myself saying ""damn, that was a great interview"" after listening to an episode. There's usually an ""insider"" segment as well, where Woj and and someone else from the Vertical talk about what's going on in the league. 3) TrueHoop This podcast is basically 2 in 1. In its primary form, it is a roundtable discussion between Kevin Arnovitz, Brian Windhorst, and a combination of other ESPN reporters/analysts about the most significant current NBA events. Basically, this form is the cream of the crop of “mainstream” NBA coverage, as far as podcasts go, especially if you want to hear all the latest takes and gossip about the Cavs and the Warriors (which I admittedly do). Arnovitz and Windhorst also know a vast amount about the league, and it comes through in how they talk about current events. In the “after dark” version, it’s Amin ElHassan, Ethan Strauss, Tom Haberstroh, and ‘Wos’ talking about relatively similar topics but with more detailed and nuanced takes, and in a way that is often more controversial/entertaining.4) Dunc’d On Basketball PodcastFor in-depth game analysis, this podcast is absolutely unrivaled. Nate Duncan and Danny Leroux look at key possessions during games and break them down with the help of advanced analytics, which is something you won’t find anywhere else. For the regular season, they cover pretty much every team and every game, so if you want a catch-all NBA podcast, this is for you. Duncan and Leroux also talk about NBA salary structure and front-office/GM level topics, which can provide a broader context in which to frame everything else that’s going on in the league5) Locked On NBA David Locke does radio announcing for the Utah Jazz, and also has an extensive relationship with the team and its coaching staff. He does something that no other basketball podcast I’ve heard does: interviews real NBA scouts and front-office people anonymously, so that they can talk a little more freely. He also talks to some of the more interesting fellow members of the media (e.g. Zach Lowe, Kevin Pelton..), and asks insightful questions that you wouldn’t hear anywhere else. His relationship with the Jazz makes him a sharp observer of what’s going on in the league, as far as what a coach's perspective might be. 6) Open Floor: SI’s NBA Podcast This podcast consists of two types of episodes: Lee Jenkins interviews and Andrew Sharp/Ben Golliver discussion about current league events. The Jenkins interviews are great because Jenkins is genuinely interested in his guests and what you basically end up with is much more of a conversation than the standard, “transactional” reporter-player interview. Andrew Sharp (Grantland expatriate) brings a freshness and good vibe to his podcasts, and he and Golliver do a good job of mixing in current event analysis with off-the-cuff discussion about more general NBA topics.7) The Vertical Podcast with JJ RedickThis podcast is pretty unique, because JJ Redick is a current NBA player (and a damn good one, at that), and his guests are other current NBA players. They don’t really get into juicy gossip-level stuff that I think a lot of people would be dying to hear, but just having the perspectives of actual NBA basketball players makes this a really fascinating listen. 8) RealGM RadioI thought about putting this podcast lower because of how infrequent it is, but Danny Leroux’s interviews with other media members and people affiliated with the NBA are always worth the wait. He has very rational, stat-informed, anti-hot-takes about what’s going on in the league that are good to know if you want to understand the NBA on a detailed level. While this podcast is definitely not the best choice for “easy listening”, the interviews are super insightful and thought-provoking. 9) Jalen & JacobySince making the transition to being a regular ESPN TV/Radio show, Jalen Rose and David Jacoby don’t talk about only basketball anymore, but that’s still their main wheelhouse. At its best, this podcast is Jalen Rose keeping it ‘100’ and giving perspectives on what’s going on with a specific player or coach or team that you wouldn’t hear anywhere else and that make a LOT more sense than what the mainstream narrative might be. Jacoby also often has unique layman-style opinions on what’s going on, and when he and Jalen are jibing well this podcast is very entertaining to listen to.10) The StartersThe weekday episodes of this podcast are just audio rips of the show, so it's a little tough to not have the videos that they're referring to. The long-form ""Drop"" podcast on Fridays though is a very entertaining listen, and if you enjoy lots of random 'bits' mixed into your podcasts, such as the reading of a list of Twitter usernames or a 5-min discussion about 'Survivor', then this might be your favorite on the entire list. 11) The Vertical Podcast with Chris Mannix Interviews with players and coaches. 12) NBA LockdownHot take factory, narrative central. If you already listened to all your other podcasts and are still hungry for more NBA talk, then this is fine to listen to. The weekly ""insiders"" version with Marc Stein, Brian Windhorst, and Amin ElHassan is actually pretty good, but the others are mediocre.13) CBS Sports Eye On Basketball PodcastThis podcast is Zach Harper and a guest (usually another writer from CBS) talking about current NBA events. There's nothing wrong with it, and sometimes it's interesting, but rarely super insightful or entertaining. 14) The BBALLBREAKDOWN PodcastHaven't listened to that many. The Coach Nick interviews are good, and the others are mediocre.15) NBA A to Z This podcast mainly consists of reporting what's going on in the NBA. I left some out, either because I've never listened to them or they don't usually talk about basketball.Some [extremely] honorable mentions:The Bill Simmons Podcast""Sources Say"" on Channel 33",http://reddit.com/r/nba/comments/4cns0t/c/d1juv8y,1459386192,nba,NBA Podcast Power Ranking,10,4cns0t,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/4cns0t,1459382400

2152,"Damn, Draymond Green's rookie year stats are a fucking eyesore.",1,"With the discussions regarding D-Lo vs. Mudiay yesterday I noticed that a lot of people were talking about the fact that they thought Mudiay's potential was really limited because of the fact that he can't shoot. Accompanying this idea was the fact that he's sporting a gawdawful 41.0% TS this season. Basically, he'd need to improve that by 10+% to be considered a solidly efficient scorer, which is a lot. This got me wondering about other guys who came into the league and couldn't shoot, but developed into solid shooters as they progressed. Notable players with a sub-45% TS their rookie year:Danny Ainge (564 min)- 43.9% TS----->Career-55.5% TSMuggsy Bogues (1628 min)- 42.9% TS------>Career-50.6% TSGreg Anthony (1510 min)- 44.3% TS------>Career-51.0% TSDraymond Green (1061 min)- 40.6% TS------>Career-52.4% TS (57.3 This Year)Gerald Wallace (430 min)- 44.3% TS------->Career-54.9% TSMo Williams (772 min)- 43.3% TS------->Career-53.2% TS DeMarre Carroll (795 min)- 42.6% TS------>Career-54.7% TS....So obviously not a ton of star power there, but I think there are a few things working in Mudiay's favor:He's 19, has a good frame, and should develop physically a lot in the next few years, which should help his ability to get to and finish better at the basket, as well as exploit and overpower smaller PGs. He has a hitch in his shot. As opposed to being a guy who simply can't shoot, he's a guy with a clear flaw that (hopefully) can be fixed, leading to a smoother and more effective delivery. I believe in him. Idk man, I came into this post with the intention of posting some stats that back up the fact that I think Mudiay is just too young and too raw at this point to be judged harshly, especially since he's just been thrown right into the mix this year with Denver (Second among rookies in min. per and usage %). Still a believer, but as far as tangible analytic evidence: ¯_(ツ)_/¯",http://reddit.com/r/nba/comments/48twke/c/d0mpapq,1457050040,nba,Emmanuel Mudiay's Shooting,22,48twke,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/48twke,1456963200

The little fundamental.",11,"Disclamer: I will try to keep my fanboy-ism to a low.
So, Kawhi has been something else this year, hasn't he? His rapid improvment has given the Spurs something they have never had in the past. Other-worldly defenece, and consistent wing scoring.
http://www.basketball-reference.com/pi/shareit/1BIMg
This should give you a glimpse of how Kawhi slowly, but surely crept his way from a promising player, to an fringe MVP candidate. With increased PT, his FGA have jumped, but so did his field goal percentage. It took him a season to understand his role in the team, and coping with being the player who is guarded by the best defender. Now he bulked up and, with developed post game, and dynamite 3PT shooting, (shooting 46% at the time of writing this) he is second only to JJ Reddick in 3PT percentage. His eFG% has jumped to a quite frankly insane 57%. But, even before his new-and-improved offence, he was known for his defense:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3hnZ_knty6s
Also, advanced stats love them some Kawhi! Here is proof: http://www.basketball-reference.com/pi/shareit/9VPtF

2200,"I think it literally comes down to coaching and play calling. I don't know what Lue does half of the time tbh. We run plays for a quarter and then just go to pick n rolls. Defensively, we have been much worse under him.",1,"I don't know about you but I am sick and tired of the Cavs getting torched by opposing team's point guards. This team has a lot of problems right now, but one thing I don't see just magically changing is perimeter defense.I compiled this list of every game we played in February (not counting the game against the Pacers tonight). Let's look at a couple notes here:In the game against the Hornets on 2/3/16, Jeremy Lin stepped up in Kemba Walker's absence and just roasted us.In the game against the Pelicans, Norris fucking Cole outscored future superstar Anthony Davis.In the game against the Lakers, Lou Will and Jordan Clarkson, both guys who average ~15ppg, hit us for 28 and 22 respectively. That's unacceptable!Out of those 12 games, only two teams didn't have their PG as their high scorer for the game. First was Rudy Gay on the Kings, but only because Rondo is notorious for not being a scorer. The second being Kevin Durant, but don't worry, Westbrook was close behind KD's 26 with 20 of his own.Listen, I'm not going to pout about Westbrook dropping 20 on us; in fact, that's actually below his average, so I can live with that. But Jeremy Lin should not hit us for 24. Norris Cole shouldn't drop 26 on us. Kyle Lowry shouldn't fuck our assholes with a roll of quarters and put 43 on us.Obviously Kyrie is not fit to handle these team's point guards. I know PG is one of the toughest positions to guard, but there comes a point when something has to change. The problem is, it's not just a case of ""better offense > good defense"". I can live with Steph Curry draining a bunch of 3's from 40 feet out. The issue is that Kyrie can't stay in front of anyone, so these guys have free lanes to the basket. They're getting easy layups, driving and drawing a foul, or collapsing the defense and kicking out for an open 3. Opposing PG's literally have their way with our defense. These opposing PG's are allowed to play their game completely un-impeded and however they want to play.I think the Cavs should start the playoffs with Delly at PG and move Kyrie to the SG position and make him play off the ball. Kyrie is still young and still has several years of bad habits to break; he still iso's when he should pass, and still makes mistakes that elite POINT guards shouldn't be making. To be completely honest, if we're talking in terms of traditional positions, he's more fit for an SG role.Delly proved to us last year in the Finals that he's capable of defending at a high level. Nobody is ever going to lock down Steph Curry, but Delly can play him physically and do his best to limit Steph's options. Kyrie can't (or won't) do that. More importantly, with an elite Point Forward named LeBron James on our team, having someone listed as ""point guard"" is really kind of irrelevant. I think Kyrie, LeBron, and Delly are all capable of running the offense. Therefore, I don't think it's important to have Kyrie as ""starting PG"". I think a lot of players and coaches look at a starting lineup in terms of ""guards and bigs"", or G/F/C. I think PG/SG/SF/PF/C is more for the media. I think the media likes to be able to say ""Kyrie is starting at PG for the Cavs"". But does it really matter, if LeBron is the one bringing up the ball the majority of the time, and the offense is run through him? At that point who cares who ""started at PG""? So what's the difference if the Cavs start two ""guards"", Kyrie and Delly, and three ""forwards"", LeBron, K Love, and Tristan Thompson? On defense, Delly can guard Lowry, Wall, Rose, IT, etc. On offense, Kyrie can run the plays or play off the ball. I'm not a coach but I think he should play off the ball more. He's absolutely lethal on catch & shoots, and it prevents him from playing hero ball like he tries to do.Am I absolutely insane for thinking this? I think it would solve a couple of problems the Cavs have. At least it's better than sitting here and hoping they're able to ""turn it on"" when the playoffs start.",http://reddit.com/r/nba/comments/48czpw/c/d0iwmy3,1456801060,nba,Cavs should start Delly in the playoffs,0,48czpw,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/48czpw,1456704000

But, the more i think of it, it's not a game like Baseball where you're like, ""wow, this guy had 39 homers last year"" and now you'd be like well, if he had x more games he would have had whatever""...most of the stats are in average form...I have no clue how many total rebounds Dwight Howard had in 2007 and don't really care.

2293,"There's a few reasons for this. A good offense more often thn not tends to win over a good defense. In basketball an individual player can have more impact offensively than he can defensively. While a lot of plays written by coaches offensively require teamwork, an individual player can still take over the game. A great offensive player will have a variety of moves in their arsenal to score the basketball. Defensively on the other hand, team defense is drastically more important than individual defense. There's a reason players get double teamed and you don't have 1 defender defending 2 players in the coaches play. Some players can score through 2 defenders but no defender can defend 2 players, except maybe Hakeem if he was having a great game. A good defense will be so that if a player drives or gets past the first defender, there's another player waiting to stop him. Or it could be continuous switches to interrupt the player's ball rhythm. Whatever it is, defense in basketball is a very good example of 1 + 1 = 3. Or in this case it's more 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 10. There's a reason only 2 players have ever won DPOY and MVP in the same season, offense is regarded as more important than defense. In regards to Kawhi being the MVP over Curry, there's more to it than being  a star. Even if the Spurs didn't have Kawhi, they would still be on a very smooth sail to the playoffs. They wouldn't be as dominant sure but they wouldn't have extreme difficulty. The warriors without curry on the other hand are a very different team. Their road is a lot rockier than it has and would be. One other point is when you have a great offensive player on your team, it takes a lot of pressure of of their team mates. The warriors know if they're in a tight spot, Curry will take the shot for them even if it's a bad shot. That's what it means to be the leader of his team with such shooting profficency. Defense is a little different, you aren't thinking about how Kawhi is going to stop this guy, you're making sure to stay on your man cause if you let them get off on you, the coach is coming for your neck",3,"The great defensive players in this league seem to go undervalued. While some teams have the luxury of being able to surround lesser defensive players with adequate defenders, some teams don’t have this luxury. This is where players, for example James harden, get exposed. On the other hand, Steph curry is not a great individual defender, but the GSW have great team defence and can cover for him. With this comes another question. Should we value defence more in deciding the MVP? Now I know we have an award for DPOY. But, the MVP award isn’t the Offensive player of the year, so we should be taking defence into account more. I still believe Curry is the MVP this season, which is unquestionable. But should it be so unanimous with what Kawhi Leonard is doing on both ends? Being an elite player on both ends of the floor surely counts more toward being the Most Valuable Player than just being a great offensive player.

2317,Glad you're around to keep people honest,0,"I have to preface this by saying that I really like Zach and wish he did more stuff.  The past couple of months, he's pretty consistently turned out one column a week, and, other than the Sloan Conference stuff, two podcasts a week at most.  I think maybe he was on TV once or twice this year (not sure because I don't watch ESPN).   It seems like he does nothing but watch NBA games, as he references in almost every podcast where he talks about having no life.  Assuming he puts in a regular work week, what is he doing with the rest of his time?  I'm sure the fans of the team appreciate it, and I like that he focuses on unheralded players, but sometimes I feel like his talents would be better spent writing smaller pieces more often than 5,000 word columns about the plays the Bucks run.  I know those pieces are very labor intensive since they require a lot of time and travel.      Dunc'd On is my go-to podcast, and Nate Duncan regularly has like three very in-depth podcasts a week in addition to occasional writing.  This is kind of what I would expect from someone who's full-time job is covering the NBA.    I fully admit I have no idea if he is totally hamstrung by ESPN.

2318,"Kidd had a knack for not only making players better on the floor, but also off the court. I remember reading about when he first met up with the team for after getting traded, he told everyone that the ""losing stops now"". It changed everyone's mindset. He has a demeanor about himself. He never seems to come off at you like he's gonna eat you up like KG, but you can see it on guys' faces when they played with him: they hated disappointing him, which is why he's such a successful coach right now. Not to mention his BBIQ is off the charts and he sees you open before you even know you were open. A prime Jason Kidd, although a terrible and inconsistent jumpshot, was still a threat on the floor because although he couldn't shoot lights out, he had enough range to keep you honest and if he drove the ball, you knew it was gonna be a simple pull up, layup, or a pass to a post man or the perimeter. He knew where his guys were at all times.

Defense, Fast breaks, open 3s, ball movement. That defined the Nets of that era. When there was a rebound, no one stood around or jogged to the other side. You always had someone booking it for a fast break whether that was Kidd himself, Kerry Kittles, KVH, Lucious Harris, young RJefferson ,and even a young K-Mart. Everyone was running and looking for an open shot. K-Mart wasn't the best offensive player, but it's the small things he did to get teammates open and his PnR ability with Kidd that freed up many guys on the perimeter. 

TL;DR: Jason Kidd has the ability to literally make everyone around him better.",2,Can someone give me a background on these guys?

2344,"&gt;  But obviously, once your squared up with your arm in your shooting motion, the ball will almost automatically go to you finger pads creating daylight in between the ball and your palm.

I was talking about that on another comment. That's how people teach shooting. They (I'm making a **huge** assumption here) teach that because that's where the ball goes naturally. As I said below, you can't shoot directly from the palm. That's more of a throw or some shit. Once you bring the ball back in your shot motion, the ball will naturally fall onto the balls of your hand, which will create daylight

So coaches will teach you to just keep the ball on the balls of your hand all the time because they know that's the correct form at some point in your shot

But with kids with smaller hands, this is tough to do, so what do they do? They open their hands a bit more and this introduces tension. You can make a ton of great shots this way, but no tension is always better than tension, so if you can't comfortably hold the ball like an NBA player then you shouldn't go by their word because it's so different

But either way, teaches teach the balls of the hand/daylight method, and even Steph does. It's just what's taught, but great shooters in the NBA aren't doing it right now. That tension is no joke",12,"Curry is a palm shooter. So why is this interesting? Well, if you've ever played or have ever went through the process of shooting the ""correct"" way, then you know that this is apparently a HUGE no-no. Steph Curry even teaches you not to do this by saying you need to have a little ""daylight"" between the ball and your palmAnother thing that is interesting (which is in teh same video) is his hand placement on the ball when going up for the shot. His index finger and his thumb make a little V while he's holding the ball and going into his shotSo keeping these two things in mind, I (of course) went outside and put up shots for about 4 hours going between this form and what I was doing before just to see what the difference is. The difference is actually noticeableMy hand placement is the traditional shit they teach you. Pretty much what any player would teach you. Keep the ball on those finger pads at the base of your fingers and keep your hands pretty much wide open. It's a form that most players have, but not the form the greatest shooter of all time hasSo when I let my index and thumb form a V and rested the ball on my palm..it felt weird, but my shots seemed better. This part is going to be super anecdotal (obviously) but I'll explain it anyways.I don't have small hands. I can palm the ball. If I spread my fingers out while shooting, I do seemingly have more control of the ball but it feels like I'm palming it. It's very hard to relax with my fingers all spread out, and if I spread them out and try to keep them on the pads under my fingers, then it really feels like I'm just palming the ball for the shot. I feel like a ton of guys fall into this category. Even by doing this, I can still make shots, but sometimes when I miss shots it seems like 1 finger made a world of difference when it shouldn't have. Logically that makes sense. If you involve your fingers throughout the duration of your shot, and your fingers aren't consistent, then you're going to miss shots or barely make shotsBack to Steph. Now if you were to open your hand wide, or even somewhat wide, as if you were going to shoot the ball then you'll notice 2 things. One you won't be able to have a V between your index and thumb. Depending on how wide you open, you'll turn that V into a very wide U, so what does that tell you? That tells you that Steph doesn't open his hand as wide as possible. He doesn't even come close to that. This part is importantThe next thing to notice when you spread your fingers out is your wrist. You definitely won't think about this while actually shooting and you probably won't think about it now...but when you begin to open your fingers up you add a fuckton of tension in your wrist. There's no way in hell you can open your hand without feeling tension. Since Curry (from what I see) doesn't open his fingers wide at all (because his thumb and index maintain a V throughout his form) then Curry's wrist is super relaxed and this is the first thing I noticed when checking out his shotAs far as the palm shooting goes, I noticed that I got more fingers involved when shooting from my palm. A lot of people say that shooting from the palm is  bad because it can fuck with your accuracy and your arc,but that's so vague. Without telling exactly how that fucks with your accuracy...should you really believe it? I sure as hell don't. Some shots, at first, were going flat, but I'm not new to this. All I did was slightly raise the ball from my normal set point and that fixed the flat shotNow something I noticed with shooting from the palm is that you honestly can't just shoot from the palm. What happens is that the moment you feel the ball on your palm and go into your shot, you shift the ball to a very comfortable position on your finger pads and as you release the ball the shot will look pretty much normal, and this is why I think Curry doesn't think he shoots on his palm. Watching his shot at normal speed doesn't show any signs of shooting from the palm because his palm is really just the pocket that holds the ball for a tiny second. This pocket, imo, is much better than keeping the ball off your palm the entire timeSo instead of people worrying about whether or not the ball is, or isn't, on the palm of the hand, people need to talk about tension in their wristYou ever look at Dwight and DeAndre's form and be like ""they look like they can shoot..but they just can't""? Well take a look at this. Look at what Dwight does right before he brings the ball up to shoot. Dwight does what I've been doing for years. Dwight does what he's been taught. He spreads his fingers out before raising the ball because he's been taught to have your fingers spread and have the ball on your pads. If you don't see it, put it in slow motion. He first has the ball positioned, but then he does a very subtle readjustment of his thumb (you can tell because of how he slightly picks his thumb up and puts it down. If you're going into your shot with a set form then you don't need to do this. He does this to spread his fingers out a bit more, so he basically palms the ball)Now look at Dwight here shooting casual free throws. Look at before he brings the ball up, you see that V? You see how relaxed his hand is? Whether or not he actually made that shot is one thing, but I'm willing to bet he did make itHere's another video of Dwight shooting. If you watch the free throws before that one, you see how relaxed his hand is (even tho he still adjusts it before the shot) but with this specific shot you see how he tenses up before the shot. That tension causes the miss. At 56 seconds in the same video you see the same thingSo enough with Dwight, back to Curry. I think Curry has realized that the most important thing about shooting is having a relaxed hand. Even when you think your hand is relaxed when shooting right now, I guarantee you can relax it even more by not spreading it and allowing your palm to cup the ball to help balance before the shot. Although everyone teaches against this...I'm really beginning to think this is the way to go. You shouldn't have to spread any fingers out or anything, just keep it relaxed and once you put the ball in your hand, your fingers will naturally spread and keep your wrist super relaxedI think his relaxed wrist is why he's so consistent. If you're always shooting from a relaxed hand, then you don't have to worry about its consistency. Do you know how easy it is to replicate being relaxed? But it's very difficult to replicate spreading your fingers. How far do you spread? Do you spread all the way? Are you even sure you spread all the way out on your last shot?The more I look into his shot, the more I realize how simple it is. From his feet, knees, hand, wrist, set point, and all that shit..his shot is all about being relaxed. It's very easy to replicate that relaxed feeling because that's the feeling you want when you do anything...and that's what I think makes him the greatest shooter we'll ever see, and as long as coaches continue to teach the older way of shooting...I highly doubt we'll ever see another Curry",http://reddit.com/r/nba/comments/4ab48x/c/d0ywxut,1457923172,nba,Something interesting about Curry's shot (and a little on Dwight's free throw shooting form),166,4ab48x,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/4ab48x,1457913600

• strong outside shooter

• improved his 3 point percentage to a lofty .523% on 7.9 attempts per game (exact as Harden, this season, oddly enough)

• NBA range, and even beyond, rendering him a player that needs to be guarded out to 26 feet away from the hoop

• 53% from the field, 53% from deep, and 90% from the stripe,

• creating for himself, and for others

• the ability to dribble out of trouble, change speeds, and get past defenders

• From a defensive standpoint, he is very solid considering the offensive load he carries for his team

• he may not project as an elite defender, but he’s more than physically capable

Harden is 6'5, 225

Hield is 6'4, 215

2416,the tempo changed?,1,"One of the interesting things looking up basketball-reference is how scoring leaders in terms of PPG has changed.For instance, a lot of people made a big deal about D'Antoni's first Suns team with Nash and Amare for their powerful offense. Well, courtesy of some research on basketball-reference.com, Phoenix had some more ferocious scoring attacks way back when.Example- the 2005 Suns' 110.4 ppg were tops that year, but the franchise actually had years with more offensive horsepower before they came along.In 1993, they averaged 113.4 ppg. 1979, they averaged 115.4 ppg. In 1989, they had an astonishing 118.6 ppg!D'Antoni's 2005 Suns 110.4 ppg would not have cracked the top 5 in 1989-90. Hell, the expansion Orlando Magic of 1989-90 had 110.9 PPG (and that was a 60-loss team!)The 2005 Suns had 20 games where they scored 120 points or more. The 1979 Suns had 29 games with over 120 points, and the 1989 Suns did it 39 times!The 2005 Suns only twice had over 130 points, going as high as 136. The 1993 Suns did that 5 times, the 1979 Suns did it 8 times (going as high as 143), and the 1989 Suns did it 13 times (as high as 154)Only twice under D'Antoni did Phoenix go over 140- and both those games needed overtime. The Suns did that three times alone in regulation back in 1989!Or the Dallas Mavericks- in 2002, they were #1 in scoring at 105.2 ppg. But that pales in comparison to their 116.7 ppg in 1987!My point is that the offenses were truly ridiculous potent for many, many years before the numbers slowed down.Hell, even the lesser teams could still light it up- the 1985 Warriors (who had the worst record in the league) averaged 110 PPG!As recently as 1992-93, all but two teams averaged 100 PPG. In 1993-94, the number of teams without 100 PPG dipped to 7 and 11 in 1995.Suddenly, teams were struggling to hit 100-110 PPG with great consistency. 1997-98's #1 offense (Lakers, 105.5) wouldn't have made 1985's top 15!How did it go from one extreme to the other?

2452,Kinda the opposite for me.  I hate Michigan State and we drafted Draymond.,17,"Really liked this post on R/CFB and it immediately inspired me to post this here. For years, I have loved LeBron. Followed him since he was 17 and I was 14. So, because of that, there are naturally some teams I have grown to hate. The main culprits are the Boston Celtics and the Chicago Bulls. Specifically, I have always despised Chicago, Joakim Noah and Derrick Rose (in a healthy, ""I'm a fan of another team"" way)Well, last year my university (Universiry of Arkansas) had its first first-round pick in a decade. His name is Bobby Portis. He grew up in my hometown of Little Rock, he came up through the same AAU system that I played in growing up and he is connected to many coaches and people who had a huge impact in my life. Not to mention, he's an amazing kid and exactly the kind of guy you love to root for. Well, don't you know, the f***ing Bulls drafted him!! Ugh! One of my close friends who I love to talk basketball with is a Bulls fan and I was so jealous/angry about it. Until I saw Portis suit up for the first time. I can't help myself but root for them. Portis plays so hard and doesn't take any second he's on the court for granted and it's impossible not to love. So, now I watch Bulls games pretty regularly and root for them in said games. I feel dirty lol. TL,DR: I love Bobby Portis and he got drafted by the Bulls who I hate.There's got to be more stories like this out there.

2577,truth,0,"I know the NBA doesn't allow it, and this is purely a hypothetical. But with both Blatt and Lue, Lebron seems to be essentially towering over them and having a stronger say. People said that Pat Riley didn't let him do that in Miami and kept him in check, which is what allowed Miami to thrive, because he was forced to obey the guidance of Spolestra, just like every other player. However, Cavs organization seems to bend to his will, and it's unlikely that there would be a coach that would be able to disagree with Lebron and not cause tension. That being said, Lebron has a brilliant basketball mind. He's talked about visualizing games, and you know he has plays and ideas for the game flowing through his head. He's shown himself to be a powerful leader that the organization rallies around and prides himself on. He's essentially hand picked his teammates as well, so he has a system in mind for how he expects it all to work out. If there was that clear guidance in Lebron as a player-coach, perhaps chemistry issues would disappear, and the Cavs can find their working system?If you DO agree to this theory, then is there any reason why the Cavs can't hire a figurehead head coach, but have Lebron be the de facto head coach?",http://reddit.com/r/nba/comments/4ckl49/c/d1j1lcn,1459346421,nba,Serious question: Do you think the Cavaliers would have less chemistry issues if Lebron became an official player-coach?,11,4ckl49,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/4ckl49,1459296000

Most teams trend towards “pace and space” and play with one big man and one primary ball-handler who are surrounded by three wing players, all of whom can shoot.

During this time, they have always ranked in the bottom half of the league in terms of pace and have even managed to improve on the number of possessions a game each year, but continue to slide down the league rankings all the way to second last this season.  While the Raptors don’t have a high frequency of possessions which would be classified as “fast breaks” or “transition”, the possessions which are up-tempo in nature are effective and deliberate. The Raptors rank in the bottom 10 for frequency of transition plays, accounting for 11.5% of their possessions, yet they are the most efficient team in the league in transition, scoring 1.21 PPP1. Here are a variety of ways in which they both simply and effectively beat teams in transition, regardless of how sparingly it occurs.Drag Screen  A drag screen is essentially a pick and roll in (semi) transition. The goal is to get all of the effects of a regular pick and roll (allow the ball handler to gain an advantage, whether it be penetration or an open shot) but without any of the hassle of the defense being set. The Raptors’ primary ball-handlers, DeMar DeRozan and Kyle Lowry, both excel at getting to the rim in a half-court setting, but allowing these two to get easier paths to the rim is crucial, especially considering some of the tight spacing due to personnel.  Drag Screen: Ball-Handler CompilationSimple miscommunications become more numerous when drag screens are used when compared to their traditional, half court counterpart.
Here, you can see the Bulls have the advantage in terms of players that are actually in the active half of the court.
Yet, when Valanciunas sets a drag screen for Lowry, Gibson acts as the big man defender that “showed” on the pick and roll, even though that is Gasol’s role. Gibson does a poor job of impeding Lowry’s progress while Rose recovers, and allows Lowry to continue his drive to the rim. Because Gasol wasn’t active defensively from the start, he doesn’t jump in at any point.  In that same photo, we can see where Gasol’s focus was (red arrow, following roll man) versus where he should’ve rotated to (white arrow, stopping Lowry drive to rim). If he were to have done so, Moore would’ve rotated from the weak side behind him and Lowry would have had to make a difficult baseline pass to DeRozan for three, a much more palatable shot for the Bulls than an uncontested layup.  The upside of this play is that it is bound to produce a ton of penetration, which naturally leads to help defenders collapsing in on the ball-handler. As a result, Raptors’ ball-handlers have become accustomed to dishing the rock to the roll man as well as properly spaced shooters.Drag Screen: Passing CompilationDouble DragSimilar in nature to the regular Drag Screen, a Double Drag Screen is very effective in its own right. As you might have guessed, it is the same principal as a drag screen, except there are two screeners instead of the traditional one.Double Drag Screen: Ball-Handler Scoring & Passing CompilationThe advantage gained here can be assigned to a few factors. Firstly, when using an action that preys on the lack of preparation a defense, it is beneficial to have variance, even if it is nominal. Secondly, it pulls a second big man away from the paint/rim. If the big man doesn’t come out and defend, Patrick Patterson is bound to bomb away from deep. When the secondary big man does come away from the paint, it opens up driving lanes for the ball-handler, as well as the rolling screener, both of which have opportunities to finish at the rim.Additionally, another benefit to using sets such as these is that it allows for easy transition into other actions, such as Wide Pindowns.Wide PindownsHere, Biyombo and Patterson set a Double Drag screen for Lowry and unfortunately, no advantage is gained. Biyombo quickly acknowledges this and goes into the next action by screening for DeRozan. On the catch, DeRozan uses Biyombo as a shield and punishes the defender for not trailing him on his hip and drains the jumper. More traditionally, in transition a Wide Pindown is usually set for one of the Raptors’ wing players, such as DeRozan or Ross, as the primary action. In doing so, the big men act as screeners early on in the offense to try and catch a defender sleeping. The Raptors aim for the defender to stay on DeRozan’s hip as he drives to the hoop, though he is no stranger to taking a tough shot if an easier one isn’t immediately presented.Wide Pindown: Ball-Handler CompilationThe Raptors also like to have their wings flow through and exchange sides of the court if a Pindown doesn’t work in their favour initially. Afterwards, DeRozan will typically have a Flare screen set and work off of any separation he can get.Similarly to the Drag Screen, a Wide Pindown early on in the clock can gain penetration, leading to an inevitable breakdown of the defense and an open look for the big man who was originally a screener.Wide Pindown: Passing CompilationOutro  It is clear that the Raptors have found use in their methodical, early offensive sets. They are a slower team in nature, which works in their favour. They love to get to the line and exhaust every opportunity to find the perfect driving lane to get there. While that is their M.O. as an offense, they also make great use of finding easy buckets that provide them with similar shot distribution. It isn’t as bountiful in volume Golden State's transition offense, but it doesn’t need to be. An efficient easy look here-and-there is enough to grease the wheels and keep their methodical offense chugging along. The Raptors have found a nice balance in understanding their strength, which lies in their two best perimeter players, which can sometimes take time as they find their best look, while also attacking (relatively) early when the opportunity presents itself.

2609,"Portland Trail Blazers vs Detroit Pistons 
Sunday March 6 2016 
Pick 2 of 3: For today's NBA Picks

Current spread: Portland Trail Blazers -1

The Portland Trail Blazers travel to Detroit to take on the Pistons in what will be the second and final meeting between the two teams this season. Detroit took the first game in Portland by the score of 120-103. This score is largely skewed in the 4th quarter where the Pistons outscored a healthy Trail Blazers team 41-11. That did not settle well with the team as they went into the quarter with a 13 point lead only to get embarrassed. Drummond posted monster stats with 29 points and 27 rebound which the Trail Blazers had no answer for. But this was a time in the season where the Trail Blazers were struggling and the team has really gelled together since losing several stars in the offseason. 

The Trail Blazers will play their final game of a 6 game Eastern Conference road trip where they are currently 3-2 on the trip. Their most recent loss to the Raptors was a thriller; Lillard scored 50 points in the teams 117-115 loss. During this road trip the team has lost to the Celtics (3rd place) and Raptors (2nd place); butt beat the Knicks (13th place), Bulls (8th place) and Pacers (7th place). The Pistons who currently sit in 9th place were playing great basketball until their recent 2 games. Both games were on the road but they failed to score 90 points in either game; including a loss to a Knicks team who really don't have any motive to win. Both teams are fighting to secure a playoff berth and you'll likely see that type of effort on the court tonight.

The Trail Blazers play a high tempo game and have managed to work around their problems with getting boards over the season. They will have their hands full with Drummond on both sides of the court but with playoff implications being a situation these days don't be surprised if the Trail Blazers use the hack-a-Drummond tactic. Drummond is the worst free throw shooter in the NBA and with playoffs on the line the Trail Blazers will likely use all the strategies they can to win if needed. Regardless Lillard is the best shooter on the court tonight and Reggie Jackson will have his hands full guarding the stud. Winning 7 of the last 10 and Lillard looking unstoppable these days, I like the Trail Blazers in this one.

I'm not going to listen to Scott Brooks or Thibs after they've already been on the Vertical. Sidebar: Lowe is getting a little old for me. I use to love his articles and pods, but the more I listen to him, he comes across as an arrogant nerd. He asks long-ass questions interjecting his own theories that I think guests are confused or annoyed by. Lowe is a good writer, but is overrated.Anyway, back to the topic, does anyone else find that Mannix, Woj, and Redick all kind of sound like a-holes? I find it's the matter-of-fact way of speaking they all have, like they're just not polished for interviewing people, or don't sound personable. I can't quite put my finger on it, but they don't come across as natural or likable. 
I was just listening to Mannix interview Dennis Schroder in the car, and it felt like his tone was well off (e.g. not sympathetic at all) when Dennis was talking about racial bullying at school.

",1,"First, let me preface this by saying BYRON SCOTT IS A TERRIBLE NBA COACH. I AM NOT ARGUING HE IS A GOOD COACH. Ok, now that we've gotten that out of the way, let's look at the issue at hand. Was Byron Scott's treatment of Russell ""tough love"" which was supposed to light a fire under the rookie and/or humble him? And is it working?Here's a look at Russell's per game stats from his first 20 games:11 points / 4.5 ast / 2.2 TO / 1 Stl / 1 FTA / 39.2% FG / 2.05 Ast/TOSo from that what jumps out to me are that he only averaged one FTA and shot under 40% from the field, but a pretty respectable Ast/TO and pretty low TOs for a rookie PG period. Russell's per game numbers from his last 10 games:20.7 points / 4.3 ast / 2.1 TO / 1.1 Stl / 5 FTA / 44.2% FG / 2.04 Ast/TOBoth of the glaring weaknesses I saw in the first 20 stats have been improved significantly. 5 FTA would rank 29th in the NBA versus 1 FTA which would be among the lowest. Also improved his FG shooting 5 points. Now, whether any of these samples are statistically significant is another argument, but I do think that people who worried about Scott stunting the growth of Russell have actually seen the opposite happen. Whether that's because of Scott's coaching or it was inevitable given Russell's talent is up to the eye of the beholder, but I'm just glad Russell is starting to look like the guy many of us thought he would be.

Assuming a similar 4 yr contract structure exists, you would have to risk alot to do this.This is really useful going forward, because the scale is EXTREMELY useful in the next few years before the CBA shuffle, because you are paying top prospects 6-7M with a 90M cap.

It got me thinking, this might be the makings of yet another record. To BB Ref!In the 1972-1973 season, well before most of us were born (sadly for me, probably before some of your parents were born), the Boston Celtics had one of the best seasons of all time--5th best to date (excluding this unfinished season) with an amazing 68 wins, or a .829 win percentage.In the same division were the lowly 76ers. They had a bit of a rough year, finishing out with...well, 9 wins.  Congrats 76ers fans! You've got one team beat for sure! Well, at least tied. SorryStillMadAtIversonAfter some complicated math known as basic arithmetic, we arrive at a differential of 59 games, the NBA record for games back in a division at season end.It's a longshot, but assuming the Dubs beat the Bulls' record, and the Lakers continue their armored warfare against difficult opponents like the Suns, we could see this long standing record tied or broken.  Which, if you think about it, is rather astounding. 59GB in an 82 game season... that's amazing!  In fact, that's not too far off the MLB record, where they play 430 games or something.So what do you guys think?

If the Bulls don't come back in the East Finals, I don't think the Knicks beat them.It's not like they embarassed themselves in the Finals- games 2, 4, and 6 were close and could have gone either way.That was just a case of running into the 'Would not let his team lose no matter what and was hellbent on winning' Jordan that literally could carry a team.

2889,"&gt; 2011: Traded to the Knicks, Lost to the Rondo/KG/Allen/Pierce celtics at the tail end of their run.

&gt;2012: Heat

&gt;2013: Pacers at their peak with PG/Lance/Hibbert/Hill/West

I'd even add that the team was in ruins in all of those series as well. The Boston series, Amare fucked up his back in warmups of game 2, which was the start of the injury train for Amare. Billups also went down with a knee injury in game 2. Melo put up 43, but it wasn't enough. We were relying heavily on an injured Toney Douglas from then on.

The Heat series we were without Amare (Full strength anyway, he got us one game though. Fuck you, Fire Extinguisher), Lin, and eventually Shump (Torn ACL in game 1, 5 minutes after D-Rose did iirc), and Baron Davis' kneecap rocketed into the stands in game 3. Oh yeah, Tyson got his annual playoff flu too.

Pacers series was more of the same. JR no showed and Tyson got his annual playoff malady (his back this time). Shump coming off the ACL was our 2nd best player that series, a damn shame. Kidd forgot how to shoot that March.

&gt;His legacy was hurt because the Knicks had to give up a lot just to get melo via trade, and those knicks teams were not able to recover because of the loss of either good or young players (iirc, included Gallanari, Wilson Chandler, Mozgov, Felton, Anthony Randolph) and picks.

I still maintain that was worth it. Gallo had knee concerns even back then, Wilson is cool, but no biggy anyway. Moz was insanely raw and Randolph at that point hadn't done anything, still hasn't. Felton hurt, but we got Billups too which was okay. It was all the subsequent moves that hurt us (Bargs trade) in the long run.",1,"Just a random question a friend from work asked me, thought it was interesting. Where do you think he would rank?

Going back to the wrestling thing, NXT (their developmental) was a shitty reality show until they changed everything about it. They need to either treat it like  baseball or axe it. ",1,"First off, let high schoolers declare for the draft again. In return, players that are not graduating seniors have D-League contracts for their minimum rookie contracts with the option to be called up after their first season. This lets players transition from playing in Lawrence or Lexington to playing in Los Angeles or Miami. And yes, this takes away from rookie sensations, but it gives us a Bryce Harper effect of anticipation.

2934,"I'd say even up until the early 2000s, 40-min players were the norm.  AI was famous for wanting to play the entire game and getting pissed if he was pulled for rest.

What's changed since then is the legalization of zone defenses.  Before the rule change, defense was man-to-man with the occasional hard double, so it was actually fairly easy to conserve energy on defense as long as you weren't guarding the main scorer or your coach didn't call for a full-court press (pressing was also more prevalent in the '90s than now).  Nowadays, you hear the terms ""help-and-recover,"" ""all-on-a-string,"" and ""team defense"" exponentially more often than before zone was legal because now those terms are more meaningful.  As an NBA defender, especially with how important the 3-point line has gotten (the other big rule change besides legalizing zone in the past 50 years), you have to cover so much more ground on defense now, the energy expended is so much more draining.

3027,imagine if he got a long term ankle injury on saturday,1,"A collaboration between /u/Fatal_Conceit and /u/The_NGUYENNER, written by /u/The_NGUYENNERActual Will Barton Quote, Just for /r/nba!!! via /u/THE_NGUYENNERI asked Will Barton if he could dunk on any of his teammates who would it be. Jokic overheard the question and his goofy ass started pointing at himself trying to get Barton to bite, but Will decided it was “probably a tie between Gallo and Kenneth; because Kenneth jumps real high and that's like an achievement. And Gallo just because Gallo's got a lot of swag so, he don't ever get embarrassed.”Well good luck to Gallo and Faried because I’ve seen this man DEFY GRAVITY.WHAT THE HELL IS WILL BARTON?He’s The People’s Champ. No no, not this “People’s Champ”. THIS one. Given all the minutes he could handle for the first time in his career, Will ‘The Thrill’ has seized the opportunity and ran with it. And I mean ran with it. Let’s take a closer look at the fourth year phenom and examine what exactly makes him so thrilling.LIGHTNING IN A BOTTLE OFFENSE""I’m so creative that most of the time I don’t even know what I’m going to do.” 1The lynchpin to Barton’s success has been his unpredictability. A liability to finish at any moment’s notice, Barton is virtually unguardable as he plays with a chaotic style similar to a Buffalo Soldier riding a wild Bronco he can hardly control (shoutout to the Superbowl champs). He’s the kind of guy who enjoys leaving you lost, taking it all the way to the rim, and fist bumping a baby on his way to the locker room. If you take your eye off of him for a second he’ll come soaring in like an eagle for a monster dunk.  He’ll drive and throw a ridiculous pass that’ll make you say “holy shit, how was this dude ever compared to Corey Brewer??” Barton will be driving SIDEWAYS and he’ll just throw up one of these bullshit hookshot/floater things. And no, that wasn’t a fluke. Unguardable.When you think Will is committed to the drive, he’ll fake it, pull up on a dime and ask you if you want a jumper or a floater. If he’s feeling especially cruel he’ll drive in and hit you with a stepback. Try to overplay him and he’ll lose you easily with his surprisingly good handles. He’ll drive, fake the pass then dunk it on your face. Are you getting the picture here??? You cannot stop him. Will Barton and Will Barton alone decides whether or not he’s going to miss. And that’s just when he’s driving. Pair him up with a partner to run the pick-and-roll with and he becomes ELITE.PICK AND ROLL EFFICIENCYBarton has become one of the league’s best at running the pick-and-roll. Combining his frenetic play, seemingly limitless skillset and creative passing, Barton leaves his opponents bamboozled. He’s 14th in the NBA with 0.911 points per play when he’s the pick-and-roll ball-handler, higher than some of the league’s biggest names -- LeBron James, Chris Paul, Russell Westbrook.2 While Barton’s always had pure speed and aggressiveness as threats, this season he’s improved immensely on the subtleties of the pick-and-roll like learning how to manipulate opponents to get the look he wants as well as being able to make the pass to the roller. Look at how he probes the defense, finding the weak spot and exploiting it. He cunningly snakes through traffic, seemingly getting to the rim at will. When the defense sinks too far into the paint, afraid of being dazzled by another dribble-drive, he pulls up on a dime. Any way they defend it, he has an answer. IMPROVED SHOOTINGTo balance out his threat as a chaotic slasher and unlock his full potential as a player, the key to Barton’s success has always lied in the consistency of his shooting. Luckily, both Barton and the organization know this. Dan Connelly, who just happens to be both Nuggets GM Tim Connelly’s brother as well as Barton’s longtime trainer, was in his ear the entire offseason preaching one thing:“People have been telling him the whole time, like, ‘Hey, get your jumper right, get your jumper right.’ And I think it kind of clicked, like, ‘Hey, if my jumper is right, I can do everything.’ And I told him this summer, ‘I want you to get psychotic about your shooting form.’ I said, ‘Every time you finish a shot, I want you to make sure it’s the same way every single time.'”3That tireless work paid off as Barton went from shooting a dreaded 27.1% from three last year to a solid 35.8% this season. Don’t think that’s just a case of small sample size either… he’s launching four threes per game. More importantly than his overall perimeter percentage is his catch-and-shoot efficiency where he’s converting at a 38.5% clip from outside. Through sheer determination and repetition, Barton has transformed himself into a legitimately lethal three-point threat.(Bonus)Outside shooting may be what ties his game together but Barton’s true gift is his dominance in the open court. In the words of the almighty Zach Lowe, “Barton doesn't thrive in transition. He creates transition from thin air”.4 A liability to take it all the way against the entire team, Barton can finish the break with both finesse and force. Or he can simply throw down lobs from his teammates of course.DEFENSEA plus-defender, Barton uses his anticipation, explosiveness and 6’10” wingspan to make all those who challenge him pay. He’ll hunt you down in transition if he has to. If you’re not going up strong, prepare to get embarrassed. In addition, he’ll pick your pocket and dunk on the other end before you even know what happened. Barton wreaks havoc on nearby ballhandlers, harassing them with his pesky hands and throwing casual no-look oops in transition. Seeing the common theme? When Barton gets the steal it’s 2 points. “Man blocks and steals don’t mean you can play defense!!!!” Hey man, just ask Harden. Will gets the freedom to roam since Gary Harris usually takes the best player on the other team, but Barton is fully capable when called upon. Barton knows when it’s time to lock it down.Will Barton have it all.If you enjoyed this and want all the Nuggets content you can handle, follow me on Twitter @The_NGUYENNER and check out my writings at BSNDenver.com",http://reddit.com/r/nba/comments/48ct1q/c/d0iyjo7,1456804054,nba,[OC] What the Hell is Will Barton (With Streamables!),146,48ct1q,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/48ct1q,1456704000

And yes, Jamal is a bad defender, but Green has no intention of dribbling, making him work for that pass isn't difficult",2,"The Spurs' latest iteration of their magical loop play is making it's rounds on this page, which got me thinking: why doesn't the defender at the top of the arc (in this example, Jamal Crawford) push up on the ball-handler (Danny Green) and try to take away the passing lane.Crawford not only gives Green a clear line of sight to hit Mills for the catch and shoot, but he even seems like he's shading Green that way. The loop play takes so long to develop, it seems like any one of the defenders on the baseline should be able to identify the loop coming and yell at Crawford to press Green and force him to his left, so that he can't make that easy pass to Mills.The counter argument might be that Green can attack the basket, but are you that worried about Danny Green beating you off the dribble when the paint is so clogged with screeners and defenders? I'd rather let Green drive by and have to face DeAndre Jordan at the rim than give Mills the wide open 3.It gets a little sketchier to press the passer when it's Ginobili or Leonard, who have the ability to take it to the rim and finish in traffic, but I don't see a reason why Crawford doesn't try to disrupt the play and force Green to do something off the dribble.I'm sure there's something I'm missing, but I can't stop thinking about it.

So I was watching the blazers-wizards and thought to myself ""man Gerald Henderson has to be the most average player ever"" but he was having a good game so I decided to look at his stats. I was shocked to see his shooting % eerily looks like the league averages. So i went deeper and averaged the per game stats for every NBA player this season. I was again, shocked that most of his per game stats look like the league averages - mainly points, attempts, minutes, shooting %, age etc. So I had a glass of water, recovered from the shock and decided to post this and dare you to find a closer match On average he's 9.85% removed from the average NBA player in each category. He really fucked me over on assists, offensive rebounds and blocks (4% otherwise), get your shit together Gerald. Also - His height doesn't really work, he's 6'5 and the average is 6'6.98"" but his weight is pretty close - listed as 215 lb. and the average is 220.

3131,"I meant he's putting too much stock in the next 1-2 games. He's trying to discount his success this season by saying he hasn't played anyone, and saying that these next games matter way more. ",7,"When a player is on an NCAA tournament hot streak like the one Oklahoma’s Buddy Hield is on, NBA scouts have to ask if they can believe what they are seeing. In terms of predicting a pro career, success in March means nothing — for every Kemba Walker, there’s a Shabazz Napier fighting to stay in the league. So what are we really seeing with Buddy?Hield is averaging 25.4 points per game, the highest scoring average by a player entering the Final Four since Georgia Tech’s Dennis Scott in 1990. Coming off a 37-point Elite Eight performance against the 1-seed Oregon Ducks on Saturday, his stock is so high that some are wondering whether the Sooners wing, projected as a second-rounder after his junior season, could go first in the upcoming NBA draft.The question facing the scouts is simple: Whom has Buddy been beating to get these numbers? There aren’t a lot of great teams in this tournament, and there aren’t a lot of great prospects in this year’s draft class. Most of his peers — Hield is 22 years old — are already in the NBA.Hield hasn’t faced great talent this season. He matched up with Villanova’s Josh Hart in nonconference play, and the best Big 12 competition he saw (aside from Baylor’s Taurean Prince, who was playing zone defense) came from Wesley Iwundu (Kansas State) and Wayne Selden Jr. (Kansas).However, it’s not so much who is guarding Hield as it is whom he is guarding. The best way to slow down a scorer is to attack his legs on defense, and Hield hasn’t faced many players (or any) who can do that. In the NBA, it doesn’t matter how many points you can score if you’re giving them right back on the other end of the floor.Hield has the physical tools to be a good defender. At 6-foot-4, 215 pounds, with a 6-foot-8 wingspan, he has prototypical 2-guard size. And while he’s not an elite athlete, he’s not going to get blown off the court.The Sooners advancing to the Final Four gives scouts a chance to see Hield throw down against better competition. A win over Villanova (and another round with Hart) would mean a game against either North Carolina’s Justin Jackson or Syracuse’s Malachi Richardson and Michael Gbinije, all three of whom are 6-foot-6 (at least) NBA-caliber athletes with the ability to challenge Hield on both sides of the ball.At the next level, everyone Hield will face will be as good (and likely better) as those guys. How he performs against his Final Four foes could be the truest predictor of how he’ll fare in the NBA.",http://reddit.com/r/nba/comments/4cb32j/c/d1gl0fn,1459187464,nba,Can we believe in Buddy Hield?

3160,"Detroit beat GSW once and Portland (who beat GSW) twice, so that helps. They've also beaten OKC and the Raptors. ",4,"Hola /r/nba,Out of curiosity, I've put together a simple power ranking based on Larry Page and Sergey Brin's PageRank algorithm, which is (well, used to be) the basis for how Google ranks web pages. The PageRank Power Ranking is derived from what I'm calling the Season Game Outcomes Graph, which is a directed graph that describes the outcomes of all of the games of the season. Each team is a vertex in the graph, and when team A beats team B, an arrow is drawn from B to A. That is, for each game, an arrow points from the loser to the winner. The result is a big mess that looks like this. I'm trying to figure out useful ways to visualize this, because this is not particularly informative to look at.To think about what PageRank does, think about a little guy walking around this graph. He always walks in the direction of an arrow. At each vertex, he chooses a random arrow to walk along, and walks to the vertex that that arrow points to. Roughly speaking, for each team, PageRank computes the probability that the little guy ends up on that team after he walks for a long time. So if you think about what that should spit out, the little guy should end up standing on GSW, since there are the most arrows pointed at it. On the other hand, he'll hardly ever end up on PHI since there are hardly any arrows pointed there.This is not interesting. Almost any ranking of this season will put GSW at the top and PHI on the bottom. What's interesting is thinking about everyone else. Since the little guy has such a high likelihood of landing on GSW, that gives him a higher likelihood of landing on the teams that GSW points to. So if a team beats GSW, they get a relatively big boost to their PageRank score. On the other hand, if a team beats PHI, that does hardly anything for the likelihood that the guy ends up on their vertex, since the guy isn't ever ending up on PHI anyway.The result is that the PageRank power ranking gives higher weight to beating good teams than beating bad teams.I've done a bit of preliminary work to show that this particular ranking method does better than looking at the raw W/L percentage, which I might post in a little while. Either way, the results are interesting in my opinion. So without further ado, the PageRank Power Rankings for the 2015-2016 season, games up to and including March 29, 2016:Observations.There's probably more to notice.There's a whole lot more information in the Season Outcomes Graph that could be used for things like this, but I just thought I'd share this start.Finally, if you're interested, here's a graph of the teams' PageRanks over time. I made this a few days ago, so it doesn't go up to yesterday. It shows some interesting things about the PageRank system—when the Bucks beat GSW, they immediately shot up to become the highest ranked team in the league. That's probably not quite right. I've been trying to think of ways to put weights on things so that that doesn't happen, but I think that the results at this point in the season are pretty sane. It might just be that this system doesn't work so well until all teams have at least a few wins and losses. ---Edit---As requested, some previous seasons2014-20152013-20142012-20132011-20122010-2011I can do more on request, if there are requests.Conclusion: SAS is really really good.Edit 21995-1996'96 Bulls beating '16 Warriors in PageRank, but it's close!

3209,"RAPM does not measure who the ""best"" player is. RAPM measures how lineups with a player over or underachieve based on who they are playing with and against.

In other words, RAPM does not say that Klay is the 3rd best player in the league. RAPM says that the Klay has the third most impact in the league.

We can, as humans, contextualize what  RAPM is saying. Here, we can understand as follows: Three man lineups with Steph, Klay, and Dray overachieve relative to lineups without all 3 of those (whether it's 2 of 3, 1 of 3, or 0 of 3). Specifically, we can argue as people who watch games and not just read stats that Klay provides elite spacing, and Dray makes doubling Curry hard on the PnR a futile exercise. As a result, Klay &amp; Dray combined *allow Curry to absolutely dominate* by neutering any potential gameplan against Curry. Without Klay, it's easier to ""bump"" Dray on the 4v3 and recover to the shooter. Without Dray, trapping Curry on the PnR is possible without compromising your defense (as much).

Like every stat, RAPM is context-dependent. Unlike other stats, it's a lot clearer what the stat says. RAPM doesn't know that the majority of production during Curry/ Dray/ Klay lineups is attributed to the MVP. All it knows is when Klay is on the floor, the team plays better. Whether it's because Klay is dominating (nah) or Klay enables people to dominate (yeah) it can't decipher.

So the reason why I used RAPM to evaluate TT is because we're not concerned with how good TT is in a vacuum. Depending on role, etc., this will change. Great as Curry is, if we slotted him at the 5, specifically guarding centers, he'd be terrible right? We want to know how he plays on the Cavs specifically, and the answer is clear, he plays well.",1,"Talk about the LeBron James effect on his contract talks, and his play.

In on Dec. 19, 2007, a scorekeeper incorrectly said Shaquille O'Neal fouled out, even though he only had 5 fouls. The Atlanta Hawks won the game in OT 117-111, but the Heat were able to protest and force a replay on March 8, 2008.After replaying the last 51.9 seconds of the game, the end result was again a Hawks win, albeit by a score of 114-111.However, Shaquille O'Neal (traded to PHX for Shawn Marion and Marcus Banks) was not available for the replay, even though he was the reason the Heat were able to force a replay in the first place. Although there was a replay and the Hawks won ""again"", would the results have been different if Shaq was still on the team (or even available just for the replay) instead of Shawn Marion and Marcus Banks?If the Hawks had lost the game, their final record would have dropped to 36-46, placing them in a tie with Indiana for the 8th and final playoff spot. The Pacers, who had the head-to-head advantage against the Hawks that year (2-1) would have made the playoffs and played the 1-seed and eventual champion Boston Celtics.The Phoenix Suns, who owned Atlanta's draft pick that year, would have been able to select in the lottery at pick #11 (assuming the lottery played out the same). Jerryd Bayless was chosen at this spot. Phoenix may have opted to select Bayless at this spot as the successor to Nash, and not have made a draft-day trade to select Goran Dragic. The Pacers would have selected at #15, where the Suns originally chose Robin Lopez. It's possible that Indiana would select Lopez at this spot, passing on two-time all star (how Sway) Roy Hibbert. But unlikely. Would Atlanta have continued on this long streak of playoff appearances had they not made the playoffs? Would this playoff appearance have sparked Indiana, and caused them to miss out on the chance to select Paul George? Do we have free will? Who knows.Edit: 
I was inspired by this threadHighlights of the Dec. 19 2007 gameIncorrect play-by-play from 12/19/07 - ESPNCorrect play-by play from 12/19/07 - BBREF A foul with 3:24 in the 4th quarter was erroneously attributed to Shaquille O'Neal, when in fact it was Udonis Haslem who fouled Marvin Williams. TL;DRBecause a game between the Hawks and Heat had to be replayed without the original players (notably Shaq missing for Miami), the 2008 playoffs were affected, and Atlanta, not Indiana ended up with the last playoff spot. What effects this may have had on the playoff future of Atlanta, Indiana, and how it could have affected the draft are interesting things to explore.

3275,"Yeah, that's still correct.  If they can possibly still be eliminated, it means they don't clinch in that scenario.",3,"Phoenix:  Phoenix is eliminated with a loss in any of their 3 games, or with a Houston win in any of their 4 games, or with 2 Jazz wins in their 3 non-Phoenix games.  Dallas is irrelevant because there's no possible tiebreaker scenario in which Phoenix comes out ahead of Dallas.Brooklyn:  Brooklyn is eliminated with a loss in any of their 4 games, or a Detroit win in any of their 3 non-Brooklyn games, or 2 Chicago wins in 3 non-Brooklyn games, or with 4 Washington wins in their 4 games.  Since there are several games between these two teams, one of these situations is quite likely to happen.  Even if Brooklyn runs the table this week, they would need either Philadelphia or New York to pick up a win against Washington.Minnesota:  Minnesota is eliminated if a great big tiebreakery mess turns out against them.  If the sum of their losses in 3 games and the minimum of Dallas and Houston Wins in four each is equal to 5, then they would definitely be eliminated.  I think a direct tie with Houston would keep them from being eliminated unless they actually lose the game against Houston this week, in which case they lose the tiebreaker head to head, but I think a 3 way tie with Sacramento can keep them from being eliminated regardless of who the tie is with.  Also, if the Jazz win 2 more games than the lesser of Houston and Dallas during that time period, that can also mess with things because it means that each of those teams would gain a win at some point later in the season.New Orleans:  New Orleans can not be eliminated this week.  If they lose all 4 of their games and Dallas and Houston win all 4 of theirs, then in the event that Dallas loses out, a possible 3 way tie with Sacramento guarantees that New Orleans remains playoff eligible.New York:  New York can not be eliminated this week since they hold the tiebreaker over Detroit, so that even if every single Eastern Conference team were to get to 38 wins, the possibility of a head to head tie with Detroit for the last playoff spot would keep New York in.Cleveland:  Cleveland can clinch a playoff spot if their number of wins + the minimum of Detroit and Chicago losses equals 3.  Indiana can both affect the number of Detroit + Chicago losses necessary if they lose as well.  Atlanta may be able to as well, but I don't think Charlotte can affect the necessary number of losses even if they lost out this week.Toronto:  Toronto can clinch a playoff spot if the sum of their wins in 5 games and the minimum of Detroit and Chicago losses in their games over the week adds to 6.Oklahoma City:  OKC can clinch a playoff spot if the sum of their wins and the Jazz losses equals 4.  If it equals 3 the Thunder can possibly still be eliminated by a 3 way tie scenario depending on the result of the Portland game tomorrow.  Also, Portland, Houston, and Dallas could each lose enough games to allow OKC to clinch a spot.LA Clippers:  The Clippers clinch if they win every game this week and the Jazz lose every game this week, with the exception of 2.  The Rockets and Mavericks can also enter the fray with a relatively bad week.Memphis:  Memphis can not clinch a playoff spot this week, since even if they win all 4 games, the Jazz lose their 4 games, and the Nuggets lose 2 or more games, the Grizzlies could still be eliminated by the head to head matchup with the Jazz.Boston:  Can not clinch -- Winning all their games this week puts them at 43 wins, and even if the Bulls and Pistons lost all their games, that would just get them to 37 guaranteed losses (4 games, plus Detroit and Chicago have 1 game remaining between themselves on the schedule).  Since 43 wins requires 39 losses to clinch, the Celtics, and by extension, anyone lower in the Eastern Conference standings, can not clinch this week.tl;dr:  3 teams can be eliminated this week, and 4 can clinch their spots in the playoffs.

**actual article:**

NEW YORK – Jimmy Butler has recently tried to make all talk concerning his left knee off limits.

He had no choice but to lift that ban after a loss to New York in Madison Square Garden on Thursday night.

According to a source, Butler was told that exploratory surgery on the knee was in play as soon as the season comes to an end.

And while he was initially vague when asked about it, the All-Star didn’t take that scenario off the table.

“Maybe. I hope not,’’ Butler told the Sun-Times. “Is my knee the same as it was before the injury? No.

“But I want to play, man. And at times I feel like I’m hurting this team. That’s the most disappointing part because I’m not the player I was. I don’t know if there’s something really wrong in there, but it’s not really right, either. But I’ll be fine. I have to figure out a way to help us win playing with this. That’s all I’m worried about.’’

Well, not all he’s worried about.

Since injuring the knee back on Feb. 5 in Denver, Butler isn’t even close to resembling the elite player he was before the injury.

He was averaging 22.4 points and 5.2 rebounds per game before the knee betrayed him and shooting 46 percent from the field. Since making his return, however, he was averaging 15.8 points and 5.0 rebounds while shooting a dismal 39 percent from the field.

Away from the numbers, however, there’s no explosion in his game offensively, and far too often Butler admittedly is opting to pass the ball in mid-attack of the paint rather than challenge the defense at the rim.

Defensively – which was the Butler calling card – he seems a tick slow.

All of this, despite being cleared to play by Bulls team doctors, as well as Dr. James Andrews telling him there was nothing structurally wrong with the knee.

“It’s probably in the back of his mind a little bit,’’ coach Fred Hoiberg said. “But I think that gave him some reassurance was when he went down and saw Dr. Andrews and got a clean-belt of health that everything in there was OK structurally. For him, and all players, not just Jimmy, you need to be out there reacting rather than out there thinking.’’

Butler is thinking.

He’s thinking that something feels wrong in the knee still, but with just 11 regular-season games left and the Bulls trying to claw back into a playoff spot, there’s no time for a breather.

Butler is a gym rat in every sense of the definition, and in his world when something is off, he simply hits the gym with the members of his camp and fixes it. There’s not time for that right now, and that’s what has him concerned.

“I think it’s getting over the mental right now,’’ Butler said of the knee. “It’s more mental. And usually I can get into the gym and get into it, but the way these games are coming on the schedule, you’ve got to rest your body. That’s the hardest part.

“I don’t want this offseason to start early, that’s for sure. But if [the playoffs don’t] happen, I can get back into the gym and work on what I need to do. Right now I have to do it in the game and do it under fire. It’s just not reacting like I want it to.’’",1,,http://reddit.com/r/nba/comments/4bwpld/c/d1d1a09,1458916847,nba,Jimmy Butler could need off-season knee surgery,1,4bwpld,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/4bwpld,1458864000

What people overlook is that Melo has a 15% trade kicker built into his contract.You don't hear about trade kickers too often because usually teams don't bother with them. Why? It's simple: A trade kicker cannot raise a player's net salary over his maximum salary. If you're a max player, there's usually no point to trade kicker since in general, players' annual Bird 7.5% raises grow faster than the cap rises. In other words, they will always be making the max or more for each year of their deal, so a trade kicker wouldn't actually make them extra money.With the cap jumping at an absurd rate though, that won't be the case for Carmelo starting this summer. If Carmelo is traded this summer, he will receive a lump sum that represents 15% of the remaining salary on his contract -- about $13m.Now, let's look at the options Carmelo had in summer 2014. I imagine his agent would have laid out to him three options:Once the trade kicker is factored in, the option to stay with NY for two years is without question the best financial option for Carmelo. The upside is only marginally lower than even the best option, but the floor is so much higher, and given Melo's age, the floor had to be a real concern. This option also gives Melo the chance to show some loyalty to NY and have a real say of where he goes without having to take the major pay cut of a free agency contract.If this was a shared plan for NY and Melo from the beginning, which seems likely given the NTC and trade kicker that were incorporated into the deal, then it seems very very likely that Carmelo will be traded this summer. Melo will be highly motivated to make it happen since his trade kicker goes down in value the longer he waits. The Knicks will be motivated to do it since Melo's contract is all liability to a rebuilding team, and the market will further encourage the Knicks as teams will have gobs of cap space and be looking for alternatives to the shitty FA market to fill it.Edit: Just to clarify, smart people had highly accurate projections of the new cap before the new TV deal was signed, so I'm sure Melo's agent knew that as well (or else why get the trade kicker?). Source from three months before the TV deal was signed that projects the cap jumps almost perfectly: http://www.boxscoregeeks.com/articles/a-layman-s-guide-to-the-coming-nba-salary-cap-apocalypse",http://reddit.com/r/nba/comments/4bez6g/c/d18ijzs,1458604464,nba,An alternative view of why Carmelo re-signed with New York and why a Melo trade this summer may have been the plan all along,0,4bez6g,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/4bez6g,1458518400

3520,"Yep, because Portland is the home team. Based on the point spread, I'm estimating Portland gets -0.5 against OKC, so pretty close! Also consider, Portland won the last game against OKC at home, 115-110. It could really go either way, especially if OKC has #3 locked up and Portland is still fighting for position in early April.",1,"The race at the top of the West is pretty much locked in - barring a collapse by GS, they'll end up with the #1 seed, and the Spurs are already guaranteed at least #2. OKC has enough distance on the Clippers to more or less call them at #3 and #4 at this point. Even Memphis is all alone in the #5 spot, 3.5 games behind LAC and 4.5 ahead of Portland.The real race in the West this season is for spots #6-9. Today's standings are:One of these teams will get to avoid the Warriors and Spurs in the 1st round, and take their chances against OKC. One of these teams won't make the playoffs at all. The other two teams won't be so lucky.ProjectionsSo who is likely to make the cut? Here are short breakdowns of their remaining games:*Projected wins are based on point spreads of remaining games, which take into account both home/away splits and remaining opponents.PortlandLikely wins: vs 76ers, vs Kings, at Kings, vs Timberwolves, vs NuggetsLikely loss: at WarriorsTossups: vs Celtics, vs Heat, vs ThunderMy money would be on Portland to finish strong, with all but two of their games at home. UtahLikely wins: at Timberwolves, vs Lakers, vs Timberwolves, at Suns, at Nuggets, at LakersLikely losses: vs Warriors, vs Spurs, vs ClippersTossups: vs MavericksUtah has a great shot at getting into the playoffs again for the first time since 2012 - but while their remaining road schedule is forgiving, their home games are not.HoustonLikely wins: vs Bulls, vs Suns, vs Lakers, at Timberwolves, vs KingsLikely losses: at Pacers, at CavaliersTossups: vs Raptors, vs Thunder, at MavericksHouston gets the edge over Dallas by virtue of a more favorable home/away split, plus winning the head to head tiebreaker - they currently lead 2-1 in the series, but if they lose in Dallas, they will still likely have a better division record.DallasLikely wins: at Kings, at Nuggets, vs Knicks, at TimberwolvesLikely losses: at Warriors, at Clippers, vs SpursTossups: at Pistons, vs Rockets, vs Grizzlies, at JazzDallas has one of the toughest schedules left in the league, with only 4 home games to 7 road games - and the home games aren't easy, with division games against Houston, Memphis, and San Antonio.Bonus round: Tiebreakers!Portland is likely not to need it, but they own the tiebreaker against Utah 3-1. They're tied with Houston 2-2, but currently have an edge in conference record, 25-21 to 24-22. They actually lose their tiebreak against Dallas, 1-2.As mentioned above, Houston is guaranteed a tiebreaker against Dallas, as they can do no worse than split the season series, and unless the Mavs win out against all three of the Rockets/Grizzlies/Spurs, Houston will have a better division record.Houston has already split the season series with Utah, 2-2, which means the better conference record wins - currently Houston has the edge, 24-22 vs 19-23 for Utah.The tiebreaker between Dallas and Utah depends entirely on the outcome of their remaining game. They only play 3 games this season, and are tied 1-1, so the Apr. 11 game Mavs at Jazz will be the decider.Also, who doesn't like 3-way ties? If Utah, Houston, and Dallas all end up with the same record, the head to head to head matchup matters first. If Houston loses their last game against Dallas, they'll be 4-4 against the others. Whoever wins the Mavs at Jazz game will be 4-3, and take the #7 spot - the loser will be 3-4, and out of the playoffs at #9, while Houston is #8. Alternatively, if Houston beats Dallas in their game, they'll take #7, and the Mavs at Jazz game will decide #8 and 9.",http://reddit.com/r/nba/comments/4bxwx6/c/d1ehfn6,1459022933,nba,The playoff race out West,56,4bxwx6,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/4bxwx6,1458864000

3549,"oh thank you! praised be to Michael, he has filled our gaping void!",-6,"Hey r/nba, my name is Michael and some friends and I recently launched a sports and pop culture website to fill the void left in our lives by Grantland. In addition to being my first article for the site, this piece about Joe Johnson is also the first long-form article I have written about the NBA. I have included the text of the article and a link to our site at the bottom, per request of the mods. Make sure to check out all the other articles we have on the site and let me know what you think!This piece about Joe Johnson was written about a week and a half ago (and posted 3/17) so some of the numbers might be a bit dated. However, I think the overall points still stand. Enjoy!On February 27th, the Miami Heat beat out the Cleveland Cavaliers for the services of 7-time All Star Joe Johnson. Johnson, most recently of the Brooklyn Nets, was one of the highest paid players in the league at almost $25M. For some perspective, LeBron James is currently making a shade under $23M and Steph Curry, on probably one of the best contracts in NBA history, is making barely $11M. So it makes sense that the Nets would part with the aging star. The team is heading in a completely different direction after their “Big 3” experiment failed, and needs to unload money to pursue veteran free agents and make the team somewhat competitive as they await the return of the first round draft picks Billy King traded away like wampum.The bigger surprise was that Johnson chose to take his talents to South Beach rather than Cleveland in what we can only assume is to chase a ring. Cleveland currently tops the Eastern Conference and has the third best record in the NBA brought about by LeBron James, Kyrie Irving, Kevin Love, and a host of role players. Meanwhile, Miami currently sits in fourth in the conference with legitimate questions about the health of their second best player, Chris Bosh. Additionally, the cornerstone of the franchise, Dwyane Wade, is showing signs of age and injury while averaging 19 points, 4 rebounds, and 5 assists per game. All of this begs the question, why did Johnson pass-up on what many consider a sure fire finals appearance to play in Miami? While we can’t answer that for him, we can look at the impact he’s had on the team and what it could mean for a potential playoff run for the Heat.By The NumbersIn the 10 games since Johnson has joined the Heat it is evident that his presence has made a huge impact, most notably in Offensive Rating and 3P%. According to the numbers above, the team is scoring 7.5 more points per 100 possessions since Johnson has joined, and since he’s playing about 32 minutes per game, I think its safe to assume he has something to do with that. The team is defending at a slightly worse rate but not so much worse that it is reason to worry. Additionally, many of the players on the court with Johnson are good defenders, making it easier to hide him. For example, the lineup that Johnson has played in the most includes Luol Deng, Goran Dragic, Johnson, Amar’e Stoudemire, and Dwyane Wade. Three of those five players are plus defenders in a big way. When guarded by Dragic, Stoudemire, and Wade, players shoot 4.8%, 4.8%, and 2.4% worse than their averages, respectively. Putting Johnson on the weakest offensive perimeter player mitigates his risk and also saves his energy for offense.What is Johnson personally doing that has made his short time with the Heat so successful? One thing jumps out to me more than any other, three-point shooting.Since February 27th, the second most common offensive play run by Johnson is a “spot-up.” NBA.com defines a spot up as a play that ends with a catch and shoot or a catch and drive. See that blistering 58.6% 3-point shooting number up there? All 29 of Johnson’s three point attempts since he’s joined the Heat have come in spot-up situations. This means he’s being placed on the wing while a play is being run, the defense collapses on the paint, and Johnson is there for a wide-open shot. His current role with the Heat is actually very reminiscent of other players in recent years such as Ray Allen, James Jones, and Shane Battier. Johnson will undoubtedly regress to the mean in terms of his shooting percentage but its not unrealistic to assume he could shoot over 40% from three for the rest of the season, that would put him near top-20 in the league.Another valuable piece of Johnson’s game is his ability to generate his own shot. Over the years, this has earned him the nickname “Iso Joe”. It hasn’t always been a great thing in terms of team basketball, but having a reliable scorer to give the ball to with 8 seconds left on the shot clock is very important in the playoffs. Isolations account for slightly less than 11% of Johnson’s offensive possessions since joining the Heat, which is a good thing; ideally an offense should emphasize ball movement and motion instead of isolation. However, when you’re averaging 1.08 points per possession in those scenarios, the team can live with it from time to time.Too Little Too Late?Ultimately we won’t know Johnson’s true impact until the playoffs roll around in the coming weeks. Does he make the Heat a better team right now? Absolutely. His veteran leadership and offensive abilities are what made him coveted by a title-ready team like Cleveland. Personally I don’t think this moves the needle for Miami in terms of beating the Cavs and competing for a title, especially with Chris Bosh’s current health concerns. But, he does make the playoffs much more interesting. If Bosh is able to return at 100%, a second round Miami/Cleveland matchup could create a lot more fireworks than people in The Land would like.http://www.thelombardian.com/who-says-no/2016/3/17/0gyvehrypttzaf9610hyr78e3xcigv",http://reddit.com/r/nba/comments/4bse5x/c/d1bywhi,1458838953,nba,[OC] Can Joe Johnson Spark the Heat?,125,4bse5x,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/4bse5x,1458777600

But yeah, cool how you deleted your comment like a little pussy.",2,"I find it curious that the two teams he coached (New Orleans and OKC) fell apart so quickly after he left. I know that he had a great reputation with Portland, which helped land him the job in New Orleans. He also seems to be highly regarded by his coaching peers and the team USA staff. However, his reputation seemed to fall apart fairly quickly in New Orleans, as many Pelicans fans blamed him for his offensive system and not getting Anthony Davis enough touches. Well, even with the injuries, New Orleans has been a disaster since he left and it looks like Monty made the best of a bad situation.Soon afterwards, he goes to OKC as an assistant coach, and though the beginning was a bit rough, it looked like OKC was improving both their offense and defense over the course of the year. Then, Monty's wife tragically passed away, and Monty understandably takes the rest of the season off. Now, OKC looks extremely inconsistent and has lost more games than they've won since he's left.Hopefully, Monty takes time off to grieve, recuperate, and help his family recover. Afterwards though, I'm very curious to see if he lands another head coaching gig, because it looks like he was a fairly critical part in his team's success.",http://reddit.com/r/nba/comments/4a2h4i/c/d0wwx72,1457762022,nba,Is Monty Williams a coaching genius?,21,4a2h4i,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/4a2h4i,1457740800

3671,"Close games, come backs, game winners, etc are all exciting. ",1,"I don't know about you, but the last few minutes of the 4th quarter aren't exactly the most exciting when a team starts intentionally fouling players to the line so that they can come back and shoot a 3 pointer. The game also gets extended way too long (the last 3 minutes sometimes can take over 20 minutes to finish). I think of the other Big 4 sports and their time management of the game: NHL has three scheduled TV timeouts/period and each team only has one 30 second timeout/game. The end of the game goes by just as fast as any other interval. MLB just introduced Pace of Play rules to shorten time between pitching and inning changes. I feel the NBA needs to address this issue of intentional fouls, by either issuing some sort of foul (1 free throw + possession) for fouls in the backcourt near the end of the game or a foul (1 FT + possession) for fouls the ref deems as ""intentional"". This would hopefully speed the end of the game up and force teams to not intentionally foul players and just play normally but at a higher intensity.",http://reddit.com/r/nba/comments/48qt7m/c/d0lrri7,1456987932,nba,To change or not to change intentional fouling at the end of the game?

3676,Remember when the #8 seed Warriors upset the #1 seed insanely good Mavericks. Could happen the other way around ��,6,"So with all the talk of the Warriors ending up as an alltime great team, the Spurs are right on their back and getting their pieces to click more and more. With the inevitable WCF matchup between these two (OKC and LAC will definitely have something to say about that, but there are question marks with the Thunder's consistency and how Griffin's return will help or possibly hurt the Clips) on many peoples' minds, the Warriors are rightfully considered the favorite in this matchup. However, we all know Pop's tendency to withhold his team's best plans until actually matching up in the playoffs, and this is likely the most all-around talented Spurs team we've seen in a long time while still maintaining much of their depth theyve relied on for the past few years. I still think the Warriors win in a close 7 games, but you never count out the Spurs.So the question is, if the Spurs pull off a victory against the Dubs, will it really be considered an upset? One one hand, it will definitely look odd that this team which has been constantly compared and held to the standards of the 96 Bulls ended up not even making the Finals (obviously context matters. the WCF is likely the true finals this year, but still). On the other hand, it isnt like they lost to some scrubs. Spurs on pace for 70 wins, all time great defense, GOAT coach, elite offensive system, have arguably the best perimeter defender in the game (whose offense has made him a consensus top 10 player) and arguably the best rim protector. They have the marquee free agent from the last offseason who has bought into the system while still knowing when to be aggressive. Veteran leadership, discipline, and toughness mixed with top heavy talent and crazy depth. How would history look back on this series/season if this was to happen?

People bash coaches of bad teams when they say they prioritize winning over development, but when a coach makes a move like this that is strictly about development, everyone comes out to bash him for that too.

Porzingis is the most important player on the Knicks by far. Nothing else on their roster really matters at this point. For him to reach his potential, he has to be unguardable by smaller players in the post. If you let teams go small against him, it puts you at a huge disadvantage defensively.

If you can't see that then your either not trying to see it or just a scorned fan which I was with Kevin Love. ,-2,"Starters:Knight -- Curry (Great shooting/scoring point guards who can play off the ball)Middleton -- Thompson (obvious)Parker -- Barnes (athletic 3/4 slashers and shooters, before Barnes's recent slump and Parker's hot streak they were averaging near identical numbers -- around 12/5 -- obviously Parker has more potential)Giannis -- Green (two big do-it-all point fowards)Sanders -- Bogut (shot-blocking, defensive glue centers)Bench:Bayless -- Clark (scoring/shooting bench PGs)Mayo -- Barbosa (spark plug shooting guards, but a bit more than that)Dudley -- Iguodala (glue SFs who can do a bit of everything)Ilyasova -- Speights (tall defensive sieves who shoot a lot and have great per36 stats)Pachulia -- Varejao (defensive non-blocking glue centers)Call it a shitpost if you will, but the parallels were present at the time and they're becoming more and more obvious as the Bucks players improve.

&gt;has 3 best teams in NBA",2,"I've noticed all of the Steph Curry craze and he's having the best offensive season ever, so I'm up to date with that. I also know that LeBron went back to Cleveland, but lost in the finals. But what the fuck is going on with the rest of the league?Why are the East standings so close near the bottom? The Pacers, Pistons, Hornets, and Bulls basically all have the same record. I thought the Bulls were supposed to be the second best in the East? Why is the West so bad now near the bottom? I remember the Suns had almost 50 wins awhile back and barely missed the playoffs, but now they suck and the 8th seed isn't even above .500. Also, don't the Rockets have James Harden and Dwight Howard? Why the hell are they so bad?The Grizzlies and Mavs were my favorite teams to watch before, but what the fuck is this shit? I just looked up the Grizzlies roster and they have Matt Barnes, Lance Stephenson, Mario Chalmers, and Birdman now. Did they make a terrible trade with Miami or something? I don't get how this team is 5th in the West. Also, I saw Dallas doesn't have one of my favorite players anymore (Monta Ellis), which makes me sad. I watched highlights of one of their games recently and they had like three point guards and Wes Matthews playing power forward. Are they going full small-ball now or something?How does Boston have the third best record in the East? I glanced at their roster and don't recognize a single player besides that 5'5"" Isaiah Thomas dude who used to be on the Kings right?Why are Golden State and San Antonio ridiculously good now? I know Curry has been great, but holy shit their record is insane. And shouldn't Oklahoma City be much better with the players on their roster? Russell Westbrook and Kevin Durant seem healthy, and they also have Dion Waiters now, who used to be pretty good in Cleveland with Kyrie.Can you guys fill me in on some of this stuff?TL:DR - haven't watched NBA in over a year and need some people to fill me in on what's going on",http://reddit.com/r/nba/comments/48jofj/c/d0k40kq,1456880830,nba,"New to reddit, haven't watched NBA in over a year.

Happened in the NFL with Rodger Saffold. Raiders way over-payed for him in FA, after getting based in the media, it is strongly rumored the doctors were told to fail his physical.",1,"Credit it to /u/Pliumbum for finding this:So I saw this interview in Lithuanian media and I thought I would translate it. Should be interesting. Original link: http://www.basketnews.lt/news-95179-donatas-motiejunas-trauma-buvo-tik-pretekstas-pistons-atsisakyti-mainu.html– How do you feel being back on court?– Well, it’s not my first game back, I played in D-League, but it’s really pleasant being back on the Rockets roster and I hope I can help the team more. – What was the situation after the trade with Pistons? – The medical examination is a funny thing. The team doctor simply says whether you pass or don’t, although they may not even do any checks. Those 48 hours actually just let the team decide whether they want you or not. The Pistons announced I did not pass the medical, although I surely did pass it and played even before it. I just got ‘screwed’. The injury was a pretense to call off the trade. They changed their minds. – Did you want to play in Detroit? – Whether I wanted or not, the trade happened, so I started concentrating on playing there, but we all saw what happened. I was in Detroit, I stayed with the team for 3-4 days. I saw the practice, I did other stuff. – How serious is your back injury, truth be told? – Now everything is fine. During the All Star break I worked with a back specialist in Vancouver. When the season ends I will most likely go there again to work some more. As much as I talked to doctors and saw the photos, there is nothing serious, all problems are temporary. – So you are not afraid there is something serious?– So far I do not feel anything. Everything’s alright. Some things are really tiresome – I have come to the arena to warm up much earlier, but now it has to become part of my life. – The Rockets wanted to trade you, but now you are staying in Houston. It looks like some sort of misunderstanding? – I wouldn’t call it that. The Rockets were not giving me away for free, they got a high draft pick. A high pick is very useful, so I completely understand them. From my side, I see it as a business. I know they did not want to give me away and offered many other players to the Pistons, but the guys in Detroit wanted only me.
Now I will be talking to my agent and lawyers to clarify what to do next. The Pistons had access to my full medical history, so they shouldn’t have done what they did to me. They decreased my value. The medical examination I ‘failed’ was a joke. The Pistons will have some explaining to do why they did not want the trade anymore. We will see what happens. – What keeps you up at night at the moment? – How to help the team reach the playoffs and go as far as possible once there. I am not preoccupied about raising my value, because I play basketball for the love of the game and not for money. Sooner or later the money will come, but you may only win the ring once or twice in your career. – Don’t you think it would be useful for you to play some more in the D-League? – I played four games there, I spent the All Star weekend working and I really feel I am not in such a bad shape. I think I’ll stay where I am. It seems the coach also wants me here. – How do you deal with all the ups and downs in Houston? – That’s life. You either give up, or you dust yourself off and go further. I stayed in the gym 8 to 5 for three or four months. I will regain my shape. I need just some patience and some consistent work. Of course you can want everything immediately, but that does not happen.– It seems your reaction to the situation is much calmer than when you used to stay on the bench in your first seasons? – My reaction is calmer, because I know I am still not in my best shape. I will still need a lot of time in the gym to regain it, and I will fight back for my minutes. – Is there a chance of seeing you in the national team? – We will see. It will very much depend on how I will feel now and how the team ends the season. As I said, I will be going to Vancouver as well, then we will see what my schedule is. I will also become a restricted free agent, so there’s that. There are many circumstances at play here.-""Enterprising Reddit User""",http://reddit.com/r/nba/comments/48af5r/c/d0iqcru,1456791365,nba,Motiejunas to Lithuania media: The physical I failed was a joke.

I've heard it said that a lot of players get routine debridements in the offseason as well, it just doesn't get reported because of how minor it is.

In the case of NBA players, part of it probably is their training. Ignore anyone who tells you that the NBA actually has ""state of the art"" trainers and the like.

4067,"There are a TON of problems with this.  Lets break it down a little bit.  

* the majority of contact fouls are a gray area anyway.  The majority of complaints about these calls aren't ""that was/wasn't a foul"" but more along the lines of ""call it the same on both ends or don't call it"".  So what is the point of reviewing these?  

* Goaltending should be reviewed anyway, just like 3 pointers are if a foot is near the line.  Have the ref signal that it will be reviewed at the next break in time, and review it.  These are worth 2 points generally, which is double the value of whether a shot was a 3 pointer or not, so I don't see why these aren't reviewed.  

* What happens when a make-up call is called for review?  Now the refs just have to make another makeup call

* Refs already review the first half's calls during halftime.  This is where a few makeup calls come from 

* I think people underestimate how much the refs can influence a game.  Not only are most games decided by a very small margin, but these calls can influence attitude and future behavior.  Having a couple of challenges in a giant fucking ocean of bad calls isn't going to change anything.  

my .02",1,"In the NFL, if a flag is thrown you have the opportunity to challenge the penalty call once per game.  The NBA has a different approach in which most types of calls are not reviewable until the final two minutes of the game.But I think it would be an interesting change if teams were given maybe two or three challenges per game.  This would improve a number of aspects about the game:The whining over bad calls would be severely reduced.  If you're THAT sure that it was a bad call, challenge the call.  Otherwise, shut up and play.The integrity of the officiating would also improve, I think.  Bad calls are part of the game, but this would make the fanbase a lot more pleased with the officiating.  Just look at what adding a challenge has done to baseball officiating.  IMO baseball game calling has improved dramatically after adding a challenge system.There wouldn't be a huge hit to game duration if there's only a few challenges allowed.  If each team got 2 challenges, that's at most 10 extra minutes of reviewing calls, assuming all four are used.Just interested in what you all think.",http://reddit.com/r/nba/comments/49p6c5/c/d0tmf1z,1457547072,nba,"Do you think that adding a ""challenge"" system to the NBA would improve the game or make it worse?",7,49p6c5,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/49p6c5,1457481600

4073,"It definitely isn't ""which team do you take in a playoff series"", but it pretty much is ""which team do you take in a game right now"". 

You can look far and wide, and won't find a concrete definition for Power Rankings, so you can't really be wrong, but in my opinion it is a ranking of how good you think teams are *right now*, not how they were for the last x days. 

If you accept that conclusion (if you don't, I am curious what you think we are ranking), it follows that how you would expect a team to perform in their next game is more important how they were in their last few, as their last few are subject to a lot of randomness (not to mention SOS, touch scheduling, things like illness, etc.)

When I rank teams I ask myself, ""which team would I expect to have a better point differential against a hypothetical average NBA team on neutral court, if the game was played tonight"".

4087,Indiana and Detroit. Sorry man :(,3,"At first glance, it may appear that the Western Conference, with all its superstar (All-NBA) players, is far better than the Eastern Conference. After all, they have the 2 best teams in the NBA and 4 of the top 6. However, when you take a deeper look something quickly becomes apparent: the Eastern Conference has just as many (if not more) quality teams as the Western Conference.Even though the West is on pace to have 4 teams finish the season with 50 or more wins, as opposed to the East's 2 teams, the East is on pace to have all 8 of its playoff teams finish the season well above .500. The same cannot be said for the West, however; they are on pace to have two teams at or below .500 make the playoffs. The last time the West had two or more playoff teams at or below .500 make the playoffs was 1996-97 (back when the West's bottom 3 seeds all had losing records), nearly 20 years ago.With the Golden State Warriors and San Antonio Spurs both having historic seasons in the West, of course the lower playoffs seeds will be worse off (side-note: This very well may be the first season in NBA history where two teams in the league, let alone the same conference, both finish the season with winning percentages above .800)! Besides, West teams are still beating the East teams, right?As I am typing this, East teams are a combined 205-220 (.482) against West team. Inversely, West teams are a combined 220-205 (.518) against East teams. With over 94% of inter-conference games already played, it's likely that the win percentage margin between the East and the West stays below 2% (the largest margin possible at this point is 4.4%). Wherever this margin falls in the 0-4.4% range, it'll be the lowest since 2008-09 When the East (231-219, .513) and the West (219-231, .487) had a win percentage margin of about 2.67% in the East's favor.Now that we've seen how the all combined teams in each conference compare to another, let's focus on individual teams, more specifically playoff teams. There are currently 9 teams in the East with a record at or above .500 vs. the West (Cavs, Raptors, Hawks, Heat, Celtics, Hornets, Pacers, Pistons, Bulls), including all 8 playoff teams. Moving to the West, there are currently 7 teams in the West with a record at or above .500 vs. the West (Warriors, Spurs, Thunder, Clippers, Grizzlies, Jazz, Nuggets), only 6 of which are playoff teams.With all the information I have presented above, I hope we redditors can have a meaningful discussion on the state of the two NBA conferences.

4092,"&gt; I sound like someone who has seen this guy bounce around the league his entire career

You're talking like someone who is basing his current performance on the Beasley you remember when he played for the heat. It's obvious you've barely watched him play in Rockets red 

&gt; It's why even when Houston wins he often ends with a negative +/-. 

Lol dude, +\- is such a cherry picked stat and an arbitrary one at that when you play off the bench with a bench squad that sucks ass. For the most part, with a few exceptions, he's on the court when Harden is off of it. And when Harden is out we do terribly 

&gt; As I said, his scoring is an asset, but it's his only asset.

Aaaaand we need that scoring desperately. If you actually watched the rockets for once instead of basing your opinions on prior history or stat sheets, you would know that Beasley shooting 10 times a game is MUCH better than Brewer shooting those shots or Josh Smith chunking up ill advised three pointers. His scoring is a huge asset! If it was his only skill, that would be totally fine.

But again, next time watch a few rockets games before making your assumptions, because since he's been here scoring hasn't been his only asset...he's actually been playing well defensively, and playing with a lot of energy on both ends of the court",1,through a 1 minute analysis of michael beasley's games since joining the rockets i've made the conclusion that michael beasley is houston's saviour. ,http://reddit.com/r/nba/comments/4ckj5i/c/d1k19l8,1459396610,nba,"When Michael Beasley plays under 25 minutes, Rockets are 2-5.

4128,lmfao i was taken for a ruse,23,"SOURCE: https://youtu.be/DJ2SWCu3T8wWell-done DownToBuck, all credit goes to youDevin Booker knew he wasn't really supposed to be near the visitors' locker room.He also knew that this was perhaps his last chance to meet his idol, Kobe Bryant. Given the circumstances, Devin thought he should be allowed a little leeway in terms of where he was and wasn't supposed to be.He had never been to this part of the arena and was a little lost; he wandered around for a little while when an unexpected, yet completely familiar, voice spoke from behind him. ""Looking for me?""Devin turned around to see Kobe standing in the corridor, smiling in his usual Kobe way. Now that Devin was face-to-face with the man himself, he found himself starstruck. He swallowed. ""Yeah.""""It's better that we chat here. Fewer people,"" Kobe said. Devin nodded. He hadn't seen another person for several minutes until Kobe had appeared. The locker room he had been trying to locate was probably a long ways off. ""Yeah,"" he repeated. ""Man, it's crazy to think that you were playing in the NBA when I wasn't even born.""Kobe chuckled. ""Yeah, a little crazy.""""How do you do it? How did you stay so good for so long?"" Devin asked. ""And don't tell me about hard work, I know all about that.""Glancing around to reassure himself that nobody was around, Kobe leaned in a little closer. ""I can tell you, but it can't be out here.""There was a door to Devin's left. He was so eager to hear Kobe's words of wisdom that he didn't at all care what might be behind it; it turned out to be a mostly-empty janitorial closet. ""We could go in here,"" he suggested.""That works,"" Kobe said, shrugging. The two basketball players walked through the door and closed it behind them. A light switch was found and flipped on, illuminating the bare fluorescent bulb on the ceiling. ""Now, I'm only sharing my secrets because I think you're something special. Really special. Maybe the next Kobe."" Kobe chuckled again as he referred to himself in the third person.""I don't know about that,"" Devin replied bashfully.""Maybe you don't know now. But you will,"" Kobe said, adopting a serious tone of voice. ""Now listen up. The secret to my success is...""Devin was so focused on listening to Kobe's words that when Kobe's torso exploded outward, showering Devin with flecks of blood and bone, Devin could think of nothing except how he hadn't even gotten to hear the secret. He was soon brought back to reality by the sight of some sort of alien creature crawling out of the hole that had been created in Kobe's chest. Kobe, meanwhile, had fallen against the wall and lay slumped there, all life absent from his eyes.Devin backed as far away as he could. Somehow, in his surprise, it never occurred to him to simply open the door and leave. ""What are you?"" he asked, staring in repulsion at the three-foot-tall being who possessed four clawed legs and purple glasslike scales all across its body.""I am Kobe,"" answered the creature in a voice that seemed not to be transmitted through the air but instead inserted directly into Devin's auditory cortex. ""And if you want to be the next Kobe, you will allow me to use your body as a host.""""A...host?"" ""Kobe's body was failing. It could no longer support me,"" explained the alien, who did not seem to have eyes or a head to speak of. ""Your body is young and fresh.""""What if I don't want to host an alien in my body?"" Devin asked defiantly.There was the briefest of pauses before the alien replied, ""that's not really an option."" With frightening quickness, it leaped off the floor with two of its legs extended outward, obviously intending to pin Devin against the wall. Devin instinctively ducked, rolled, and ran to the opposite corner, near where Kobe's sundered body lay motionless.As the alien recovered its footing, Devin looked desperately around him for anything that might help him. Spotting a jug of bleach, he removed the cap and splashed some of the strong-smelling liquid on the creature. The effect was immediate, and the closet was filled with the sound of glass shattering as the creature's scales turned a violet red color before breaking and falling off.""You will die for your resistance!"" announced the creature, who again launched itself at Devin, this time connecting with the human's chest. Devin cried out in pain as he felt his lung punctured by a needle-pointed alien claw, but he overcame the pain to toss some more bleach on the exposed, scaleless areas of the alien's skin.""No! Fool! Do you not want to be the next Kobe?"" screamed the alien as it fell to the ground and shuddered, clearly mortally wounded.""Yo, you learn a lot from Kobe?"" asked a teammate as Devin walked back into the locker room.Devin wiped a spot of blood off his face. ""Yeah. Kinda.""",http://reddit.com/r/nba/comments/4bt56i/c/d1c6vt1,1458849565,nba,Devin Booker's Meeting with Kobe Bryant,194,4bt56i,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/4bt56i,1458777600

4207,Dude until Curry this year Durant was the only player to hit 30 ppg for the past 7 seasons. There's no way.,7,"MJ's Wizards tenure is seen by many as somewhat of a blemish on his unparalleled legacy. On september 25th 2001, at the age of 38 and 7 months, the GOAT announced his second comeback as a member of the Washington Wizards - just a few months after he broke a couple ribs during a pickup game in Chicago. After winning just 19 games the previous season, the Wizards were off to a lousy start, being 5-12 and going on a terrible 8 game losing streak before hitting their stride and winning 9 in a row. Unfortunately, 8 games into the streak Rip Hamilton - the Wizards 2nd best player at this point - would suffer a groin injury and would miss about 5 weeks and the Wizards would end up going 8-9 without him. Immediately following Hamilton's return on January 31st, the 21-21 Wizards would go on a 5 game winning streak - things were looking up. The Wizards had won their last 13 games that had both MJ and Hamilton on the court. Unfortunately the 38 year old Jordan was battling a chronic knee injury 1 2 3 that was aggravated in a collision with Etan Thomas in his 46th game which effectively ended his season - though he tried to play through it for several games. Immediately after the injury the 26-21 (.553 winning % .565 with Jordan) Wizards would go 1-9 in their next 10 games and 11-24 (a .314 winning %) for the remainder of the season and would finish with a 37-45 record and MJ would only end up playing a total of 60 games.Now, out of curiosity I decided to take a look at MJ's game logs for the season, specifically pre and post-injury and as the season advanced, and what I found out was quite interesting. For the whole 2001-02 season, Jordan averaged :22.9 PPG 5.7 RPG 5.2 APG .416 FG% .790 FT% However, for his first 46 (pre-injury) games, he averaged:25.1 PPG 6.2 RPG 5.3 APG .420 FG% .790 FT% in 36.8 MPGAnd his last 14 (post-injury) games, he averaged:15.7 PPG 3.8 RPG 4.8 APG .391 FG% .787 FT% in 28.4 MPGWhat I found most interesting though is that as the season progressed and MJ played himself into shape and shook off the 3 year retirement rust - he was playing better and better.For his last 20 games pre-injury he averaged :27.5 PPG 6.4 RPG 5.2 APG .440 FG%And for his last 10 games pre-injury he averaged a blistering :29.7 PPG 6.6 RPG 6.1 APG .470 FG%Those are some crazy, crazy numbers for a dude who at this point was a month or two away from being 39 years old. Had Jordan and Hamilton both stayed healthy I honestly believe the Wizards might've won 48-50 games and made some noise in the playoffs on the back of a fucking 39 year old. Amazing.The Wizards went from having won 19 games the year before to a potential Playoff contender that was derailed by injuries with their offseason additions being:38,5 year old Michael Jordan - ended up only playing 60 games and starting 53 due to injuryTyronn Lue - 20 mpg, 8 PPG 3.5 APGRookie Kwame Brown - 14 mpg, 4.5 PPG 3.5 RPGRookie Brendan Haywood - 14 mpg, 5 PPG 5 RPGRookie Etan Thomas - 13 mpg, 4 PPG 4 RPGRookie Bobby Simmons - 11 mpg, 4PPG 2RPG",http://reddit.com/r/nba/comments/4alpmz/c/d11nn5t,1458106139,nba,A look at Michael Jordan's 2001-02 season,164,4alpmz,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/4alpmz,1458086400

When a player like Lebron James kills it on the court, he also kills it off the court. Revenue from brand endorsement, shoe deals, and alone could probably sustain players for years to come. I was curious about what happens when a player suffers from a poor season, an injury, or even a rough patch --- do they still sell as many shoes? I read today in an article I found (http://www.kicksusa.com/basketball-shoes-sales-data/) that when Kyrie Irving was injured during a long stretch in the 2014-2015 season, his shoe sales dropped incredibly. However, even a player like Kevin Durant saw an incredible drop in shoe sales as the NBA season kicked off in October of 2015 and sales didn’t increase until December. And a player like Kobe Bryant actually makes more money as he approaches retirement, even after a stagnant few months. So what gives? When a player does well on the court, does he earn a substantial amount of more money, or does it depend on the particular player? If the player is a general superstar, does it matter if he's going through a rough patch, or will he still earn a substantial amount of revenue from sneaker deals alone?

He constantly does platoon rotations when we have one of the worst benches in the league. He can't draw up a play for shit and he fails to make changes on the go. He is literally infuriating. 

Teams like Utah and Portland are perfect examples of what teams can do with good coaching. Getting guys to play at a high level each and every night. This dude plays Tyus fucking Jones for like 24 minutes against one of the best point guards in the NBA and he thinks we shouldn't get blown out?

Whatever you think of Simmons, he made the history of the NBA funny and argumentive for me. Man, I laughed at that book so many times I can't count. It made me respect Kobe and LeBron, made me rate Bill Russell too high on my all timers list and reinforced my faith in the Basketball Jesus. 2014-2015 (IT on) Boston Celtics.

4282,"Several people have done graphs like this comparing the Warriors' pace to the 1996 Bulls, and a couple other teams. Missing in those visualizations, however, are also:

* Other top teams, like the 1997 Bulls, the 1972 Lakers, and the 1973 Celtics, the only four teams in NBA history to finish with 68 or more wins in an 82-game season (notably, though, the Sixers did it in a shorter season in 1967).
* Comparison to the more typical ""best"" teams in a league in a given year. Comparing only to the 1996 Bulls loses a sense of how historically amazing this performance is.
* Inclusion of the Spurs, who are similarly on pace to become a number of the 68 win club.
* Simple projections based on current records of what the final records will be.

So, I assembled this chart: I added the 2016 Spurs for their record-setting pace; the 1997 Bulls, the 1972 Lakers, and the 1973 Celtics for historical context; and the 2016 Raptors, 2016 Thunder , and 2016 Cavaliers for present context. My hope is that this graph shows both (a) how far ahead of the typical good team the Spurs and Warriors are, and (b) the absurdity of their seasons occurring at the same time.

Worth noting: I chose the teams to include based solely on (a) best final record and (b) best current record. I'm sure there are teams that, through 60ish games, were close to the Warriors' and Spurs' pace, but that dropped off. This likely explains the gap between the Warriors/Spurs and the Cavaliers/Raptors/Thunder (as well as the Cavaliers/Raptors/Thunder being on pace for high-50s in wins, while most seasons have a team in the low 60s).

4290,Not Cousins either ,3,"Is it just because of our team's record? Westbrook, LeBron, and Kawhi are not better than Harden. Only Curry and KD are better than him IMO.He's putting up 28.7 ppg, 6.4 rpg, 7.0 apg, 60% TS while carrying his dumpster fire of a team to a .500 record and the 9th best offensive efficiency in the league. His individual numbers are actually better than last year's when he was an MVP candidate, but it's not his fault the entire team is playing terribly.I know he's a lazy defender, but he's actually good when he tries, like last night when he played great D on Jrue Holiday in a close game. Westbrook and LeBron are also lazy defenders this year, but why do they get a pass when they have better players on their team? Harden is also a much more efficient scorer than either Westbrook or LeBron by a significant margin.Harden: 28.7 PPG on 59.6 TS%Westbrook: 24.3 PPG on 55.9 TS%LeBron: 24.9 PPG on 57.1 TS%The only other player who can be considered better is Kawhi Leonard, but it's hard to say that when the entire Spurs team is just good. Kawhi scores more efficiently, but on much less volume, and he also has never carried an entire offense like Harden does. Yeah he's a good defender, but offense is much more valuable and Harden is a generational scorer.Every time that somebody brings up Westbrook/LeBron/Kawhi are better than Harden, they go to RPM/BPM or win shares, which are all team-oriented stats. It's not like Harden can't lead a team by himself.

4294,"I don't think it was luck at all, though, like I said, my memory of their run remains hazy. Roy Williams is a heck of a coach and this was basically just a prototypically great college squad. No one could outbang May and his lack of athleticism and height wasn't as damning against college players. McCants probably benefited from general lack of others' height/athleticism being 6'4"". And Williams length and athleticism covered up his inability to do anything exceptionally well (off topic, but I think ATL is largely to blame for his professional mediocrity). Felton was the lone true talent IMO but suffered from poorly run Bobcats and Nuggets organizations and then succumbed to his own craziness. 

That's all neither here nor there because I'm not arguing these dudes didn't suck as a whole professionally. Other than Felton, none of them had the game suited for the League. What I'm asking is why didn't Jawad get the same look McCants and Williams did *that night* when McCants and Williams had similar question marks going into the draft and McCants stats weren't significantly better than Jawad's? And Jawad had four inches on Rashad. Why didn't Jawad ride the same title wave to being overvalued and overdrafted?

(Maybe it's nostalgia for a time I was more interested in the NBA but for some reason all these years later this Tar Heels team is extremely interesting to me. It was the perfect storm of collegiate talent, professional lack of it, and overhyped ego.)",5,"The past few days I've been reading about various busts out of boredom and I happened across a string of 2005 Tar Heel threads/blogs. I vaguely remember that championship run and seem to recall much excitement during the subsequent historic draft, which of course saw four players from one school taken in the lottery.In the course of these recent readings, a few commented on the talent and collegiate impact of Jawad Williams, especially in reference to the professional failings of McCants and, to a lesser extent, Marvin Williams. However, Jawad is a player that I do not instantly remember (to be fair I was never a big UNC fan and, at most, passive NCAA viewer). Looking at stats, he put up around 13/1/4 in 2004. While not blowing anyone away also not far off from 14th overall pick McCants' 16/3/3 (though McCants had a more impressive sophomore scoring showing). At the time, DraftExpress noted he struggled with handles and intensity but defended well, ran the court well, and was extremely athletic.Obviously, this may be a case of people, years later, overselling J. William's potential at the time (especially in the face of a discussion about known busts), but it still seems odd roughly a decade later why a seemingly significant component of an historic NCAA team was left completely out in the cold that night. Was it severe pre-draft concerns? He was older as a 4 year Sr. but McCants was only about a year younger and I don't think the extreme youth movement had taken over the League at that point.(Fwiw, it turns out J. Will did get a short run in the NBA between the Clips and Cavs and flamed out quickly, perhaps settling any debate about what his potential could have been, but I still think it's an interesting situation. Heck, the 2005 Heels are case study interesting as a whole.)",http://reddit.com/r/nba/comments/4bkcib/c/d19wv89,1458695616,nba,Why didn't Jawad Williams get much of a look in the '05 draft?,6,4bkcib,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/4bkcib,1458691200

4310,"I like that /r/nba is very questioning and for the most part doesn't really tolerate misinformed content, hot takes, or low quality posts. If you come here with a low content post, you can pretty much count on there being a comment calling out the bullshit and offering up reasons or stats why someone is wrong. Well researched posts and comments are appreciated here, but at the same time there's comments offering differing opinions that add to the conversation as well.  There are definitely subjective opinions on here that I disagree with, but hardly ever anything highly upvoted that's objectively wrong. If I could change something, I think discussion would be better if more people would concede that they are wrong or that they don't know sometimes when someone points out their take is wrong. This applies to beliefs that people have about their own team as well as opinions about teams they don't really watch but still refuse to change their stance.

4327,"Ok after 3+ watches and some basketball thinking, I'm officially on board w/ this as a viable coaching strategy. If nothing else, it allows for interesting substitutions to counter hack-a-shaq as a strategy. If I'm Doc in the playoffs and someone intentionally fouls DeAndre in the 3rd quarter, I'm using this as a response and going super small to force a timeout or (hopefully) run in transition until a dead ball. 

EDIT: Note that in the DET/HOU game a while back HOU intentionally fouled 5 times to start the quarter to get hack-a-shaq started and get Drummond out of the game. If Van Gundy had subbed out using an intentional lane violation we would have been able to play the entire quarter in the bonus and shut down the hack-a-shaq strategy at the same time. ",5,"Initially it looked like Stan called a timeout as he was shooting it, which invalidated the free throw and allowed him to substitute in Baynes. I've never seen that before, it was ruled as a lane violation but it honestly seemed intentional. I wonder if Stan is instructing a guy to intentionally lane-violate in that situation to cause a dead ball and get Andre out of the game without using a timeout. It's ingenious regardless of whether or not it is intentional. Happened at 1:45 in the third quarter. Discuss?http://stats.nba.com/game/#!/0021501058/playbyplay/#play364~
http://stats.nba.com/game/#!/0021501058/playbyplay/#play365~Edit: Watched it again - Baynes had his warmups off when Andre shot it, and Stanley was a solid 2 steps in the lane when the ball was released, but there was no camera on SVG during the stretch. Baynes probably was ready to come in at the next dead-ball anyways. As for this as a strategy - I'm not sure how viable it may be, but hopefully some statheads can comment. Is 0.34 points worth a free substitution? What if it allows you to go defense for offense or go small to force an opposition timeout substitution?",http://reddit.com/r/nba/comments/4bqnbq/c/d1biuis,1458804619,nba,What happened tonight w/ Andre's second hack-a-shaq free throw?,20,4bqnbq,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/4bqnbq,1458777600

4360,they do. that's why the term high volume scorer exist ,1,"Hey fellas, idk if anyone gives a shit about this at all, and the beginning part is a little dumbed-down, but here's a homework assignment/project I did that I figured I might as well post to /r/nba. Here goes.   As the seasons go on, LeBron James keeps making his case for being one of the top players in NBA history. ""Experts"" at ESPN voted LeBron as the third best player of all time, behind Kareem Abdul-Jabbar at #2 and Michael Jordan at #1. While there will always be skeptics, if LeBron James was able to surpass Michael Jordan and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar in scoring, it would certainly help his legacy. LeBron currently sits at #13 on the NBA's all time scoring list with a total of 26,455 total points, while Michael Jordan is 4th with 32,292 total points, and Kareem is number one all time with a grand total of 38,387 points. What I want to find out is if LeBron could surpass either Jordan or Kareem, and how long it would take him to do so. I decided to do this using a linear regression model.  There are a few factors to consider:  LeBron has played 62/65 games this year. There are 17 games left in the season. Because LeBron is currently averaging 24.9 points per game, I chose to multiply that by 17 and add it to his total points for this year. However, he might not play all the remaining games due to injury or rest, and will likely not continue to average exactly 24.9 points per game.  No one can play forever. Most players will play to around 40 at the most. With all the extra playoff, olympic, and all star games LeBron participates in, he ends up playing a lot more than most players. I can't imagine even an incredible athlete like LeBron playing past forty, so I am making that the limit for how long he can play when making these calculations.  While a linear regression equation should be able to make a relatively accurate prediction of how much LeBron will decline, it won't know there were only 66 games played in the 2012 season due to a lockout, which might affect the prediction.  There are a number of things that can happen with LeBron that the linear regression model simply can't predict. LeBron could become a better shooter, be affected by injuries, or have a new role with a team, all of which would likely affect his point totals.The linear regression model gives us an equation of y=2105.620879X-4217537.89.  I first decided to plug in Michael Jordan's point total into Y because it is the smaller value. It predicts LeBron could reach Jordan's point total in 2018, which is when LeBron will only be 33, so unless something drastic happens, he should pass Jordan.     Next, I plugged in Kareem's point total. The linear regression equation gives us the year of 2021 for when LeBron should pass Kareem. LeBron would only be 36 then, so passing Kareem should certainly be doable as well.

They went from winning all but two titles from 1989-1998 to this stretch where they were derided annually in and before the Finals.Why was it so disrespected? It's not like the East had scrubs, but in the eyes of the media, it sure occasionally felt like that. Iverson, T-Mac, Kidd, Milwaukee's Big Three, Celtics that one year with Pierce and Walker, Bird's Pacers- they were putting on some good displays of watchable hoops.Spurs and Lakers- How much of the East's inability to win the title was solely because of them? Would things have been much different if, say, the Timberwolves played the Pistons in 2004 or the Kings played the Nets in 2002 or the Blazers faced Indiana in 2000?

In fact, Golden State last year was the first NBA Champion from the West outside of the Lakers or a Texas team since 1919!Really, since Utah went to back-to-back Finals, it's been Dallas 2x, OKC/GSW, and Spurs/Lakers.

They have more inherent value and have no associated red flags like they used to.

4411,"&gt;  Its wildly accepted not trading Klay was the move of the year.

It was **widely** (lol) accepted that the earth was flat at one point too. I don't understand the point of this sentence. 

&gt;First off Golden State is a defensive team that happens to be good at shooting.

That's not really accurate. They are 5th in defensive efficiency, and 1st in offensive efficiency by a wide margin. 

&gt;You want to swap their second best perimeter defender for one of the worst post defenders in the league? 

Why do people think Klay is some kind of defensive stud? He has -2.4 DBPM, -1.18 DRPM, he has the worst individual DRTG on the team, he is a poor rebounder and he doesn't get steals. I understand that the stats aren't perfect, and for the most part they ignore his decent on-ball defense. 

But his on-ball defense is not elite by any means. He is good at using his length to stay in front of his man, but when he gets beat he doesn't have the quickness to recover and players can out muscle him. He is valuable to GS because he can take on a lot of different matchups, but he usually only does an adequate job. 

Obviously if they traded him for Love, they would have gone after a 2 guard on a cheap deal. I am confident that they could have gotten someone with Klay's defensive chops. 

And Love's defense bad, but is partially made up for by his elite rebounding. That would help allow GSW to play the Death Lineup more often, as rebounding is the biggest problem for them. 

&gt;I dont care what Kevin Love can do offensively, put him on the dubs he'll have Harrison Barnes' job in the corner 

Incorrect, both in terms of Love's would-be role and Barnes' current role. When teams have been guarding Dray with wings, as described, the team has used SC/HB and DG/HB pick and rolls in bunches. That is where Love's value would be. 

&gt;That is absolutely critical in the Dubs' defense - they switch non-stop. Without Barnes / Iggy at 4, the dubs cant go small with Dray at 5. Put Love in there you're toast after one PnR switch.

Love is a better perimeter defender than you are giving him credit for. Teams would target him, sure, and he would hurt the defense a bit, but it wouldn't be a bloodbath. He is probably better off in a switching defense. 

&gt;um absolutely false. Our game plan was literally switch everytime and deny the 3 at all cost. Diaw, LMA etc...everyone switched on to Curry.

Why would you say false and then agree with me?

Yeah, anyone in the NBA theoretically could to be honest.

Is he likely to? No. Kobe shot 61% from the field on 46 FG attempts. Also, most of Kobe's points and shots came in the second half (55 points in 2nd half) since they were down 14 in that game heading into the third quarter.

4459,"in the 1980s with Bird, McHale, and Parish?",3,"Since Lebron and Chris Bosh's move to south beach, much of the league as been centered on the idea of creating a ""Big Three."" This spans from the existing (Tim, Manu, and Tony in San Antonio), the could have been (Durant, Westbrook, Harden), and now up and coming teams are searching for their own big three. Teams like Milwaukee, Minnesota, LA Lakers, and others either have their big three, or are searching for the third piece to complement their current young players.This will focus primarily on the Miami Heat and OKC Thunder, simply because I find the comparison between the two teams from a team-building approach to be fascinating.As we know, after the 2012 season the Thunder decided to part with Harden, breaking up what could have been one of the most intriguing collection of scorers ever assembled, but that brings the question of how well they would have fit together. Harden was not given the same opportunities in to be the player we know him to be as we now know him as in Houston. A quick look at the Thunder's player advanced stats from the last year they were together in the regular season and playoffs shows harden was not getting the same usage as he currently is in Houston, where he has averaged more than 28% in both the regular season and playoffs.Now let's take a look at what would most likely be considered the best season from the Big 3 era Heat, 2012-13.Regular Season Playoffs Most notably is the drop in usage by 4% by Chris Bosh in the playoffs. This put him at a usage rate significantly lower than that of James Harden in his last OKC year, who was averaging only 16-17 points per game instead of the near 30 we now know him for.Chris Bosh took the sacrifice of decreasing his usage for the sake of increasing the performance of the team. A quick look at Bosh's Career advanced stats shows a significant dip in Usage, PER, and some of the offensive measuring sticks such as OBPM and OWS. Also notice that in the first year after Lebron left his usage spiked up to the highest level it had been since his last year in Toronto.This brings the question of what the third component of a successful big three needs to bring. Chris Bosh re-formed his game from a post-up centered big, to eventually be a spot up shooter who did most of his work attacking the passing lanes on the defensive end. We see how much Kevin Love is struggling to re-tool his skill set around Lebron in Cleveland, while we see players like Draymond Green, whose best attributes might be defense and play-making, thrive next to two high usage scorers.Now that we have seen a glimpse of how Chris Bosh was used during the Heat's best season, let's look at the player OKC did keep, Serge Ibaka. Serge Ibaka would likely be classified as an athletic weak side shot-blocker with above average spot-up shooting who can play both the 4 and 5. It sounds pretty similar to what Chris Bosh ended up being for Miami, and the advanced stats are closer than you might think.These stats are taken from that same Miami Heat season, and the 2013-14 Thunder, when the Thunder made it to the Western Finals.This was also the last time Serge Ibaka was able to play in the playoffs either due to his own injury, or the injury to Durant keeping them out of the playoffs.Regular SeasonPlayoffsChris Bosh would likely be universally considered the better player, but Serge makes it look close here. Most importantly, it is good to keep in mind that Serge Ibaka was injured, and wasn't even supposed to play after injuring his calf in game 6 against the Clippers. He only missed two games and played despite everyone expecting him to not play the rest of the playoffs. Seriously, these headlines look about as grim as it gets.The question remains of would a lineup of KD/Westbrook/Durant be able to become the best team in the nba, and we will never know. More interesting might be if three high usage offensive superstars can work together, or are teams better off choosing the defensive minded big, who might not be as talented, as the third piece.For those interested, here are the career advanced stats up to their last championship in 2014 for the longest tenured trio in NBA History.Regular Season Playoffs The correct answer might just be finding one of the greatest players of all time in Tim Duncan, so you don't have to make that decision.",http://reddit.com/r/nba/comments/4a5wmh/c/d0xmfs8,1457824399,nba,"Team-Building and ""Big 3s"" (X-Post /r/nbadiscussion)",0,4a5wmh,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/4a5wmh,1457740800

4469,The Suns beat the Grizzlies. The Grizzlies beat the Cavs. Therefore Suns &gt; Cavs,2,"StatsThe Memphis Grizzlies won their game tonight 106-103, and that's utterly ridiculous because they had 8 players. Let's examine tonight's lineup:Lance Stephenson - Mostly known for blowing in Lebron's ear in the 2013-14 playoffs when he was still with the Pacers. He's been more entertaining than anything else due to his behavior and plays like this one.Tony Allen - ""First-Team All-Defense!"" Kobe called him the ""best defensive player I ever faced"" but he didn't mention his atrocious offense. A big reason the Warriors beat the Grizzlies last year was because Kerr basically decided to put two guys on Marc Gasol and ignore Tony. Allen shot all he wanted and made no impact. Which is why he should never lead the team in scoring.Vince Carter - Former ""half-man half-amazing"" and heart of Canada basketball, the last time he was relevant was the 2000 Olympics with the greatest dunk ever.Mario Chalmers - Only in Memphis to help Miami get under their luxury tax. Won a couple championships with Lebron but averaging less than ten points per game this year.Ryan Hollins - 50th overall pick in the 2006 NBA draft and has drifted around since then. The Grizzlies signed him to two ten-day contracts earlier this year before signing him after Marc Gasol was injured (more on that later).Jarell Martin, P.J. Hairston, JaMychal Green - Rookies and near-rookies who have spent more time in the D-League than anywhere else. Joerger hates playing young players like God hates sin.Who was injured: Marc Gasol (2014 All-Star, out for season), Mike Conley (starting point guard, shoulder), Zach Randolph (starting point forward, knee), Chris ""Birdman"" Andersen (shoulder), Matt Barnes (hamstring), Brandan Wright (knee), Jordan Adams (knee)Who did the Cavs have? Kyrie Irving, Kevin Love, J.R. Smith, only one injured player, and of course LeBron.24 turnovers certainly didn't help Cleveland, but how did they lose to Memphis? The Griz lost to the Suns at home last night 109-100. As a firm Grizzly fan, I fully expected to lose badly tonight. I never would have expected to lead until late in the fourth.Can anyone help me understand?TL;DR - ""Only in the movies and in Memphis"" - Don Poier",http://reddit.com/r/nba/comments/49ga4r/c/d0rpots,1457412535,nba,Memphis Grizzlies beat the Cavs in Cleveland - utterly bizarre game!,91,49ga4r,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/49ga4r,1457395200

Eventually, with under 2 minutes left there was a timeout and the call was changed.My question is: what happens if a 3pt/2pt is called incorrectly in, say, the last few minutes of a game and the team on the wrong end of the call has no timeouts and play continues interrupted to the end of the game?

4550,No thanks,6,"The play can be seen in full here.  The play starts with Durant clearing out from one corner to the next so the floor is properly spaced in their ""Horns"" formation.    Next, Ibaka steps up to Westbrook and sets a screen and proceeds to fade to the middle of the floor. Westbrook is met by Green ""hedging"" on the pick and roll while Paul recovers, causing (for a brief moment) two players to be on one, obviously leaving someone open.  To compensate for this, Jordan has to direct some of his attention to wherever Ibaka spaces out to, while also tracking his assignment rolling to the rim, Steven Adams.
Because of the divided attention, Redick is also partially responsible for ""tagging"" or ""bumping"" Adams on the roll if necessary. Similarly to Jordan, he also has to keep track of his original assignment in Andre Roberson, but because of his reputation as a poor long-range shooter, Redick assumes his divided attention will not be an issue.  So far, most of the off-ball defensive focus is guided towards whatever decision Westbrook makes, the most worrisome to the Clippers being an open Ibaka jumper. Their weak-side off-ball defenders are all prepared to move in response to this.  Knowing this, Roberson identifies the very moment which Jordan steps up a bit too much towards Ibaka (and to an extent, anticipating a rotation to cover for Paul getting beat by Westbrook off the dribble), causing Redick to step up to Adams. Because of this, Redick is no longer tracking him and Roberson cuts to the rim for an easy lob.  A couple times every game, OKC likes to send reminders to the opposition that Roberson still has to be treated as an off-ball threat, even though he is a poor three point shooter. In the grand scheme of things, maybe a backdoor lob doesn't change the game in itself, but the Thunder sure as hell hope it makes the defense worry about entirely loading up on the strong side ball-handler in pick and rolls.",http://reddit.com/r/nba/comments/4a078v/c/d0whqke,1457733949,nba,[OC] How OKC was able to make Roberson an effective off-ball Pick & Roll player for 1 play,149,4a078v,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/4a078v,1457654400

4586,"Hard screens and elbows, become the 1990's Detroit Pistons ",2,"First of all go read Gilbert Arenas Instagram post about how he would try to stop this dude if he were coaching against them. Kind of why I'm making this post to begin with because I'd really like to know some of everyone's ideas. Some things to think about: Which team would you use? How would you defend the Draymond/Curry p&r?First of all this team is so well put together you can't really stop them. Yea the Lakers blew them out Sunday but that was a combination of very poor shooting on the Warriors part (which is rare) and very good play, offense and defense, on the Lakers part. So props to LA.Moving forward, here's my game plan: let's say I step into Master Greg Pop-daddy's shoes and it's the WCF game 1 and I've got my healthy Spurs team of mostly 30-something year olds. My #1 priority is to get into Steph's head and break his confidence because at this point this dude feels invincible and is pulling up from anywhere and everywhere without hesitation. If I could just get him to take a split second on some of this shots then maybe that will cause his shooting % to take a dip. I will make sure my players know to get physical with him early and take a page out of CP3's book. At all times to start the game I want Kawhi to be right next to him breathing down his neck. And when they run him thru off-ball screens, I'm making sure the screeners man is at least giving him a bump. This same concept should be applied to everyone else on the court who's man is playing off the ball; don't let your man run in a straight line. Set a physical tone and make your man fight around you when he's off the ball and cutting towards the basket. As for Tony I stick him on Barnes for now and just pray he can hold his own for a bit lol. As for the Steph/Draymond p&r's there's a couple things I would do. Since it's game 1 and I'm in Oracle, I want my guys to stay home to every single 3 point threat. The last thing I want is for this entire team to start scoring because they will feed off the crowds energy. I'm going to live with having Steph and Draymond 's man defend their p&r's via a combination of Kawhi fighting over every single screen and hoping his length bothers him, or i'm playing ICE against the p&r and giving up Curry drives and Draymond open looks. Either way, I'm not switching anything and my other 3 players are staying home to their man with very limited help & recover defense. 
Eventually I will take Kawhi off of Steph and probably have Danny guard him and adjust accordingly. Honestly we can't hide Tony anywhere so I might have to stagger his minutes and have him play more against the bench. This is a headache.Now fast forward to game 3 and we're at home. My approach is much different; I'm starting out with Tony guarding Steph and i'm trapping the p&r every time and forcing the ball out of his hands. Now this team thrives off of chaos and Draymond is a master at 3v2 but whatever. I'm forcing other players to beat me and I'm daring Draymond to shoot or finish at the basket. Throughout much of the first half I'm forcing the ball out of Steph's hands and I'm living with Tony guarding Steph iso's.As for on offense it's simple: slow the game down and get LaMarcus going early. I'm running my offense thru Tony/LaMarcus pick and rolls and I'm doing all I can to get that dude going. At 6'7"" Draymond is undersized against a 6'11"" LaMarcus so I'm doing what I can to punish Draymond. I'm grinding the hell out of this team with our bigs and I'm using all 24 seconds of the shot clock to run our offense and create open looks.

4607,"The names are weird.

Center should be point guard since they are the center of the offense.

Forward should be the same as it is right now.

Guard should be centers, since they guard the rim and protect the paint.",2,"So i ve been an avid NBA fan since the mid 90s and I ve never heard an in-depth discussion and analysis of the names of the 5 positions on a team in basketball.
Here s a excerpt from wikipedia:There are many techniques for ball handling—shooting, passing, dribbling, and rebounding. Basketball teams generally have player positions, the tallest and strongest members of a team are called a center or power forward, while slightly shorter and more agile players are called small forward, and the shortest players or those who possess the best ball handling skills are called a point guard or shooting guard. The point guard directs the on court action of the team, implementing the coach's game plan, and managing the execution of offensive and defensive plays (player positioning).If you try to apply this naming scheme to any current basketball team you ll see that there are players who resist being put under these labels. I ll do it for the OKC because I think they have 2 great players that resist this naming-scheme. The current starting lineup for OKC isI ll admit that I m not OKC fan and don't know their rotations but from having watched them recently, I have these questions: is westbrook a point guard or shooting guard? is durant a power forward or a small forward? does it even matter. Ibaka and Kanter seem like the traditional centers: big slow guys that are to take up space and rebound/putback/block. waiters definitely seems like a primary ballhandler. This naming scheme does NOT work at all for the Warriors where everyone is supposed be an effective ballhandler. So if there any basketball coaches here, do these names really mean anything?

I want to get to it with the Heat. I want to be able to sign my deal and move on and not have to deal with any rumors, any free agency, any this, any that. This is where I want to end my career.

I mean you have 4 of the greatest players to ever play the game in that conference right now Durant, Dirk, Duncan, Chris Paul, and most likely Steph Curry. Then you have James Harden, Klay Thompson, Marc Gasol, Dwight Howard, and Russell Westbrook. Nobody wants to go to a Western Conference team (No offense but the teams are too strong) and if they go it's not for a Championship. Especially, if Durant joins up with GSW or SAS. Now I am not saying Durant is doing it for the money but more or less to make the best team in NBA history. Hopefully, he stays in OKC. If anything I for see Western Conference players coming to the Eastern Conference to take an easier path to the Finals.As a Heat fan I hope we don't trade our future away for 1-2 years of maybe beating a team in the Finals. When our future is looking so bright already. IMO a team of BRON, WADE, CP3, & MELO would have been great 3-5 years ago, but today can't compete with the likes of GSW + Durant or Spurs + Durant. Maybe even without a Durant because they have depth. Just food for thought. Oh, and Melo's comment on coming together later in their careers, yeh to lose? This is the end of Wade's career he only has a few years left. Melo you too. Every NBA player wants to win or make money. Not just lose and play with friends.

4613,I think that's the general assumption and to some degree it's probably true. The big thing to me is these guys do work as much as the average guy but for some reason their percentages are 20% lower. It's too large of a difference for that to be the sole reason.,1,"This was an idea brought up by Tom Heinsohn as seen in this video on Wilt Chamberlain.In the video Heinsohn theorizes, ""The problem with the big people is the small people are teaching them how to shoot a free throw so the big people have too much motion in the shot... they cannot soften the shot up enough because they're too strong.""You look at the poorest free throw shooters throughout league history and it's not simply the big guys but the very strongest who seem to have the most trouble with it. There isn't anything to suggest that these players are lazier or less coordinated than their counterparts. At least not to the degree that their free throw percentages are so much lower than everyone else's.I thought he made a great point about learning free throws from the small guys. While there may be a generally correct way or set of ways to shoot free throws it's entirely possible that's only true for most of the population. In any generalization it's easy to falsely dismiss an exception with some other explanation.What do you guys think? Could the free throw mechanics being taught be exacerbating the problem?",http://reddit.com/r/nba/comments/4bq3iq/c/d1bj7ki,1458805947,nba,Are some players too strong to shoot free throws?,0,4bq3iq,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/4bq3iq,1458777600

4806,No. This is ridiculous.,12,"Occasionally I try to watch basketball, but constant foul stoppages continuously deflate any moment of action from developing into more than 90 seconds of tempo throughout the game. Then in the final 1-2 minutes, the trailing team (no matter how impossible their chance of comeback) inevitably deploys the strategy of intentional fouls -- essentially devolving the ""sport"" into an individual technical skill competition. It's akin to if the final minutes of a football game transformed into a successive extra point exhibition between kickers.For fans emotionally invested in a specific team, there may be some prolonged tension gained from stretching a nearly impossible final minute comeback, for an extra 15 minutes of free throws and commercial breaks. But for the impartial viewer who just wants to watch a compelling athletic competition, it dilutes any semblance of entertainment.Here's my simple solution: make all fouls (except offensive) worth 1 extra shot more than they currently are. Shooting fouls: 2-pointer = 3 shots, 3-pointer = 4 shots. Non-shooting fouls are a little more tricky: Offensive foul = turnover, Defensive foul = 1 shot plus the ball.The stronger penalty for fouls would eliminate almost any possible advantage to do it intentionally in end game strategy, as well as throughout the game when a defender gets beat near the rim or on a breakaway. The added benefit, is that referees could then also stop calling ticky-tack, minor mutual contact fouls to maintain offense/defense balance. LESS MARGINAL FOULS BEING CALLED = LESS INCENTIVE TO FLOP.Organized basketball would become a bit more like a pick up game: more continuous back and forth action with less fouls/ft's/stoppages. And as an awesome bonus: referee's become less of a factor on the outcome of games!(Optional: if you're concerned that closing the ""intentional foul comeback strategy"" loophole will eliminate late game miracle comebacks, then add a 4 point line.)",http://reddit.com/r/nba/comments/4beuj4/c/d18h8im,1458602412,nba,Constant fouls/ft's make watching basketball boring -- here's a simple solution,0,4beuj4,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/4beuj4,1458518400

To prove this, I'll bring up two cases.
Number 1: Bill Walton.
Bill Walton, a great player (When he wasn't hurt)
Bill Walton only scored 6,215 Points (Though he did win two NBA championships and 1 MVP) While Derrick Rose has scored 7,925 Points Already (and he is under 30). Derrick Rose, forgoing another horrible injury, has a chance to win at least 1 championship, and might eventually reach around 13,000 to 15,000 career points. This, going along with his MVP, makes him an eventual player of the HoF.
A much stronger reason to put him in the HoF Ralph Sampson, a player who never won an NBA Championship or MVP, and was only a four time all star, and yet he is in the Hall Of Fame. If he can make it in with a much weaker career than what I think Derrick Rose already has I do think that this gives Derrick Rose a very high chance of getting in the Hall of Fame.

As a man in my early thirties still clinging to what's left on top, my heart swells with pride when I look back to see some of the greats rocking dad cuts. We're talking Drexler, World B. Free & Nate Thurmond just to name a few. The older I get, the more I realize that I am slowly watching children play - the gulf between us becoming wider and wider with each passing year. Just once, I would like to see some of our elders in the game tip their hats to the cruel gears of time, and rock some awful remnants of what they use to have in the hair department for just one season. Granted, we live in a different age, and none of those styles would fly with this new era of stars entering their 30s, but I think it would be hilarious and awesome to see a bunch of George Costanza-looking dads out there just balling every night.

4880,He'll be making 25 per in 2 years ,5,"Edit 4-11: I half assed this list a while back thought about it some more spent more time on it and basically revamped the whole thing. First so we get it out of the way. Here are the key free agents for upcoming years 2016: Note Im assuming LBJ either doesnt opt out or is just automatically resigning or doing his 1+1 bullshit
Durant, Al Horford, Mike Conley, DeMar DeRozan(im assuming he opts out), Hassan Whiteside, Nic BatumRFAs(most of the time this didnt have much impact): Andre Drummond, Harrison Barnes, Bradley Beal, Jordan Clarkson, Harrison Barnes 2017: 
Stephen Curry, Russell Westbrook, Blake Griffin(Im assuming he opts out), Chris Paul(same), Serge Ibaka, Kyle Lowry(same as other two), Paul Millsap(same), Gordon Hayward(same), Danilo Gallinari(same), JJ Redick, Jrue Holiday, Greg Monroe(same) RFA: Giannis Antetokounmpo, Rudy Gobert, Victor Oladipo, Nikola Mirotic, Nerlens Noel, Steven Adams 2018: 
UFA: Avery Bradley, Isaiah Thomas, DeMarcus Cousins, James Harden, Derrick Favors(not an exhaustive list)Here's the list. 1) Karl Anthony Towns: Idk, I could write a whole big thing about it, but this just feels right 2) Stephen Curry: He's 28. He's also gonna be making $25 mil more per yr than KAT starting next summer.  Odds are pretty low he'll ever have a season like this again. Best bet is we see a mix of 2013, 2014 and then also 2015 Curry the next few years before he starts declining. Add it all up, KAT is the guy IMHO. Still, this could easily end up being wrong not putting him at the top. 3) Anthony Davis: He misses at least 15 games a year, he really declined on D this year and I dont think long term he can play Center. Still, Id rather have him for the long haul than Kawhi. 4) Kawhi Leonard: He's not gonna keep up the 45% shooting from 3 and I just dont think it's sustainable past a point to keep up this perennial DPOY year stuff. Even if he goes from this to top 3-5 defensive player in the league in coming years, it affects his value. Counter to that is he keeps adding more and more to his offense. 5) LeBron James 6) Kevin Durant: No idea what the hell to do with him. I looked at it like this: If I were OKC and there were no trade deadline and somebody called me with an offer for Durant the five guys above are still the only ones Id consider moving him for even with the upcoming free agency. 7) Paul George 8) Russell Westbrook: He's a UFA next year but by and large same logic with KD. I still wouldnt trade him for anybody below this list.9) Giannis Antetokounmpo 10) DeMarcus Cousins 11) Jimmy Butler: Contract pushed above of Harden. 12) James Harden: All the stuff, the D and the complete lack of effort, him not getting along with people and him just not being a guy to provide leadership and be the one who people respond to well, it all adds up as to reasons behind what happened in Houston this year. 13) John Wall: 14) Damian Lillard: 15) Draymond Green: For as much as you could argue ""Would he be as good on a different team"" etc alot of this comes down to his contract as to why he got bumped up16) Kristaps Porzingis: This is probably 5 spots too high and really highlights how all the upcoming free agency affects things.  17) Andre Drummond: 18) Rudy Gobert19) Andrew Wiggins: He's not really doing things to help teams win( not efficient, defense isnt what you were hoping itd be) but still hard not to see him at least bordering on all-star caliber down the road. 20) Blake Griffin: You could talk me into this being too low or ten spots too high. Total wildcard. Just cant get out of my head what he did to the Spurs last year. 21) Derrick Favors 22) CJ McCollum: Next 5 spots or so were by far the hardest out of any. 23) LaMarcus Aldridge: I think he'll age well24) Jae Crowder: That contract thou...Im not as big a Crowder guy as some(I think there' a decent chance he regresses some next year) but this was the guy who benefited more from his contract than anybody else 25) Kevin Love: The real Love is somewhere between that Minnesota guy who put up absurd stats that even smart people were calling him a borderline top 5 player and this albatross who's in the worst situation imaginable. 26) Chris Paul: There's a pretty strong historical precedent that people this size fall off around this age. Combine that with him being a UFA next summer and this is what you get. 27) Aaron Gordon: Im all in 28) Eric Bledsoe 29) DeAndre Jordan: Last two years of the contract probably arent going to be great value but DAJ has finally been as good people said he was in the past this year on defense.30) Nikola Jokic 31) Kyrie Irving: Voulgaris summed it up perfectly ""He's the new Rudy Gay"". It's less and less clear he actually significantly helps teams in terms of winning basketball. Hasnt looked the same at all this yr post injury32) Khris Middleton33) Klay Thompson: He in particular on GS is the guy who wouldnt look anywhere close to as good on a number of other teams. 34) Gordon Hayward: Huge fan but this is what being a FA next summer will do and cause you to slide. 35) Jabari Parker: He's really started coming on past few months, this might be too low 36) Kyle Lowry: He's a legit All NBA guy this year but that's not what this list is about. He'll never have a year as good as this again, he's 30, he's not the type wholl age well and he's gonna be a FA next summer. 37) Myles Turner 38) D'Angelo Russell: Lol 39) Carmelo Anthony: The declines gonna keep coming i dont think people realize how different he is now than he was 2 years ago even. 40) Justice Winslow: The comparisons he gets are a little ridiculous but he's pretty much a lock to be a top notch defender. That and if he can project to being an average-slightly below average offensive player is plenty to keep him here. 41) Jonas Valanciunas: Shout out for finally improving the D. 42) Emmanuel Mudiay: Huge fan coming out, he's done enough lately to restore faith after having one of thee worst offensive seasons in NBA history first few months 43) Isaiah Thomas 44) Tobias Harris: If he keeps playing like he has since being with SVG he's gonna keep rising. 45) Devin Booker: I hate how bad he looks defensively but cant drop him any lower. 46) Ricky Rubio: He should make All-Defense this year. 47) Avery Bradley: 48) Victor Oladipo49) Jahlil Okafor: I guess he's gotta be on here but there's nothing enticing about a traditional big who's looking this bad on defense.50) Clint Capela: Im probably a little too high on him but fuck it Just Missed Category in Order: Paul Millsap Trey Lyles Nikola Vucevic Brook Lopez Danilo Gallinari Serge Ibaka Reggie Jackson Bradley Beal Cody Zeller ",http://reddit.com/r/nba/comments/4bsrya/c/d1c2qti,1458843998,nba,Trade Value Rankings for 2016,0,4bsrya,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/4bsrya,1458777600

4897,"He has stretches of supreme capability but most of the time, he's getting destroyed on defense and turning it over in clutch situations. I think he's more likely to be out of the league than he is being as valuable as Crowder is. ",5,"I tried posting this as a link yesterday, because I wasn't aware of r/nba's self promotion policies. After messaging the mods I hope this format works. I'm a big fan of the team building aspect of the NBA, so I'd like to see more content related to that on r/nba.I briefly mentioned in my last post that good teams have a tendency to find undervalued players from other teams’ rosters and turn them into reliable contributors. Great front offices find great value, while bad front offices overpay. Great coaching staffs get the most out of the talent on their rosters, while bad coaching staffs stifle a player’s development.In 2013 the Hawks gave Demarre Carroll a 2 year, $5 million dollar contract. He was a 26-year-old coming off a mediocre season in which he scored 6 ppg on .460/.286/.765. Hardly a scrub but far from a valuable contributor. Within two years Carroll was one of the premiere floor spacers and wing defenders, scoring 12.6 ppg on .487/.395/.702. His $2.5 million yearly salary was one of the best bargains in the NBA, and he was rewarded with a 4 year, $58 million salary the following offseason.When the Spurs signed Danny Green to a minimum contract in 2010, he was a bottom of the depth chart player He bounced between the Spurs and the D-league for a year and a half before becoming a solid contributor on the 2011-2012 Spurs, posting 9.1 ppg on .442./.436/.790. Now, four years later, he has been a key contributor on a championship team and is known as one of the best 3 and D players in the league. His 4 year, $40 million dollar contract signed last offseason was widely viewed as a huge bargain when compared to his open market value.Jae Crowder was an afterthought in the trade that sent Rajon Rondo to Dallas. The Celtics were getting two 1st round picks, a $12.9 million trade exemption, and two established players in Brandan Wright and Jameer Nelson. Who cared about the 23-year-old, tweener forward who couldn’t shoot or handle the ball? Danny Ainge obviously did. That tweener forward is now scoring 14.4 ppg on .450/.348/.825. He looks to be a major part of the Celtics’ plans going forward, and his 5 year, $35 million contract will be one of the best deals in the league for years to come.Contending teams absolutely have to find undervalued players that contribute heavily in order to compete. The NBA CBA allows teams to pay a maximum contract of anywhere from 25-35% of the salary cap based on how long that player has been in the league. Most contending teams have two or three maximum salary players. That's anywhere from 50-99% of your salary cap gone right off the bat. No team can win with two stars and a handful of minimum contracts. In order to navigate through this a team either needs maximum salary level players who make significantly below the max (Stephen Curry, Tim Duncan) or find these diamond in the rough, who make much less than they're worth.A good example of how this concept works is Iman Shumpert. Last year Shumpert was a bargain for the Cavs on his rookie deal of $2.6 million, but last offseason the Cavs gave him a bloated 4 year, $40 million contract, which they've been trying to fruitlessly unload ever since. His contract will hinder their ability to make trades and free agent signings for years to come. They would have been better off letting Shumpert walk in free agency and finding another undervalued wing player to come in and take his minutes.Who will be the next batch of players to come out of seemingly nowhere to make a major impact in the league? I decided to play GM and make a list of some players that I think could find success if put in the right situation.G E’Twaun Moore - BullsE’Twaun Moore has played really well in the absence of Jimmy Butler this year, putting up 7.6 ppg on .485/.451./.629. He’s an adequate defender, who hustles hard, and, if he keeps his hot shooting up, could turn into a valuable floor spacer. He hits free agency this offseason, and I think he could get paid. Look for him to get a contract in the $6-8 million range, which could be a good deal if he continues shooting so well.G Shane Larkin - NetsShane Larkin is playing a lot for a bad Nets team and is quietly establishing himself as a solid player. He’s undersized (5’11”, 175) for today’s NBA, but he is smarter than your average point guard. He has a great feel in the pick and roll, and has a knack for making the smart pass. He is also improving his shooting, putting up 6.7 ppg on .434/.344/.794. He has a player option for next season worth $1.5 million. If he declines, I’d look for him to get a contract in the $4-6 million range, which could turn into a bargain if he continues his development.F Darrell Arthur - NuggetsIt seems like Darrell Arthur has been in the NBA forever. However he’s only 27-years-old. Over his career he’s completely changed what kind of player he is and what role he plays. In the last three years he has exponentially increased the amount of threes he’s taken, and he is making them more often. Three years ago he took 18 threes and made 5 (.278). So far this year he has taken 81 and made 32 (.395). Floor spacing 4’s are more valuable now than ever, so look for Arthur to decline his player option for next year and sign a larger contract. He seems to constantly fly under the radar, so maybe a team can get him for cheap.G/F Jakarr Sampson - NuggetsJakarr Sampson reminds me a lot of pre-Atlanta Demarre Carroll. He’s a tall wing who currently can’t shoot, but hustles hard and plays good D. Teams like Atlanta, San Antonio, Miami, and Dallas seem to improve players’ shots easily, so if Sampson gets picked up by one of them, I’d expect him to improve quickly and become a valuable contributor. If I’m a GM who’s confident my coaching staff could improve his shooting, I’d give up a future 2nd rounder for him or wait for him to hit free agency and give him a small, “prove it” contract.G/F Quincy Pondexter - PelicansQuincy Pondexter has been a solid contributor on some good teams, but I think his ceiling is higher than that. I thought this year would be his coming out party as a solid starter, but Pondexter is out for the 2015-2016 season because of knee surgery. If he can come back full strength, I think his 3 year, $11 million dollar contract will be an absolute steal going forward. He can defend 2-4’s, and his career three point percentage is .365. His open market value (assuming he comes back full strength) would be huge because of the role he fills, which is similar to Carroll and Crowder.F Andrew Nicholson - MagicAndrew Nicholson has never gotten enough playing time. His per 36 numbers show a player who could score 14.1 ppg on .436/.333/.788, yet he is stuck playing 13.8 mpg. He’s a guy who can play in the post, stretch the floor, and rebound. This is the last year of his rookie contract, and he will be a restricted free agent at season’s end. He’d be a bargain at $5-8 million, and I doubt the magic would match.Hollis Thompson - 76ersOf everyone on this list, Hollis Thompson is my favorite. He’d be my top pick to follow the Carroll, Green, Crowder path and turn into a solid contributor for a good team. He puts up 9.1 ppg on .401/.383/.689. He’s not a great defender, but he can adequately guard 2-4’s and would probably be better on a team with another solid wing defender to take pressure off. He has a team option for the 2016-2017 season, which I’m sure the 76ers will pick up. If I was a GM, Thompson would be a top player I’d try to snag away from the 76ers as an afterthought in a bigger trade.F Quincy Acy - KingsMost NBA fans know Quincy Acy for his periodic highlight dunks, but there is more to him than that. Acy is developing a respectable jump shot, having hit 26 of his 79 three point attempts over the last two years (.329). He doesn’t get a lot of blocks, but he held opponents to just .452 shooting at the rim last year. Tim Duncan held opponents to .470, and DeAndre Jordan to .485. If he were to hit his ceiling, Acy could be an excellent 3 and D forward. Unfortunately Acy hasn’t displayed the highest basketball IQ over his career, but there’s hope a great coach, like Rick Carlisle, could fully utilize his unique skillset. Acy will hit free agency during the 2017 offseason. I think he will be available for the veteran minimum, so some lucky team could get a huge steal if they make good use of his talent.Here's a link to my blog, where I originally posted this article.https://robsorensensports.wordpress.com/2016/03/14/diamonds-in-the-rough-finding-the-nbas-next-jae-crowder/",http://reddit.com/r/nba/comments/4ak57q/c/d113dg0,1458075509,nba,Diamonds in the Rough: Finding the NBA's next Jae Crowder (OC),31,4ak57q,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/4ak57q,1458000000

4920,Stotts is a heckuva coach. Doesn't get enough credit around here.,4,"Aldridge is having the most efficient season of his career, putting up 18 ppg on 57% TS. In his previous three seasons with Portland, he scored 22.5 ppg on 52% TS, which is below average and incredibly inefficient, especially for a guy his size. Before everyone says Aldridge has a better supporting cast this year, that might be true, but the Blazers had one of the best starting lineups in the league that complemented him perfectly (Lopez, Batum, Matthews, and Lillard), yet Aldridge was still very inefficient.This season, 32% of Aldridge's shot are catch and shoot. 45% of his shots are less than 10 feet away from the basket. Last season with the Blazers, 30% of his shots were catch and shoot and only 34% of his shots were less than 10 feet away.However, the major difference comes with the amount of fadeaway/turnaround  long 2's he has taken. This year, he has only take 96 fadeaway/turnaround jump shots. Last year, he took 209. The total number of 16-24 foot jumpers he took last year was 514. This year he's only at 283. (stats from [NBA Savant](nbasavant.com/))The Spurs have obviously realized that contested long 2's are an inefficient way to score and has made Aldridge take more shots in the paint, which makes sense since he's like 6'11 260+. He's playing more like an actual big man this season and taking much more efficient shots, even though he's already almost 31.If the Blazers realized this and put Aldridge into a better spot to succeed, he could've been a much better player. Instead, they wasted his prime years by allowing him to continue scoring very inefficiently, instead of utilizing his strengths.Does this show the incompetence of the Blazers coaching staff and not realize this? They built a perfect team around him when he was a Blazer, yet they never helped him adjust his game and play to his strengths. With guys like Lillard, Batum and Matthews to complement his skills in the post, the Blazers should've allowed Aldridge play to his strengths instead of allowing him to keep taking long contested jumpers.",http://reddit.com/r/nba/comments/4cg6tv/c/d1hxutu,1459273544,nba,[OC] Did the Blazers ruin LaMarcus Aldridge's career by not playing him correctly?,0,4cg6tv,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/4cg6tv,1459209600

4996,"My analysis is that Houston just got hot in the second half, hitting shots they weren't in the first half.  Even in the first half, when the Raptors raced to a double digit lead, the Rockets were able to claw back but would slip again until they finally controlled the game late in the game.

Corey Brewer hit 5 threes that game.  I'm not even sure he has hit 5 the whole season before this game.  He has been horrible this season but had a great game last game.  If he didn't catch fire, Rockets would have surely lost since no one besides Harden can create points for his team.  

Toronto also went away from the things that made them had the league in the first place.  They were outrunning us on fastbreak and were working the ball around on offense, two of the biggest defensive weakness of the Rockets.  But in the later stages of the game, they resorted into a quite a bit of isolation for DeMar. 

There is a saying that you should never let a struggling road team hang in the game because the more time they are within striking distance, the more likely the home team losses that game.  Well, Houston was the struggling road team that was able to hang around right until they could get home and stole the game.",5,"The Raptors finished the first half with a ten-point lead over the Rockets in what looked like a pretty ordinary game between a fringe playoff team and a conference final contender.The Rockets came into the second half and didn’t do anything drastically different schematically and as a result, allowed the Raptors to extend their lead fifteen points by the eight-minute mark.The monumental difference that occurred at that moment was the substitution that took Donatas Motiejunas out of the game in exchange for Corey Brewer, which slotted the 6’9, 186 pound swingman at the nominal Power Forward position. Corey Brewer would not check out of the game for the remaining 16 minutes and in that time he was a +20.This allowed the Rockets to do numerous things, both offensively and defensively.DefenseThe main deterrent when placing a wing at the nominal Power Forward spot is that it may leave the smaller defending team with a mismatch when it comes to post ups. Oddly enough, the Raptors have the perfectly weird combination of Valanciunas and Scola where that actually might be an issue.To combat the potential mismatch that would lead to Scola posting up any of the Houston wings, the Rockets chose to assign their most infamous defender in James Harden to defend Scola. Harden possesses some positive traits as a post defender, mainly that he has an incredibly strong base for a guard. Additionally, when the Rockets put Harden on Scola, they also decided they would double as soon as the ball entered the post, allowing for one of three speedy defenders to pressure Scola into tough decision making.https://streamable.com/e/vteeScola had to face very quick and long defenders as well as having only one legitimate three-point threat on the floor to pass to. Even if you can consider DeMar a threat to attack from the perimeter upon a close out, the remaining two non-shooters (Valanciunas and Johson) make that decision very hard for Scola and it showed.The Rockets’ aggressive defense didn’t end there. They leveraged their quickness and ability to rotate and recover by doubling the primary ball-handlers (Lowry and DeRozan) on high pick and rolls. The previously mentioned lack of shooting, as well as playmaking made those scenarios very difficult.https://streamable.com/e/65d5
Even when the Raptors were able to dump the ball off to the open 4-man, the Rockets were tremendous in their rotations, further proving that Houston can really be a great defensive team when they want to be.OffenseOne of the primary incentives of “going small” is that it allows the offensive team to have more shooters on the court, therefore opening up the possibility of a “Spread Pick and Roll”. As long as the 5-man sets a solid screen for the ball-handler, causing penetration into the middle of the floor, the remaining 3 defenders will be tasked with guarding 4 players, all of which are threats to score. The Rockets executed this to perfection.https://streamable.com/e/9i5fThe Rockets spiced things up offensively by not just resorting to high pick and rolls, rather, they used DHO’s (dribble hand-offs) to add variety to their offense. By doing so, they did not allow the Raptors to settle in and specifically target something schematically.Yes, the Raptors had some very notable mistakes which are concerning by themselves, but having no answer for 3 shooters surrounding a high pick and roll only exacerbated any of the actual issues and made them more impactful than they had to be. Additionally, the lack of speed from the front court positions also became glaringly clear because of the added three point threats.While the Raptors did not have a great opportunity to change their defensive scheme against the Harden/Howard pick and roll, they certainly could have to the Harden/Brewer combination that terrorized them. The Raptors chose to “hedge” on all pick and rolls as well as DHO’s involving that pairing, while deploying a lineup that consisted of either Luis Scola or Patrick Patterson at the 4-spot. Due to current personnel restraints, the Raptors chose to not match up with another wing against Brewer. This left a slower and less agile defender assigned to Brewer. This is some of the carnage that ensued as a result of the pick and roll defense.https://streamable.com/e/j5b8It could have been so much worse. Corey Brewer shot 5/10 from three point range and some of those misses were awful after great looks given by the Raptors’ schematic choices and Harden’s great passing.https://streamable.com/e/8dwcThis isn’t to say that Brewer wasn’t also hot, he most certainly was.
Some combination of quickness as well as having the hot hand led to him scoring some doozies of the bounce.https://streamable.com/e/1vspHowever, Corey Brewer being hot for the first 20 minutes should lead someone to believe that continuous open looks will only lead to disaster for the remaining 10, which it did.The Raptors could’ve done things differently. They could have doubled Harden on every high pick and roll and made him dish it to the rolling Brewer/Howard/Capela. They could’ve given some spot minutes to Norman Powell and played 4 guards and 1 big, allowing them to switch more pick and rolls. He had played well in Portland and in his brief first half stint, against Houston he continued his solid defensive outing, yet he was a no-show in the second half. They could have even put Patterson/Scola on any other of the Rockets’ wings (Terry, Ariza, Beverly) just so the Rockets would have had to feel uncomfortable with new screening partners every possession, and who knows, they might have even got lucky with one of the new screeners getting cold.
Instead, Toronto played Houston pretty much the same the entire second half even when there were obvious examples of their defensive scheme not working. If any team should know the difficulties of hedging on every pick and roll, it’s the Raptors! They overhauled their coaching staff for that very purpose as they moved towards ICEing this past summer.Some simple experimentation was all that was necessary. I doubt it could’ve gone worse than what actually happened in the second half.

5108,"Ah, TIL.",1,"I think we are all under the impression that DeRozan is a max player. That means he will be able to fetch 30% of the salary cap next year, or $26,700,000. I think he truly wants to stay in Toronto, but he will probably take a max contract if someone else offers it. This means the Raptors will probably have to max him to keep him. 
 Payroll Source, Cap Source
  Here is our 2016-2017 depth chart without any trades or acquisitions: There are some gaping holes. Maxing DeRozan will put the team payroll ~$11,000,000 above the cap, with only ~$8,000,000 left to play with in luxury tax.

Maybe we need to stop thinking of these as bad shots, and start practicing these until they are part of the game.",-3,"In 1940 playing for the University of Wyoming, Kenny Sailors became a sensation with his one handed, jumping into the air release, that is the prototypical jump shot that we are accustomed to today. Sailors came up with the jump shot when he was getting his shot constantly blocked by his older, much taller brother. To get a shot off over his brother, he jumped in the air to release the ball. This has become the norm for NBA players throughout the NBA's history. As a on the ground set shot release would be easily blocked by the league's best athletics in the world.In the now legendary regular season game between Golden State and OKC, Curry was able to get his shot over much taller defenders, a lot of the time the 7 foot Steven Adams, one of the best defender in the league. Two shots stood out in particular (minus the 38"" game winning 3):Pump fake then shot over AdamsFake dribble pass then 3Curry has somehow made the set shot work EVEN BETTER than the jump shot. The advantage of the jump shot is the player is rising in the air as they raise the ball, square up, and line up the shot. To do so on the ground would give the defender ample time to recover and block the shot. But Curry's set shot requires almost zero time to square up before release. How is he doing this? The next generation of players are almost guaranteed to emulate this shot, as it is better than the current ""text book"" model.

This obviously falls more under the category of ""food for thought"" than ""likely future change.""Right now in the NBA, despite a ton of talent in the league, there are really only ~6 teams competing for the championship (sorry celtics.)  I personally would prefer a system where most playoff teams at least have a chance.An idea to increase parity: A free agent auction.Similar to a draft, instate a free agent auction or bidding process.  This would stop players from taking less money to collude with one another and would stop players from being drawn to big markets at discounts for endorsement reasons.  There are a lot of kinks like extensions or how to schedule when all the auctions would happen that would need to be worked out but here is the concept:1) A players contract expires.
2) Player declares how long of a deal they would like.  Say 3 year deal.
3) All teams can offer a flat rate contract for those years.  Say 10 million a year.
4)  The players previous team can match any offer.
5)  If that team has bird rights then 15% of the contract will not count against the cap.  Teams can go over the cap to resign, but luxury tax rules apply.
6) No maximum offer.I personally think players ""teaming up"" hurts the game.  And I think having a player like Harrison Barnes (fourth best on his team) getting talked about for a maximum contract is a clear indicator that the max should not exist or be much, much higher.  Having a free market for players would avoid super teams and would still encourage keeping teams together by being able to match for a discount to the cap hit.",http://reddit.com/r/nba/comments/49jms7/c/d0s9sqp,1457459742,nba,The Road to Parity: a Free Agent Auction,0,49jms7,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/49jms7,1457395200

5185,"Last year we jumped from 25 wins to 38 wins, and the major difference was that we switched coaches from TY Corbin to Quin Snyder.

Any comments, examples, links to previous analysis etc post away. Also, how exactly did you get to whatever number you got to is worth thinking about. We can make this discussion either the impact of a good coach vs a replacement level coach or a good coach vs an awful coach. Whichever one you want to post about. My estimation: The best coaches are probably worth say 7 wins a year above replacement. In some instances, like Pop in San Antonio, maybe you could push that closer to 9-10 but those are very specific instances. IF you put some god awful coach in San Antonio, my best guess is they go from 70 wins to say 54 and go from a real threat to the Warriors to being a step behind OKC and barely above the Clippers in the playoffs. Perhaps the most youll ever see a coach influence a team is Mark JAckson vs Steve Kerr but a big part of that was also luck to some extent as Kerr will be the first person to tell you he never intended on starting Draymond Green initially. I do think bad coaches might be more detrimental. This is especially true for a very bad coach on what's a talented roster.

5383,"Beasley was an insanely hyped Freshman in college who delivered.  He averaged like 25/12 his Freshman year.  He was a first team all American and was in the running for player of the year as a Freshman.

Some thought he would be picked number 1 in the NBA draft, but Chicago took Derrick Rose instead.  Rose was from Chicago, which a lot of people think influenced this decision, although he obviously ended up having a far better career than Beasley.

How much hype did Beasley have?  He got picked before OJ Mayo, Kevin Love, Brook Lopez, and many other solid NBA players.

He was by no means a bad NBA player to start out, but he had attitude problems and just never fit in anywhere.  A 2 pick averaging 14 a game on 47/40/77 splits as a rookie isn't amazing, but it isn't bad either.  These numbers were overshadowed by him being lazy, a jerk, etc.

In his third year, he got traded to MN, mainly because everyone in Miami didn't like him.  He dropped a respectable 19 a game, although on worse shooting numbers.  Then he got hurt in year 4, came back, and wasn't the same. 

He ended up back in Miami and had a couple rough years in which he was also a ""locker room cancer"" before going to China to dominate for 2 seasons.

Hopefully he's grown up a little and can be a solid contributor in the NBA, but we'll see...

5387,This has me even more salivating at teams being forced to get away from the red/white/blue.,-2,"2 days ago, NBA commissioner Adam Silver appeared on ESPN's the Jump and described adding advertising to jerseys as ""Manifest Destiny"", the 19th century attitude toward expansion into the Western United States. It's an amazing (if not frightening) insight into how large corporations view profitable opportunities and no matter how slight he may try to make it seem, by using Silver's own logic, turning an NBA uniform into adspace will greatly impact how you and future generations view the sport.In the interview, Adam Silver makes two points about ads on jerseys...So to address 1., NBA owners are like most major business owners are interested in maximizing profit and Adam Silver is acknowledging that if the owners see another revenue stream, they are going to do it because their profit line is more important than anything else. The NBA is a business, their business.So, what's a little patch on your favorite teams jersey? Except how long will it be a small patch? If it works and owners come to the opinion that a larger patch would mean larger profits, then soon those ads are huge. You could say it's ""inevitable"". Anyone who has watched the premiere league recently knows how drastic jersey advertising can become.Putting ads on jerseys cheapens the NBA brand. Adam Silver is launching the first volley in a corporate sell off my favorite teams jersey and it won't end until my beloved Boston Celtics Uniform looks like trash. I cherish my team's identity and history and the uniform has been the constant that has tied the different generations together. I can't believe that the NBA is putting that identity up for sale and tying a fan's affection to another company's brand. What happens when one these giant corporations gets into a scandal or does something a team's fanbase doesn't agree with. I can ignore an ad on the side of a court but I can't ignore one on my favorite player. It's shoving more advertising at me during an age when I value every respite from being marketed to that I can find.TL:DR: I guess I just wished that the NBA owners respected the NBA brand as much as I did and left the jerseys alone.

5399,I thought this would include something about Currys defense considering the title........,2,"OPINION (edited)Stephen Curry is amazing to watch, that is without question. He marks off every item in the checklist of what you want to see from a point guard. Shoots the ball unbelievably? Check. 
Can dribble the ball through singular players as well as entire defenses seamlessly? Check.
Passes accurately and purposefully when necessary? Check.
Quick hands on defense for intercepting passes and pickpocketing players? Check.The list goes on and on, but for reading purposes, I'll stop there. Here's the ridiculous thing about Curry: he does all these things exceptionally well (which would make for a great starting point guard on any team), but he does so with exceptional consistency.Curry is so confident in himself that it seems as if he can perform any task while making the right decision every time. For example: lets say he gets down the court and notices that the defense isn't exactly equipped to deal with him. Well, while the defense tries to correct, BOOM. Curry has already jacked up a deep three and is heading back to the other end of the court to play defense because he knows it is going in. Or how about the defense is set up to play tight defense on the three? Well thats not a problem. He's already blown by you and going to the rack where he will either float one sky high and let it drop in the bucket without even touching the rim or pull up for an easy mid-range. For the sake of the hypothetical, lets say you manage to play defense on all three of Curry's shots (the three, mid-range, and close range). Well you definitely weren't able to do so with just one defender, you must have had help defense. The man who had to play help defense? Well, he left his man open. And Curry's already passed him the ball. Thats a bucket.So how do you stop Curry and his relentless pursuit of making defenses look foolish? Well . . . uh . . . yeah I don't know either.

Plus there are some pretty good series here:Golden State and Houston would meet each other in the first round in a matchup of last years Western Conference Finals.Cleveland, a team with Finals aspirations goes up against the 2nd best backcourt in the NBA headlined by Damian Lillard and CJ McCollum.Kevin Durant goes up against Paul George in a matchup between Oklahoma City and Indiana.One of the more media dominating teams in the league in the Clippers take on a currently red hot Charlotte team flying under the radar.There is a lot to like here compared to the potential first round matchups we have right now:WestEastWhat do you guys think?

",-1,"I just had a brainstorm of something that will never, ever happen. But tell me what you think. There is a one-and-done March Madness style tournament of the 5-6-7-8 teams in each conference. It is held immediately after the regular season ends at a predetermined city. So games are M-W-F.Reasons why I like this idea:1) It takes away the incentive to tank ala the Sixers or the Lakers or whoever. The best you can do is the two seed.2) It adds in an incentive to actually build a playoff quality team.3) The general rule-of-thumb is that the worst spot in the league is ""the middle."" Getting from the middle to elite status is very hard. Becoming a true title contender is incredibly hard without having a Top 10 (at least) player. This makes being in the upper-middle actually ideal. A team like Portland did very well. They drafted a stud in Dame. He has a great backcourt-mate in CJ. They have a lot of nice pieces. But getting from where they to becoming a legitimate title contenting team is a near impossible task. They (and Memphis and Utah and Charlotte and etc.) should be rewarded for having smart team building methods. They're a player short. Getting that one player makes such a huge difference, if they nail the pick.4) Teams that finish 1-2-3-4 have a week to rest. That creates an incentive to not try and jockey to get the five seed and sneak into this one-and-done tournament.5) It will help small markets.6) It will add to draft intrigue. Say Utah wins this thing. Do they go for a rookie long on potential (Simmons) versus someone arguably ready to play now (Buddy)? I think this idea would work.

5498,"Warriors are very switch heavy on the perimeter. I think the defensive perception of Klay is inflated due to the fact that sometimes he switches on the opposing PG and the narrative that has stuck for years (when curry actually was indeed a bad defender) that curry is being hid. But overall, he seems to mostly get cooked by every good SG, and in the instances that he does guard the opposing PG, he honestly does a pretty poor job then as well. But that's not really why I think klay is overrated. I just think he's poor because he gets beat on cuts/back doors and on pick and rolls way more than anyone else.

He may be a solid on-ball defender but people just don't realize how relatively little on-ball D impacts the game as a whole compared off-ball/help/rotations D, which I think may describe ""why"" his defensive metrics come out poor. It's been multiple years running that his DBPM, DRPM, and RAPM have all come out as negative despite him being apart of an elite defensive team, and realistically that can't just be by accident over such large samples.

For example he allows an EFG% of 50.9 on pick and rolls which is absolutely horrendously bad, and 10% worse than what Curry allows.

It's just normal for people's attention to be focused on wherever the ball is, but I think if people actually were to watch Klay off ball/in help situations and his P&amp;R awareness, they would see where his faults are.",1,,http://reddit.com/r/nba/comments/48imr7/c/d0k1g6c,1456876998,nba,"According to ESPN, Derrick Rose is 3rd from last (81st overall) in DRPM among PGs.",2,48imr7,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/48imr7,1456790400
5499,Report me,4,"I've argued on this sub that the Cavs should bring Kyrie off the bench but still give him starter-level minutes. My reasoning was that the Cavs are presently diluting the considerable talent of their three ball-dominant stars. Figuring out a way to stagger their minutes would enable the Cavs to maximize their stars' potential while always having one of the big three on the floor. Since Lebron and K-Love looked good together to start the season without Kyrie, I suggested it would make sense to experiment with bringing Kyrie off the bench, surrounding him with defensive specialists and spot up shooters, and giving him the green light to go nuts. At the time I argued that Delly could spend the first six minutes of every game tiring out the opposing point guard, after which the Cavs could bring Kyrie in to go ham on the opponents' bench. Since Kyrie is still young and since his past injuries are largely unrelated, I reasoned he would be able to handle the reduction in rest time that goes along with coming off the bench and playing big minutes. The reality of NBA egos and the status that goes with being a starter, however, makes this quite unlikely. Nevertheless, the Cavs have experimented with some success with a variation of my idea in which Kyrie starts but plays big minutes after the first quarter without Lebron and K-Love on the floor. This has allowed the Cavs to put an efficient offense on the floor while resting Lebron, which has been almost embarrassingly difficult for them to do this past year and a half. No team with this much talent should be so dependent on their best player, especially when that player is thirty-one years old and has played more basketball this past decade than maybe anyone else in the world. Even if this simple change paid off, however, the Cavs would not be even close to the Warriors' historic level of greatness. If they want to win the Finals rather than come up short for the second year in a row, the Cavs' coaching staff will have to countenance dramatic and risky changes in team strategy. It is an underappreciated fact about last years' Finals that David Blatt was out coached by Steve Kerr. People assume that Blatt's ability to push the series to six games by slowing the pace with a depleted lineup indicates good coaching, but this view misremembers the tit-for-tat coaching changes that characterized the first few games. At the suggestion of Luke Walton, Kerr benched Bogut in order to force the Cavs to limit Mozgov's minutes, as Mozgov was playing well but couldn't play perimeter defense against a small ball lineup. The purpose of this change was to further reduce the Cavs' already depleted rotation, and indeed the Cavs were generally able to play the Warriors well until the fourth quarter when fatigue set in. If a history of this era is ever written, I think this moment will be considered some sort of tipping point where small ball emerged as the new paradigm of NBA strategy. The Cavs, and in particular Lebron, have the talent to reverse last year's bad fortune. The Cavs should start a lineup of Lebron, Shump, Frye, Love, Mozgov. If the Warriors bench Bogut again, TT can replace Mozgov. If the Cavs are fully healthy during the Finals they have the personnel to create difficult matchups for the Warriors by starting Lebron at point guard. Lebron James is the only player of his size with the ball handling abilities and court vision to play point guard at an elite level. The Cavs need to find a way to take advantage of that fact when going up against a historically great team whose premier point guard happens to by small and wiry by NBA standards. The matchups on paper would look like this:Curry / LebronThompson / ShumpBarnes / FryeGreen / LoveBogut / MozgovIn actuality they would look something like this: Curry / ShumpThompson / LebronBarnes / LoveGreen / FryeBogut / MozgovThere are clear weaknesses for the Cavs, but this lineup puts Curry and therefore the Warriors in a difficult position. Shumpert is the Cavs' best bet for guarding Curry, and he would certainly be guarding Curry for large stretches even if Kyrie was on the floor. Curry will still get buckets, but this is a tough matchup on the other end for him as he gives up around three inches, thirty pounds, and some athleticism. When Shumpert is healthy he has the conditioning and physique to make life difficult for Curry when the Cavs have the ball, and so the Cavs should do their best to run Curry ragged. Replacing Shump with Smith early brings in a player who is four inches taller and 35 pounds heavier than Curry without giving up too much athleticism. And of course, the Cavs can bring Delly in against Curry for short stretches when Shump and Smith need a break from their difficult defensive task. I think that running Curry ragged when the Cavs have the ball and presenting size mismatches for most of the game is the best bet the Cavs have at beating the Warriors. Starting Lebron at pg and bringing Kyrie / Delly / Williams / Smith / RJ / TT off the bench is imo a risk the Cavs should take. In end of quarter situations James Jones can get the opportunity to splash a three, buying further rest for the Cavs.If they keep their current rotations and play at their current level, the series will be over in 4-5 games. If they are fully healthy, willing to start Lebron at point guard, and present constant size mismatches targeting Curry I think they have a shot.

5528,"I know what you mean. When I first started watching in the mid-00's, I thought defense was just stopping your guy from getting to the basket or taking his right hand away.

Good defense to me means good communication and rehearsed rotations for the help defense. A good zone will be almost impenetrable. If you look at teams with great defenses, they all rotate well when a person is beaten off the dribble, leaving someone on the weak side who is usually well open. They will try and recover though but usually a good defense won't have left a competent shooter open on the weak side. 

To me the huge difference between a good defense and a bad defense, is not only rotations but controlling switches to be a disadvantage to the offense.

5538,No Harden OP?,3,"In the 1940s the All-NBA teams were positionless.  Do you think it would be better to return all-NBA selections to what they originally were?I think the All-NBA teams should capture the best 15 individual seasons in basketball in that year.  Unlike All-Star selections, where sentimentality and the desire to see older stars in the All-Star game play a role in the decisions, there should be no concern about the style of a player's game, his legacy, watchability, etc.Since the league is currently dominated by point guard play and elite outside shooting, I think the three All-NBA teams should be extremely point guard heavy.  Here's my top 15:Curry, Lowry, Westbrook, Leonard, DurantLillard, Isaiah Thomas, Klay Thompson, Lebron, KATChris Paul, Kemba Walker, John Wall, Paul George, Draymond GreenThere are 8 point guards there, but I think that's reflective of the league right now, and the way the game is officiated - if you have one of those eight guys, it's more valuable than having DeMarcus Cousins, Brook Lopez, or Dwight Howard.There are six frontcourt players in the list above (two per team).  If the voting for All-NBA was 2 front court spots, 2 back court spots, and one 'util'/G-F-C slot, it would make the All-NBA teams do a better job of capturing leaguewide trends, player value, and who the best 15 players in the league truly were each season.Last year, for example, Kawhi Leonard had more total votes than Klay Thompson and Kyrie, but they earned third-team selections over him because of how loaded the forward position was last year.  I would like for the voting to avoid those types of scenarios.  A purist would look at those three lineups above and say, 'That doesn't look like a basketball team - so and so would get murdered in the post.'  But all three of those lineups would be even more impossible to guard at the other end.  I don't think you could build a five-man lineup using the remaining players in the league that could beat any of those three All-NBA teams in a pick up game right now.  And that's what the All-NBA teams are about to me - the best 15 dudes.",http://reddit.com/r/nba/comments/4bshhw/c/d1c4kqs,1458846460,nba,Should the All-NBA teams be positionless?,0,4bshhw,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/4bshhw,1458777600

His radio show with Danny Kanell (who despite being a college football analyst, is better to listen to than most of the ESPN NBA people, and he seems to be picking things up really fast) is the best NBA analysis you can find outside of the podcasts. Close second for me is Windhorst, who gets ripped on but when he is analyzing things rather than reporting on them, is really good. I think he is a mediocre at best reporter who is way too close to some of LeBron's people but he's a very good analyst.

5631,"1. I think you are absolutely right about ball dominance, and it is one of the reason that I made this stat. This helps account for it by adjusting for people that have the entire offense run through them, but unfortunately is not able to penalize players who hold the ball for a long time, looking for assist opportunities rather than keeping the ball moving. That said, the correlation you found is obviously somewhat of a self-fulfilling prophecy; players who can pass well are more likely to run the offense. 

2. Again, I am trying to adjust for scheme by making the stat per 100 passes. ATL's bigs get the ball more because the offense moves through the post, but they also pass more so their Value Added per 100 doesn't go up. That said there is no question that teams that design plays to put their bigs in a playmaking position are going to get more assists from bigs. But again, this is a bit of a self-fullfilling prophecy - that is only going ot happen if you have skilled bigs. ",3,"Some of you might remember my post from last season on my new stat: NBA Passer Rating. Passer Rating is a measure of the net value, in points, added to a team by 100 of a given player's passes.The stat was created to get a clearer picture on the value of a player's passes; while assist numbers are heavily influenced by a player's role and level of ball dominance, Passer Rating is not. You can read more about it in last year's post, but here is a breakdown of how it is calculated.The formula has the following inputs:Total Passes (TP)Assists (AST)Free Throw Assists (FTA)PTS created by Assists + FT Assists  (PTSc)Bad pass turnovers (PTOV)Expected Value of Possession (EVP) = Average points of an NBA possession = 1.062Expected Value of a Possession after a turnover (EVP-T) = 1.140The stat is calculated by determiningValue Added By Passing = PTSc / 100 TP - (AST + FTA)*EPVThis formula determines the total number of points created by a player's assists per 100 passes, minus the expected value of all the possessions those assists ended. The difference is the value, in points, that 100 of a players passes add to his team. Value Lost By Passing = PTOV / 100 TP x EVP-TThis simply determines the expected value lost by 100 of a player's passes due to foregoing a possession, plus the additional value lost defensively on the next possession.Passer Rating = Value Added By Passing - Value Lost By PassingHere are your top 10 overall, and by position. Full list in the comments. All stats are per 100 passes.

5747,Even with the heat I don't think Rondo woulda panned out cause lebron needs the ball in his hand.,1,"After a down season last year Rondo has bounced back and is putting up some impressive numbers again. Despite losing some speed to his knee injury, he's having the second best year of his career, and still seems to be in his prime. 2015/2016 Rondo:11.9 points / 12.1 assists / 6.4 rebounds / 2 steals on   .474/.349/.567 shooting splits. Obviously the shooting is pretty ugly, especially free throws, but it always has been. His overall fg% is .449 this year. Compare that to his best year, 2012/2013:13.7 points / 11.1 assists / 5.6 rebounds / 1.8 steals on    .513/.240/.645 splits. Overall fg% was .484. A little more scoring, and more efficiently, but not a massive difference overall, with the extra assist and rebound. His current year is actually almost identical to his 2011/2012 season, which is considered part of his prime. His game doesn't really too much on athleticism so it might age well. I think Rondo is basically going to be a 12/12/6/2 guy for the next few years. He also brings strong leadership to his team and can be a great roaming defender when he's locked in. Right now he's leading the league in assists by 1.8 per game, he's 8th overall in steals, and he's the second best rebounder in the NBA for his position. Obviously guys like Curry, CP3, and Westbrook are way better than him, but who else do you definitively put above him after that? I too am sick of the constant posts ranking players. But Rondo has always been one of my favorite players and it's exciting to see him bounce back to basically his prime numbers after the whole sub was trashing him last year. Is he a top 10 pg again?

5755,"To many people: college basketball has a better atmosphere, less egos (this is a big one for some people), more teams to root for and less predictability (as college kids are less consistent than pros.)

These are the same things college football has going for it over the NFL.

Unlike college football, the actual product in college basketball is generally pretty terrible.  If you stripped away the jerseys/arenas and just focused on the game being played, the execution is pretty terrible and the offenses aren't very good.  I think part of this is attributable to there being so few juniors/seniors these days.

There might be more passes on some teams, but a lot of them are meaningless passes that don't advance the team's offensive position.  They're following the motions.  

When your friends bring up team play, you should ask them if they watch the WNBA for that reason too, because the WNBA certainly has better team play and execution than college teams (they're obviously worse athletes, but so are college teams compared to NBA teams).",10,"I never grew up watching college basketball, no one in my family watched college basketball and so I watch pretty much only NBA. When I try to watch college basketball, the play seems much more erratic. There seems to be a lot more fouls which disrupts the flow of the game. I like the fact that in the NBA I can watch a team evolve over the years with mostly the same players. College basketball players are there for at most 4 years, and the good ones only for 1 year. However my roommates always seem to say I'm an anomaly since college basketball is much better than the NBA. My friend argues that the NBA is not as much of a team sport as NCAA (i.e. there are more passes). He brings up hack-a-Shaqs and the constant hand picking.I think the real reason people like college basketball is because of March Madness and that there are more college teams which means people can associate with a team in their area. Otherwise, I'd rather be watching the pros.What are your thoughts?",http://reddit.com/r/nba/comments/4a90mt/c/d0ycsn7,1457889278,nba,Is college basketball better than the NBA?,0,4a90mt,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/4a90mt,1457827200

Question is why would the Celtics? Jahlil Okafor really isnt a special prospect: bigs who cant defend arent that valuable. ",0,"This thread is about a month late but its something I was interested in. As Celts fans all know Danny Ainge had that famous quote last month where he said he came very close to giving up the BK pick for a big player ""no one would have seen coming"". https://twitter.com/AdamMKaufman/status/700706859611607040There was a report that this was Jahlil Okafor. However, alot of people including Zach Lowe have called BS on this. Lowe has said he thinks it was Kevin Love who they were targeting all along. So Im wondering more just for fun and because we all love baseless speculation, who all do you think that mystery player could have been? Of course there's also a shot Ainge is just lying through his teeth and there was nobody. I'll start off with a couple names, lemme know what you think and chime in with yours. Maybe these arent all that realistic but it's also interesting to think about how some guys might have fit with the teamJimmy Butler: This would have been interesting. They probably would have had to have given up Marcus Smart a BK pick and something else but I would have said it would be worth it. Gordon Hayward: The Butler connection. Not sure how him and Jae Crowder would have fit great but this could have been interesting. Eric Bledsoe: The Suns are a mess and need draft picks. Bledsoe and Brandon Knight arent a great fit. The Celts have pieces the Suns would want although the big question is how does he fit in an already crowded backcourt. Still Im not totally ruling it out. Jabari Parker: He's been coming on lately and could have provided some offensive creativity the Celts would really value. Derrick Favors: There were trade rumors surrounding him at the beginning of the year. He would provide something the Celts defintely could use. Would be an interesting fit. Marc Gasol: Yes Im well aware of his foot injury. But that's what makes it a surprise pick. IT would be a significant gamble on Ainge's part. But if it pans out, it would put the Celts at an entirely different level. This team with Gasol if he was 90% of himself post injury could certainly be an actual challenge to the Cavs. ",http://reddit.com/r/nba/comments/4bfv15/c/d18riq6,1458619072,nba,Who was really the Celtics Mystery Target at the Trade Deadline last month?,6,4bfv15,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/4bfv15,1458604800

5850,"This is a good point, but I think furthers the argument that the impact of hand-checking is overblown.  League wide offensive rating jumped, but merely to just the same values of the mid-90s.

There's evidence that hand-checking had a modest impact on the game.  But hardly the evidence suggested by the old-timers that if they played without hand-checking they'd completely dominate -- and likewise, if these young bucks had to play with hand-checks they would be completely worthless.  

It had a modest impact in the game.  Great players before hand-checking were still great.  Players that were subpar, remained subpar.",2,"I'm on the older side (43), but I'm tired of all this hand-checking talk lately.  I decided to try to look into it a bit.  A standard way baseball analytics folks look across era is to look at year-to-year changes with players who span both years.If you do something similar for hand-checking, you'd expect to see some major changes in numbers.  You'd expect certain players to go from ho-hum to just dropping GOAT numbers.  The crazy thing is, this didn't happen.  Players played largely the same way they did the year before hand-checking appeared.  Steve Nash is someone who in theory would have gained the most from the rule change, but in the first year of the rule change his scoring average goes up by exactly 1 ppg.  And surprisingly his turnovers increase by .5 ppg (you'd think they'd go down without handchecking).  Player after player, you see remarkably consistent performance before and after the hand-checking rule.  And if you look at the leading scorers before and after the rule change, the scoring amounts are about the same -- with one aberration of Kobe Bryant's one year of 35ppg (which drops immediately the year after).So if you look at the data that shows the same players playing with and without the rule, you'll see that offensive productivity didn't magically just change.  With all the talk about the rule making it super easy for offensive players, it apparently was never really exploited until Steph Curry (to hear the old-timers tell it).  If this is really true, he deserves even more credit than he's been given -- as he is about the only player to exploit something that apparently everyone thought was exploitable.",http://reddit.com/r/nba/comments/491459/c/d0om4zy,1457195200,nba,The impact of hand-checking,54,491459,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/491459,1457136000

I disagree that injuries are the only time where something like that would be misleading.

To say beating SA without Kawhi, Alridge, Parker, Ginobili, and Duncan is beating a playoff team is true.  It's also misleading when you leave out that those guys rested.  It's not a quality win.

5950,Sample size.,2,"As requested by /u/Jabbajaw in r/warriors yesterday, here's another bit on the differences in Dubs losses versus Spurs losses.Losses aren’t all that common when we’re talking about the Spurs and Warriors in 2016, but it’s worth taking a look at how  those losses happen when they do. As it turns out, not only do these teams win differently, but they lose differently.Assumptions here are that this late in the season, there won’t be major deviation that would change the conclusions found since all the stats are season-long averages. All pulled from stats.nba.com (Synergy Sports).Here’s the stats for the Warriors and Spurs in losses, compared to their losses:Both had significant decreases in their FG% and in their 3PT%, but those weren’t as drastically different as the numbers above. The Warriors’ dropped about 9 and 11 and the Spurs’ dropped about 6 and 10, respectively.No one’s surprised that there’s a significant drop off in points scored when the team loses, but this is a drastic drop. A couple of the Dubs’ losses have been pretty bad, like getting crushed by Portland and whooped by the Lakers. What I get from the Spurs’ more modest drop-off in losses is that these two teams lose in profoundly different ways.Assertion: The Warriors’ losses are predicated on the failure of their offense, while the Spurs’ losses come from a defensive failure.The Spurs’ points per game are more consistent between losses and wins because they beat teams by dragging them down to their pace level (23rd in the league, just over 95.). When they fail to do that, teams out-shoot their offensive capabilities. That’s not to say they can’t have offensive explosions too, but they’re far less volatile because of their style of play.The Warriors, however, are a walking squad of heat-checks. Possibly the best ever, but the fire does go out on occasion (seven occasions, so far). That massive difference in PPG from wins to losses. Everyone knows the Warriors can bury you, but if you can catch them on a cold night or chase them out of their comfort zone, they become tangible.Look at it this way: both teams drown you, but the Spurs do it by pushing your head below the surface, where the Warriors do it by running a hose to the top of the tank. If you can keep your head above water, you can knock them off.",http://reddit.com/r/nba/comments/4cll2k/c/d1jhaym,1459366974,nba,Rare Occasions: How the Warriors and Spurs Lose,212,4cll2k,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/4cll2k,1459296000

5991,That would require the Rockets finding the playoffs.,33,"There are plenty of differences between these teams, both material and imagined. Old vs. new, fast vs. slow, a winning tradition vs. a (formerly) losing legacy. One that persists is that San Antonio is a paint-oriented team, whereas the Warriors are a jump shooting team--thanks, Sir Charles. In reality, they take almost exactly the same amount of shots in the paint every game. Watching them, though, it’s obvious that that point doesn’t quite pass the eye test because the teams look so different playing. That’s because asking which team works in close-range is the wrong question. The right question is: how do the top two teams in the league get their close range points?Before moving forward, quick points: here, I’ve defined a “close range shot” as an attempt from 0-9ft, and made a couple of assumptions that while imperfect, shouldn’t be far off, like that most transition attempts will be in that range, as well shots taking by the roll man in an offensive possession. All stats were pulled from stats.nba.com on 3/25/2016 (this late in the season, there’s not likely to be significant shifts in per-game numbers anyway).The Spurs and the Warriors take pretty much the same amount of shots from 0-9 per game, and have generated just about the same number of touches in the paint  per game (TPG) over the season--37.5SPG and 16.9 versus 36.3 and 17.0, respectively. There are five types of plays I looked at that tend to happen inside that range offensively, checking the Spurs’ and the Warriors’ frequency and scoring efficiency for each: offensive post-ups, cuts, pick and rolls where the roll man is the handler, putbacks, and transition plays.Play Frequency and Scoring Efficiency, GSW and SAS tableThere are more than a few things that come out of these numbers that are interesting. For one, both teams get putback attempts on about 5% of offensive plays, ranking them at 8th (GSW) and 7th (SAS). However, there’s a huge gap in scoring efficiency. Golden State scores on less than half of putback attempts for .91 points per possession, while San Antonio converts two-thirds of theirs, good for 1.3 PPP. Looking at their offensive talent, it’s not particularly surprising. Tim Duncan and LaMarcus Aldridge are worlds ahead of Andrew Bogut and Festus Ezeli in terms of touch around the rim. Something else to note is that while San Antonio runs plays for the offensive roll man more often and likewise for cuts with Golden State, their effectiveness in both situations is a wash.What we’ll really want to look at here is the huge differences in two categories, post-ups and transition play.The post-up differences are interesting. Both teams produce a similar number of touches in the post every game: 22.1 for the Spurs (1st in the NBA) and 20.4 for the Warriors (good for 3rd in the league). The former just runs plays out of those touches far more often. San Antonio runs offensive post plays just over 14% of possessions, converting on just over 50% of them versus just 6.1% frequency and 40.0% for Golden State (1.00 vs. .91 PPP). The difference in frequency against touches is probably a product of Golden State’s bevy of shooters, resulting in quick passes to the perimeter out of the post more often. Not only is San Antonio more post-oriented, but they’re definitely more effective with it too. Again, not that surprising if you’re familiar with the build of their roster.Where the Dubs win big here is in transition. A whopping 17.5% of their offensive possessions occur in transition, versus just 10.9% for the Spurs. They have similar scoring frequency at a hair over 50%, but the much higher occurrence for the Warriors gives them 1.16 PPP against 1.07 PPP. Granted, this could be a bit stilted by their penchant for fast-break threes, but most of these possessions will still end within 10 feet of the basket. Again, given the personnel, not terribly surprising. The Warriors lead the league in pace, and everyone knows they like to run.This points to an interesting note from the most recent game, a defensive grinder that the Spurs won. Both teams defend well, with historic point differentials, but the Spurs are better. These teams define the “unstoppable force, immovable object” adage. If you want to know where those points the Spurs won by came from, a glance at defensive metrics gives us a look: their best offensive weapon up close is the post, and the Warriors are a pedestrian post-defense team, allowing a bottom-five amount of PPG in the post. The Spurs, by contrast, are a top-three transition defensive team--one of the Warriors’ biggest offensive weapons.
What does all of this mean? Mostly, it’s just numbers backing up some things that the eye test would allow us to guess anyway. Both teams are effective inside scorers, but they get those points in very different ways. It also tells us that maybe the way to beat the Warriors, beyond limiting the perimeter attack and transition, is to attack them in the post. Boasting some of the best talent in the league, there’s no question these titans will play great games every time. But under a microscope, the suspicion has serious material evidence: there’s no team as perfectly suited to defang Golden State as the Spurs. Come playoffs, maybe it’ll be enough.

6041,"I'll take it. 

Factor in his increased defense and he's having an incredible season. ",12,"Thanks to our friends at basketball reference, we have shooting data on every player in the league, broken down by distance and percentage. So I looked at how Curry is performing on the year shooting the ball versus other notable scorers.As you would expect, Curry's numbers are just absurd. His average shot distance is from 17.2 feet away (just shy of your old high school 3-point line), and yet he's hitting at an overall clip of .510 on 20 attempts per game. For comparison, LeBron's average FGA is from 9.9 feet away, and he's shooting just .504 on 18.8 shots per game. But, LeBron has never been a particularly great shooter, and he's having an off season. So let's look at some more comparable scorers:Harden: 14.4 ft and .433 on 19.7 shots per game. Lillard: 14.9 ft - .431 - 20.2Paul George: 16.4 ft - .416 - 18.2JJ Redick: 19.5 ft - .474 - 11.9DeRozan: 11.1 - .446 - 17.6Melo: 13.6 - .432 - 18.1Klay: 16.4 - .468 - 17.1Kawhi: 13.3 - .509 - 15.0(Curry: 17.2 - .510 - 20.0)Really, only 3 of these guys are comparable: Redick, Klay and Kawhi. Redick strokes it at over 47% from almost 20 feet away, but he's only taking 11 shots a game (about half of what Curry is putting up). Klay hits at close to 47% from over 16 feet on 17 shots a game, which is extremely impressive, but he falls a good amount short of Steph in volume and FG%. Kawhi hits at the best percentage, just shy of 51, but he takes 5 less shots a game and shoots from 4 feet closer on average.So 3 of the best shooting-scorers in the league and Curry is blowing each of them out of the water. Plus, his nearest competitor is almost assuredly benefiting efficiency wise from Curry being out there with him. Curry should be the best shooter in the league by a mile, and everyone acknowledges that he is, because it would only make sense with his current tour of destruction taking place at an arena near you. Except, unfortunately for Steph, he's sharing his prime with this guy:Kevin Durant: 14.6 ft - .507 - 19.0 FGA/gSure, Curry bests Durant in each category. He shoots from farther away, hits at a better %, and he takes more shots. But the fact that Durant is, you know, three tenths of a percent worse while taking 95% as many shots just two and a half feet closer to the basket is, frankly, unbelievable. Unfortunately, shot tracking data only goes back about 15 years, but it's basically impossible to find any season since 2000 that compares to even Durant. Dirk scratches the ceiling, but when his attempts are as high as Curry and KD his FG% isn't as good, and when his FG% is there he's either taking less shots or shooting closer to the hoop (or both). His closest year was 2014 where he took 15.9 shots a game 16.7 feet away and hit .497. But still, that's 4 less attempts per game than Curry with a lower %. Nash had a couple .500+ seasons (his best was .504 with 17.2 feet) but he never took more than 14 shots a game.Guys I'm curious about are Bird, MJ and Adrian Dantley, but I don't think any of them shot as far away from the basket as Curry or Durant (Bird, contrary to legend, took very few 3s in his career).It's very, very possible that when accounting for volume Curry and Durant are basically having the 2 best shooting seasons in league history in the same season. So the next time Oscar Robertson stops you on the street and talks about the glory days, drop some knowledge on him.

6100,"Yes, it is very disrespectful to Curry to say Stockton was ever this good. Curry is having arguably the best individual season since Wilt",2,"I'm not here to say that John Stockton was the greatest point guard of all time. His game was not nearly as well rounded as some like Chris Paul or Magic. He was not exactly a prolific scorer and the fact that he never won a ring always enters into these discussions. That being said, his numbers seem to jump off of the page at you. He was a 10 time all star, 5 time all defense second team, member of the dream team, averaged a career double-double, retired with FG% above .50, and holds the record for assist total by FAR as well as the steals record by significant margin. Looking at the list of assisters in league history, Jason Kidd sits at two but with almost 4000 total assists less than Stockton. He also sits roughly 600 steals ahead of Kidd on the steals list as well. I have been trying to wrap my mind around the amount of assisting this man did so I tried to parallel him to a somewhat similar, current player.  I went with Chris Paul, who is a great guard who can score but excels at assisting and making those around him better and has also never won a ring. Paul will inevitably go down as one of the best guards and assisters of our generation. He currently sits comfortably at 11th all time in assists. This is impressive seeing as he has only been in the league since '05. That being said there is little chance that he will ever get the roughly 8,000 more assists in his career needed to pass Stockton. I tend to think trying to rank players is pointless because in the end there really isn't a right answer but i like hearing peoples' reasoning for who outranks who. Most people fall back to ring counting which works in many cases but leaves out great players like Barkley, Nash, Malone, Miller, Ewing, and Baylor. Arguably the most objective way to make rankings is to go by real numbers and when you look at lists of the top players in the 5 major categories: points, assists, rebounds, blocks, and steals. The players at the top or near the top of those lists are almost always near the top of many peoples' lists of greatest players of all time and Stockton is the only player currently topping two of those five categories. I guess the question is where is the right place to rank the man with the most cookies and dimes of all time? I rarely hear his name in discussion of best PG of all time, so where do you place him among the best point guards or guards in general?",http://reddit.com/r/nba/comments/4bno28/c/d1axti3,1458764619,nba,Where is the right place to rank Stockton among the PG greats?,13,4bno28,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/4bno28,1458691200

6126,"Yeah there's situations on defense in basically every game where the smart play is to count your losses and accept that the other team is going to score. This is pretty much the basis of help defense. There are a lot of complicated factors that go into a player deciding what the ""right"" time to give up on a play is. Time left in the game, foul situation, the offensive players abilities, the defensive player's abilities, angles, positioning, the context of the game within the season as a whole, etc. etc. etc. 



It's a fine line and there's no doubt that notoriously low effort defenders are often on the wrong side of that line but in hindsight it usually looks worse than it really is. 


Edit: You could probably find footage of just about every player in the league giving up on a play well before they should have and looking pretty bad because of it.

6221,"Yeah, I was thinking he'd be good for a team like Houston off the bench for perimeter defense and some offensive help at times. ",1,"Hi, everyone. A while ago I made a thread asking if r/nba would be interested in a thread that talks about top draft prospects once a week/month leading up to the draft. It got enough interest where I figured that I would start it up. The reason I think this would be good for r/nba is because some players can be great fits for the college game (Psycho T, Adam Morrison, Jimmer Fredette come to mind) being all time great college players, but appear to not have a game that translates well to the next level. I realize obviously you can never tell for certain if a player is going to boom or bust, but I think it would be cool to get more of a full perspective on each players draft profile.I will write in depth about a couple of players as well as a summary of a bunch of other prospects game, but feel free to comment a college player’s name and request a breakdown of their game. Diamond Stone (Maryland)-FreshmanWhat to like: 
To start, Stone possesses a great build for the NBA. He’s 6 foot 11 in shoes and weighs 255 pounds (for reference Kevin Love and Steven Adams weigh about 250). He has some ass long arms (7’ 3.5’’ wingspan, 9’ 1’’ standing reach) and does a good job with his post defense standing straight up and using his physical attributes to contest shots (1.7 blocks per game). Stone shoots very efficiently with a field goal percentage of 56.4%, and averages 12.8 points per game with most of his points coming off the pick and roll or from the block. He improved his free throw percentage from high school (which was in the high 50’s) to making 76.6% of his season and showing he may be a capable mid-range shooter at the NBA level. Stone runs the floor pretty well for a big, and already has great footwork in the post, already possessing a go-to move in his drop step. He gets a body on a player when going for rebounds (5.6 total rebounds in 22 minutes per game) and gets offensive rebounds (2.3 offensive boards in his 22 minutes). If Stone can have a little more hustle he could be a better defensive rebounder at the NBA level. Diamond has also shown the ability to be the “man” and go off, going off for 39 points against Penn State this year, clearly displaying great confidence in his abilities. Diamond has also shown the ability to be the “man” and go off, going off for 39 points against Penn State this year, clearly displaying great confidence in his abilitiesWhat not to like: He has lost his temper a couple of times and gets into some scuffles (was involved in a couple 2/27/16 against Purdue, giving a shove and later having some words with a Purdue player to result in a double technical). He even ended up getting suspended a game because he couldn’t stay composed. Obviously he’s young (19 years old), but he’s going to need to work on his composure at the next level. He also needs to work a little bit on using his size more to create more space for easier shots down low, because lankier centers seem to be able to block him easily due to his poor vertical. His motor also seems to be questionable at times. He boxes out okay most of the time, but he will not chase down defensive boards. He will get caught not fighting around good post seals or screens as much as you’d like. Diamond Stone had a couple of opportunities to chase down a defensive rebound or try to get around a post player to contest a shot in Maryland’s loss to Purdue down the stretch, but he failed to do so. Motor has been a major problem for him since high school, and hopefully he can improve it.Jaylen Brown (California)-FreshmanWhat’s to like:
Jaylen Brown has great physical tools for a small forward, standing 6 foot 7 with a wingspan that is pterodactyl-like being just over 7 feet. And his length doesn’t come at the cost of his strength and weight, with Brown weighing a little over 220 pounds and knowing how to use every pound to create some space. He is extremely explosive, especially with his first step, and in a transition he can either take it and go by himself or correctly fill the lanes to get an easy bucket. He can put up some highlight reel finishes with contact and can get to the line often (6.5 Free Throw Attempts a game). Because of his ability to get to the rim and finish there is a lot of potential for him to be a great scorer in the NBA (Brown averages 15.5 points per game in a little over 27 minutes of play). This video of his scoring highlights vs. Richmond earlier this season clearly display his scoring potential for the NBA level What not to like:
Jaylen Brown’s shooting ability is pretty shaky at the college level. He shoots only 31.9% from the shorter college 3, and despite his great ability to get to the free throw line; he only makes 64.4% of his attempts there. He also can have trouble taking care of the ball and making good decisions, averaging 3 turnovers a game in a little over 27 minutes of play. Brown has a tendency to force the issue and commit stupid turnovers, as well as drive into traffic, causing him to force up some bad shots.  He also has a problem over dribbling and losing the ball because of it. Buddy Hield (Oklahoma)-Senior: Buddy Hield (a 6 foot 4, 214 pound guard) is the biggest offensive threat in this draft class, averaging 25.3 points a game on 49.3 FG%, 89 FT%, and 47.6 3PT%. But the most astonishing part of his game is that his 47.6 3PT% is on almost 9 three point attempts per game. His release on his 3-point shot is quicker than the norm with already NBA range, and he is nearly automatic if a defender doesn’t get a hand up. Biggest knocks on him are he’s already 22 years old and his defense and athleticism aren’t great, but his floor at the NBA level should be a spot up shooter, making him one of the safer picks in the draft.Kris Dunn (Providence)-Junior Dunn’s the best point guard in this draft class, standing 6 foot 4 and weighing 205 pounds (not to mention having a 6 foot 9 wingspan). He is a do it all type of guard, averaging 16.4 points a game, 5.8 boards, 6.3 assists, and 2.8 steals in 33 minutes a game.  He has great handles for the NBA level, nice playmaking ability, and does a good job attacking the basket having some nice acrobatic finishes. But despite his ability to get to the basket, he can make poor decisions, averaging 3.5 turnovers a game and shooting around 44% from the field. He also needs to work on his outside jump shot a little more because he is only shooting 35% from the college 3 and 69.6% from the free throw line. He’s projected to be a top 5 pick as of right now.Ben Simmons (LSU)-Freshman Simmons is as of right now the top prospect in this draft class. He’s a 6 foot 10, 240 pound forward, that in 35 minutes a game is putting up 19.7 points, 12.1 rebounds (3.1 offensive), 5.1 assists, 1.9 steals, and 0.9 blocks on a 56.6% Field Goal percentage. He isn’t a perfect prospect however despite what his stat line says averaging 3 turnovers a game and showing little ability to hit jumpers and shoot the ball (He’s only taken three 3 pointers this year, hitting one. He also shoots only 68.5% from the free throw line despite getting an elite 9.1 free throw attempts a game). It is also worth noting that his team will most likely not make the NCAA tournament which is extremely odd for someone projected to go #1 overall (Slightly empty stats maybe?). He is most likely going to be a point forward at the next level, and while he probably won’t live up to the LeBron comparisons (how many can?), he could be a great player at the next level.Brandon Ingram (Duke)-Freshman Ingram is a very talented scorer and as of right now considered the 2nd best prospect in the draft besides Ben Simmons. He has a build similar to Kevin Durant coming out of college, standing 6 foot 9 but weighing only 196 pounds. He has shown the ability to take over games scoring the basketball which were key in big wins for Duke against Louisville (18 points 10 boards when Louisville was ranked the 13th best team in the nation), Virginia (25 points 7 boards when Virginia was the 7th best team in the nation), and North Carolina (20 points 10 boards with UNC ranked 5th in the nation). Ingram’s college averages in 34 minutes of playtime per game are 16.9 points, 6.8 boards, 1.9 assists, 1.1 steals, and 1.4 blocks per game. He shoots the ball from deep extremely well (40.6% from 3 point land on over 5 attempts a game).

6256,Hey guys thanks for the love. If you have any Rudy specific questions please ask. Also u/Fatal_conceit was a joy to work with.,2,"I’m going to HIGHLY HIGHLY recommend trying Imagus browser extension before reading. I got it from the streamables tool page and it plays streamables with a mouse hover over the link. Shit’s awesome. WHAT THE HELL IS RUDY GOBERT? a collaboration between /u/Skiptomyl0u and /u/Fatal_conceit The albatross of the NBA. With a wingspan longer than that of Wilt Chamberlain, front offices across the league regret shooting him down on draft night (27th pick!), and now he hangs around their necks like a curse. And between the 7ft 8 and ½ inches of ball smothering terror flails he calls arms, is a man whose frame betrays the human eye. The age of the mobile bigs is upon us, and the French Rejection, the Stifle Tower, Rudy Gobert, is as big as they come.  DEFENSEIn the era of /u/splash2ndcousin streamables, players are more weary than ever to avoid embarrassment, and for rim protectors getting posterized is the height of embarrassing mishaps. Seriously, how many times do you see a big man take a casual step out of the way of a hard driving guard on a late rotation? But that’s not Rudy. On March 30th Andrew Wiggins posterized Rudy. Badly. Twice. But rather than check out and keep his head down, Rudy is the kind of guy with the mindset that the paint is his not yours, and every attempt at entering his home is done at your own peril. It takes a special temperament to be this even-keeled and along with his temperament comes a defensive IQ that allows him to really anchor the defense in ways that reflect well in both simple stats and advanced analytics. A prime example of this is Rudy’s ability to alter shots, leaving shooters at a league low 40% FG against. If you don’t immediately recognize how batshit crazy that statistic is, it tells you that having Ricky Rubio launch three pointers is a more efficient scoring strategy than attacking Gobert at the basket. Combined with his length and speed he is an absolute nightmare on the court. He has length that can help deny entry passes, a high defensive BBIQ, good elevation, and incredible [footwork] for a guy his size. And with Rudy’s defense, comes seemless transitions into offense. Oh yeah and rebounds… he’s snagging 11 of those bad boys down a game. OFFENSERudy Gobert is more than just your average garbage man. For sure he is an elite lob target. For sure his putbacks are nasty. For sure he is a terrible shooter air ball. But today’s game is about efficiency not pure volume, and for Rudy good decision making leads him to a very high 60% eFG. And while his free throws are good enough to avoid some of the monotony of end game fouling that plagues the loyal fans of Drummond and Deandre, there isn’t a lot of bragging room for a 59% shooter. Rudy has good vision for Slenderman. However, he also has poor hands whenever any pass comes below his waist and with a whopping  turnover percentage of 18.1%, he gives the opposing team ample opportunities themselves. But if he can tighten some of these errors up I think he flashes some serious potential as a passer. It’s not every day you see big men with this kind of awareness in a big man and combined with an insanely high vantage point Quinn Snyder may be tapping into something special. But if all else fails, Rudy can always just dunk it in your face. /u/Fatal_conceit : Despite just starting his career, Rudy has made a game of destroying the league's top tier talent. For example, if you played on the All-Star team this year and haven’t been hurt for a significant part of Rudy’s career, he has probably swatted your shit. Also Kobe told me Rudy Gobert is the reason he's retiring early.   TL;DR: Rudy is a young freak of defensive nature. He has a ton of room to grow offensively and he has a bright future on a young Utah team.

6263,I always thought Love was going to be the better player. Now not so much,1,"So I'm a big clippers fan. I watch every minute of every game so I think I  have a pretty good feel for the team. Early last year (or maybe a year before) Bill Simmons suggested that the clippers would be a better team if they traded Blake for 3 decent guys. I laughed that off. Blake is a legit MVP candidate. He can pass, score inside and out, can defend on the ball and on switches. He is a super player, but he might not be the best fit. When CP3 went down last season we got to see the best of Blake. He was simply amazing, and the best player in the league during that stretch. Now this season Blake is out and we get to see how CP3 plays without him. They are playing great, but stylistically the offense is completely different. Its almost unrecognizable. Lets look at the differences. 1.
 With Blake out almost every on ball screen is set by DJ. I didn't appreciate this until this season but he is a much better screener than Blake. Like, a lot. Blake tends to set wussy screens and pop out half the time. Obviously Blake is great as the roll man with his touch inside and athleticism, but it doesn't always help CP. When DJ screen he screens hard. He sticks out those hips just enough to not get called, smashes the opposing guard off balance and freaking bolts for the rim. I mean some of those lob dunks are simply ridiculous. So what is the difference? Its all about spacing. The NBA is moving towards a style of pick and roll with 3 shooters. The Clippers certainly do this an awful lot, and with only one big on the floor, the opposing rim protector has to come out and help on those picks otherwise CP3 will totally burn them. You can't do that with two bigs who aren't a threat from 3. The result is the Clippers have a go to play: CP3/DJ pick and roll at the elbow. CP turns the corner as DJ's man contains. If he helps too much DJ puts on the jets and its a dunk. If they contain well CP3 will turn the corner, snake across the top of the key and shoot that little left to right fader he is so good at, or they get a switch/other action. Its a fool proof way to set up the offense or get a decent look late in the clock. If you trade Blake for a package with a shooter at the 3 and 4, you have a mean pick and roll.I present to you, trade option 1! Ok these trades are not super realistic but its the trade the Clippers should try and get in my opinion. Milsap is a natural 3 in my opinion and Horford prefers the 4. They are both great defenders, they both play really well without the ball. They are both great players. The cap is going up so you can afford to sign them both to bigger deals if need be. The starting lineup of CP3, Reddick, Milsap, Horford, DJ is simply scary. Would be the best starting 5 in the league probably. This kinda relies on both guys walking in free agency, and Blake agreeing to resign if he goes to atlanta. Both guys are a bit older but they are well withing the CP3 window. Atlanta gets a young star to go with some of their up and comers. 2.
I was said to see coach Lue go and I was skeptical about Woodson coming in to oversee the defense. DJ is an amazing presence in the paint. He is quick enough to help and get back to his man, rediculous shot changer/blocker. Opposing teams hated this so they would put him in the P&R and leave Blake to gaurd the rim. Blake is quite frankly a huge failure of a paint protector so they tried to get away from this. The new system designed for this season was to have the guards help out on DJ's man rolling, and there are a few switches but everyone else ends up on a man while DJ gets to sit in the paint. This forces opponents to cough up bad midrange shots or contested 3s. The problem is this requires immense trust and the knowledge that if you leave your guy the system will cover you. It took ages for this to click and I was skeptical but now it has Holy Shit Batman its a thing of beauty. The clips are now a top 5 defense and top 2 in recent months. Blake is not a great defender. On defending the post he is above average (last time I checked) and he is pretty good trying to guard the perimeter on switches. This is all fine. Unfortunately he is in the same category as Kevin Love: they both just get lost in defensive action. Blake tries to buy in but he just notices things too slowly, or over commits. He hedges too high, gets lost in the pick and roll and his defensive rebounding is down (though this is Doc Rivers idea to keep Blake healthy in the regular season, in the playoffs he is great on the boards). I am always a fan of defense first guys to compliment super stars. Especially 3 and D guys.So here is number 2. Really this trade is BG for Crowder and Bradley and someone else. Then chuck in some throw away contracts or picks to balance it out. The vision here is to make the clips into a defensive Juggernaut. If you can get away with Bradley at the 3 (ie not on Lebron, KD, Melo, or PG) you have a super fun defensive lineups. You can predict a heap of steals with this lineup and it would produce a heap of fast break points off tunrovers. Jae Crowder is one of my favorite players (Behind Lance RIP :{ ) and super underrated. Probably Cs best player. Bradley is becoming Reddick MKII. He runs around like a bloody mad man on set plays and gets open. I would be fun to have action where they both run off down screens and the defense has to just gamble and cover one of them. Well thats enough for now, I might edit in some denver trade ideas later.

6276,Phil Jackson and the Spanish Bros - Round 2,5,"With the 39th win for the Indiana Pacers, 8 Eastern Conference teams have at least 39 wins, so the worst record that can possibly make the playoffs in the East is 39-43.  This immediately eliminates the 44 loss Bucks and Knicks, who cannot finish with a better record than 38-44.The Orlando Magic, meanwhile, only have 43 losses and could conceivably tie the Pacers or Pistons by winning their remaining games in the event that whichever of the Pistons or Pacers loses all of their remaining games.  However, if that situation were to occur, the Magic would lose the head to head season series, 3-1 to the Pacers or 2-1 to the Pistons.  As a result, you would need a multi-way tie.  At this point, however, the only teams that can be involved in such a multi-way tie are the Bulls and Wizards, but since the Magic are 0-4 against the Wizards, this leaves only 4 teams in the potential ties (And any 2 way ties are meaningless since all 3 end with the Pacers and Pistons making the playoffs):  The Bulls, Pacers, Pistons, and Magic.A 3 way tie between the Pacers, Pistons, and Magic does not work -- the first tiebreaker is head to head record within the group and the Pacers would win that with a record of 6-2, compared to the Pistons at 3-4 and the Magic at 2-5.  After that the Pistons' 2-1 record over the Magic gives them the last spot.A 3 way tie between the Pacers, Pistons, and Bulls does not work -- The Magic would have to have a worse record than those 3 teams and would be eliminated.A 3 way tie between the Pacers, Bulls, and Magic does not work -- For this tie to occur, it would have to be at 39-43 and the Pistons would have to have won an additional game.  This leaves 1 spot, which would be claimed by the Bulls, with a record within the group of 4-3, compared to the Pacers at 4-4 and the Magic at 3-4.A 3 way tie between the Pistons, Bulls, and Magic does not work -- Much like the last tie, the Pacers would have to be better than 39-43, leaving one spot that would go to the Pistons, who would be 4-3 within the tied teams, compared to the Magic at 3-3 and Bulls at 3-4.A 4 way tie between all 4 teams, finally, does not work -- With 2 spots open, the first spot would go to the Pacers, with a record within the group of 7-5, compared to the Magic's 4-6, the Bulls 6-5, and the Pistons 5-6.

6364,"Notes:

* All data is from NBA.com.
* FG% for Shots Defended at Rim = FG% when the defender is within 5 feet of the basket and within 5 feet of the player attempting the shot.
* Cutoff for being on the graph was defending 200 shots at the rim.
* Sorry for the graph being very crowded. I could've made the cutoff higher, but I didn't want to exclude too many big men. They just all happen to be clustered around the same general areas.
* For reference, the league average FG% for Shots Defended at Rim is 51.8%. This includes ALL defenders, not just big men. So we should expect most of these players to be below that.

Observations:

* It looks like FG% for Shots Defended at Rim is very dependent on team defense because a lot of teammates have similar percentages. 
  * Of course this isn't always true, and when teammates have really different percentages, I think it's especially indicative of good or bad defenders.
  * [Here's a picture](http://i.imgur.com/sLepyHA.png) of all the players and their stats sorted by team.
* It's great to see Whiteside with a top 15 defensive FG% at the rim. He's also much better than teammates Bosh and Deng, ~~so I wouldn't be surprised if bad team defense is partially holding him back.~~ [Miami is actually 6th in DRTG](http://stats.nba.com/league/team/#!/advanced/?sort=DEF_RATING&amp;dir=-1), so I was wrong there.
* I've heard a lot of complaints about Ibaka before (mostly similar to Whiteside, that he only goes for blocks). I'm impressed with his rim protection.
* Porzingis and Towns are in the same category as Davis. It's good to see they're playing well on both ends (particularly Towns).
* The Gasol brothers are 12 and 13 in defensive FG%. I always hear that Pau has horrible defense now, so this was surprising.
* The Lopez brothers are almost identical.
* I'm shocked to see Dwight and Asik so mediocre. It seems like only yesterday when they were both viewed as two of the top rim protectors (and both on the Rockets).
* I always assumed Thompson had much better rim protection than Love, but that doesn't appear to be the case.
* Tyson Chandler seems to have *really* slipped from his peak defensive days.",72,,http://reddit.com/r/nba/comments/48n2qw/c/d0kw14d,1456938767,nba,Who are the best rim protectors this season?

I can't even imagine the toll it would take on you mentally to work so hard rehabbing and stepping onto the court and then being torn down in an instant, over and over. Props to Derrick for changing his game and still being a good player. Why I have serious faith in DRose:1) He had an excellent series against the Cavs (not just the game winning buzzer beater) until he hurt his wrist and had an entire off-season to get better, which he said he would work the hardest he would ever work since getting into the league.2) He absolutely took over against KD and Westbrook's Thunder earlier in the season when he hit stepback after stepback after bank shot to put away the game.3) He played with limited/blurred vision for the first part of the season. Consequently his depth perception and everything else would be hindered, making him rely on bank shots even more so and limiting his jump shooting/etc.4) He always steps ups his game when faced against an elite PG. He put Kyrie on multiple spin cycles last year, torched Westbrook this year, etc.I love this guy. I love how humble he is. It's so interesting to me how people hate on him for the smallest things. I love that he hit game winners against both teams in the finals last year. More so I love that amidst the doubt and criticism his drive and love for the game never wavered. From a Spurs fan: Welcome back DRose. The window for Chicago isn't closed, looking forward to see what you do in the playoffs and the years coming.Please notice I never said anything about him being MVP Rose, being back, or being in MVP form, or anything of the variation.

Edit: nvm didn't read the top bit properly.",1,"As part of their 90's week at Hardwood Paroxysm they've been profiling the ""survivors"", the last players left from the 90's, so far the articles have been interesting and a good read for anyone who enjoys NBA nostalgia. I'm gonna miss watching these guys. Hopefully they'll publish some more, they're still missing Kobe, Dirk, Duncan, Manu and Pierce (and technically Nazr Mohammed, who's back working with OKC!).They've also done 90's-centric articles about Knicks/Heat, Glen Rice, KJ's suns, Payton/Kemp and the Dream Team. How do you write about Kevin Garnett in 2016?Garnett changed the way we saw the power forward position. Garnett came into the league unwilling to just be a post-up player though he certainly could. He had the range to stretch a defense from the midrange, and the ability to work down on the block. And when he brandished that step back jumper on the baseline, it was over. The joke is that Garnett’s height is 6-12, not 7-foot, and that’s what made that shot so difficult to contest.The last Kobe Bryant post I'll ever writeThis season has been a sharp break for him, but he was not a static figure during his NBA career either. He entered the league confident and bold, but this single-minded intensity was a slow burn. He used it as armor, defending himself from critics, from failure, from the situation in Colorado. Intensity sustained him and perhaps he was too afraid of what would happen if he let go of it. He never found another way to be because the risks of trying on a different persona just seemed too big.Elton Brand’s journey from No. 1 pick to ‘Old School Chevy’""The truth is, my decision to return to the NBA isn’t about money, and it isn’t about rings. It isn’t even about me, really, although every athlete would like to go out on his or her own terms. It’s about repaying what’s owed, about making sure that the young men who follow in my footsteps get what they’re entitled to (and what I haven’t always given them)."" Vince Carter is a finished productCarter’s athleticism was rocket fuel for our imaginations. Stretching all the way back to his days as a Tar Heel, the appeal of Vince was about guessing at his ceiling, allowing your mind to wander with exactly what he could and couldn’t do with that body, those legs, and those arms. Even in the middle part of his career, when the frequency of his thunderous dunks had ebbed, giving way to post-ups and three-pointers, he always left the perception that he was just scraping the surface.Jason Terry was my hype manGraphics were pretty simplistic in this era, but Terry stood out with his knee-high white socks. He could shoot three-pointers, pick anyone’s pocket, and knife through the stiff computerized defenders. I used Terry pretty much the way Russell Westbrook plays now, draped over opposing ball-handlers, turning turnovers into locomotive drives to the rim or wild pull-ups behind the three-point line. I’m proud to say that in my virtual reality, Jason Terry was a league MVP and NBA championship winner, many times over.Andre Miller, basketball professor emeritus, tossed lobsMiller’s oops came 40 feet from the rim, because why waste all that energy running around on offense if you can, you know, just pass the ball to someone shortly after crossing halfcourt? The way Steph Curry shoots the ball now is how Andre Miller passed the ball for alley-oops — casual indifference while effortlessly moving the ball exactly where it should be.",http://reddit.com/r/nba/comments/49zrnt/c/d0x0zyd,1457775177,nba,[Hardwood Paroxysm] Survivors: Profiling the active players who were drafted in the 90's,41,49zrnt,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/49zrnt,1457654400

Meanwhile, CJ is taking 39% more attemps and shooting just as many FT's as last year (2.7)People deny it, but CJ's improvement is a result of more minutes and more attempts. This season, his True Shooting % is the exact same as last season's; Curry's has jumped by 4.7%...I do not watch enough Trail Blazers games to know if CJ has improved his defense by a notable extent but I don't think I've read anything on the subject.Traditionally, end of season awards are given to players on good teams. While the Blazers are exceeding expectations, Steph is on possibly the greatest team of all time.As for the Wil Barton, Lowry, and Crowder MIP fans, they've made great strides but I don't think any reasonable argument could be made for their improvement over Curry's.TLDR: CJ is a popular choice for MIP. Per 36, Curry has greater increase in PPG (while increasing his attempts by 15% vs CJ's 39%). CJ's TS% is the exact same; Curry's is +5%. Historically, end-of-year awards go to players on good teams; Curry is on the best team.EDIT:
New TLDR: Curry improved the most but he already has so much so he doesn't deserve it. An MVP has never won it before, so therefore it will never happen and should never happen.EDIT: Since this is getting some attention, I want to state that every fan of any team would behave the exact same way as Warriors fans if given the roster.

6528,Lakers wouldn't of had Pau and CP3. Pau was headed to Houston ,2,"Was thinking alot about fake trades, real trades, trade rumors etc earlier and got me thinking about some of the most influential trades of the past decade. NOTE: Im defining influential in terms of trades that most influenced title teams and title races. So the biggest trades by this criteria are either creating title teams or making them better. So a trade like Nets trading 5 first rd picks to the Celtics is big but it didnt shift any title races or help make any team a title team. A trade like the Pistons for 'Sheed obviously qualifies as a significant one. Here are some my nominations lets hear what you got. What do you think?  I ranked them below. Note: If you want to go past 10 years some that's fine. Im just creating a random time point to start the discussion. Also Im not including LeBron/Bosh in this discussion even though it technically was a trade. Here are my rankings 1)  2011: George Hill for the Kawhi Leonard(the Spurs traded George Hill specifically knowing they were targeting Leonard)
The Spurs may very well not win the title in 2014 without Kawahi. The sure as hell wouldn’t be anywhere close to as well set up to future success without him. The Spurs will likely win another title or two in the next decade and Kawahi will be the major reason why. This team would have never been able to rebuild post Tim Duncan without him 3)  2008: Grizzlies trade Pau Gasol to the Lakers for Kwame Brown Marc Gasol 2008 and 2010 first round picks: This was interesting because Pau brought the two titles right away for the Lakers. But Marc Gasol ended up being just as good a player. But would the Lakers have realized this and let him develop into what he became? Would Marc Gasol in 2011-14 be enough for the Lakers as Kobe was aging and Lamar Odom was gone and Steve Nash was washed up? Probably not. But this trade created two titles and the Grindhouse in Memphis. 4)  2012: Bucks trade Andrew Bogut and Stephen Jackson to the Warriors for Monta Ellis Kwame Brown and Ekpe Udoh: I don’t think the Warriors basketball the way we know it ever develops if Monta Ellis wasn’t removed from the team as soon as possible. Monta stunted Golden State’s development entirely. Remember before they became this juggernaut they had to become a 50+ win playoff team in 2013-14 first. I don’t think that ever happens with Monta. 5)  2007: Celtics trade Al Jefferson Gerald Green Ryan Gomes Sebastian Telfair and 2 2009 1st rd picks to the T Wolves for KG 
The 6 years Celtics run never comes close to happening without this.6)  2007: Sonics Trade Ray Allen to the Celtics for Delonte West Wally Sczcerbiak and Jeff Green: Boston would have been really good without Ray but they probably don’t win the title in 2008 and they aren’t the Celtics we remember without him. The reason these two trades aren’t higher is because just one of them alone wouldn’t have gotten the Celtics to the title. If you combined these two trades as one Id probably rank it only after the Kawahi trade. 7)  2012: James Harden trade to the Rockets: Nuff said. I don’t think OKC would have kept Harden after 2013. But they very well could have won the title that year. The fact Houston got Harden over someone else also matters a lot in the course of history. 8)  2014: Cavs trade Andrew Wiggins for Kevin Love: It’s too early to see how this will affect things. But Wiggins+LeBron+Kyrie long term likely is a much better option and I have a hard time believing that group from 2015-2019 wouldn’t be able to win a title. It would have been such a perfect fit. I don’t know if the Cavs as constructed now can win a title between now and 2019. 9)  2011: Chris Paul traded to the Clippers for ERic Gordon Unprotected 1st round pick Al Farouq Aminu: The Clippers became relevant all of a sudden again. Just as importantly, CP3 didn’t join the Lakers where if he had teamed up with Dwight Kobe and Pau probably would have resulted in a far better outlook than it was with Steve Nash. This trade potentially prevented another Lakers dynasty. 10) 2011: Nuggets trade Carmelo Anthony Chauncey Billups and Corey Brewer to the Knicks for Raymond Felton Danilo Gallinari Wilson Chandler Kousta Koufos Timofey Mosgov a first round pick in 2012 and rights to swap first round picks in 2016: In reality this trade wasn’t as consequential as we probably thought. If Melo doesn’t get traded here he signs with the Knicks or Nets in the offseason anyway and is stuck in the same mediocrity.

I always find it enjoyable when people (not just players on the dubs, but every player, as long as he's not playing against us) can knock down those long shots, and I would assume others feel the same. Then I started hearing about some people saying they find the 3pt shooting boring. It starts with Colin Cowherd. Now I find his argument completely bs, but I'm just using him as a starting point. Then I heard about Oscar Robertson's take on guarding Steph Curry Some say Oscar has never experienced or seen a player shooting like this, but I believe that game recognizes game, and if a HoFer talks like this, there must be a reason behind it. What is it? There were other reports about other older generation players don't see the current era of basketball ""real basketball"", whether it's due to rule change, players being soft, coaches being dumb, whatever.Recently there was another report about 3pt shooting makes basketball dull by Chicago Tribune. Most of these posts talk about how 3pt shooting would create a generation of shooters who just want to shoot because ""look at those NBA players! Everyone shoots! Point guards shoot! Power forwards are shooting 3s. Even centers sometimes take 3s! Why shouldn't I shoot?""So, I believe that a lot of you have watched basketball for a long time. Some of you even watched for over 20 years.

6564,"FUCK THE ROCKETS!

:D",1,"The 6th through 9th seeds in the Western Conference are all within a game and a half of each other, and tonight is of special importance since Portland and Dallas play each other tonight, as do Utah and Houston.Currently Portland is sitting in 6th, Dallas in 7th, Houston 8th, and Utah 9th, but all of that could change in a hurry.Here's some implications for each team if they win or lose:If Portland wins and Utah wins:Portland solidifies their spot in the 6th seed a bit more, giving them a 2 win cushion going into the last 10 games of the season. Dallas and Utah will be in a virtual tie for the 7th seed, making their third and final head-to-head game on April 11th all the more vital. Houston will move back to 9th.If Portland wins and Houston wins:Portland expands to a game lead on the other three, with Houston pulling into 7th, and Dallas in 8th, with Utah falling to a game out of the playoffs.If Dallas wins and Utah wins:Portland moves down to the 7th spot, with Dallas overtaking them. Utah moves into the playoffs at 8, and Houston moves down the 9th.If Dallas wins and Houston wins:Dallas moves into 6th, and the Blazers and Rockets will have the same record, be 2-2 in head-to-heads, and neither will win their division, so they will have to go to a third tie breaker (that I cannot find specification on) to determine seeding. Utah will have to start to go into panic mode as they will be at least two wins out of the playoffs.Last note: Dallas has a game left against Utah and a game against Houston.

After George Mikan, Bill Russell, and Wilt Chamberlain the next 20 to 30 years of talent (and the rules) seemed to really churn out great bigs to do battle on both ends of the paint. Right around the late 1960's and early 1970's the NBA was actually at the most densely packed of NBA Hall of Fame caliber centers that it ever was. Here's a thorough skill-by-skill breakdown I created of one of those great big men, Walt Bellamy:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMXF9QOd1BEBellamy was by most measures the 4th best center of the 1960's decade (in an 8-12 team league) behind Wilt Chamberlain, Bill Russell, and Nate Thurmond. In the 1970's as players like Willis Reed switched to center (he was Walt Bellamy's Power Forward on the Knicks in the 1960's!), and as Wes Unseld, Elvin Hayes (his first few seasons he played center), Bob Lanier, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, and Dave Cowens entered into the mix he was even lower down the list but still one of the better centers. Anyways I hope some of you enjoy seeing the center position being played in its hey-dey by one of the greats with a lot of rare footage.

Yeah Curry has a great team. But this team could win 25 or more games than that Lakers team. So there's a TONNE of room to work with.

The 3peat Lakers were a better supporting cast than this Warriors team and the 2009-2010 teams were just as good in terms of supporting cast. Yet these Warriors are still better than those teams (01 Lakers playoff pending).

You say it's all Curry's teammates (ridiculous, btw), yet Golden State gets outscored when Curry isn't on the floor. This is not the case when Draymond or Klay are off the floor.

6602,"Pardon the rant, but my friends and I discuss this topic all the time.


This is why it makes sense to evaluate players on a same era *relative* basis...so you can account for changes in rules etc.


And on relative basis, Curry is playing outrageously well on offense. All offensive juggernauts (KD, Melo etc.) have the same benefits re: no hand-checking. Yet Curry is shooting the 3-ball at unheard of efficiency/volume relative to peers.


Just like all players in Oscar's day benefited from 120+ possessions per game, but he is the only one who averaged a trip-doub.


Just like all players in MJ's era benefited from not playing against zone D (though Jordan crushed zone d's for a year in 2001-2002), but Jordan still consistently put up numbers far above peers.


The conversation gets silly when you cross eras, because there were so many other differences. In Oscar's day, for example, there were far fewer teams and fewer games. But there was also far inferior technology around training, supplements, diet, transportation (shitty buses), equipment, and things like air-conditioning. Players also had jobs on the side.


On the flip side, you could argue that the old generation had way less pressure. There was no internet, no social media. No 8-digit contracts and endorsement deals at risk. Every single box score was not updated live and tweeted. Games were on the radio and scores were in the paper the next day. Who knows how Oscar would have handled the media blitz that modern athletes face. Who knows if we'd all still love MJ if social media were all over some of his less desirable personality traits (gambler, cheater, generally an asshole), or if some scandal would have derailed him for a season, or in a particular playoff series.


And at a high level, one could argue that the NBA is by definition far more competitive than it used to be given the increase in money in the sport. How many great athletes didn't pursue NBA dreams with full intensity because it wasn't nearly as lucrative? How many more are training harder today because of the chance to make generational wealth in a few years, and/or attain international superstardom? What is the impact of having nationwide traveling teams, boosters, and AAU programs?


We love to debate ""who is the best"" across time, but it's a crapshoot. My friends and I love thinking about Wilt: if Wilt had all of the resources of a modern day athlete, he would probably be the greatest force ever seen on a basketball court. A bigger, stronger, more athletic DeAndre with offensive skill. He'd probably have stat streaks that make Curry mania seem mild. But how would he fare in the era of social media, money, fame, and other distractions? The access to women alone might have killed him. The man was known to get distracted in an era with far less glamour, after all.




TLDR: It's a crapshoot. Old people are salty. Young people have no respect. Enjoy the game.",17,"Hi all, I've only gotten into basketball for the past half decade or so, so I've never watched the old stuff.

We get to the game and I couldn't believe where the seats were.http://i.imgur.com/TWkCC8R.jpgI had to close the proshop that evening so I left straight from the course to the game. Game goes on, half time rolls around and Chris Paul comes up and starts talking to Andre Johnson, and we were right behind him.

We chatted for a few minutes before he left to go warm up for the second half.http://i.imgur.com/peXSGvf.jpgGame ends, and we are getting ready to leave. I heard someone yell ""hey"" and I don't know why I turned around but I did and coach Mike Woodson was there. He said that Chris had mentioned to him I was an assistant at Westwood, and he asked if there were any tee times the next morning. I told him the course is usually dead during the week. He said okay cool, and left and I didn't think much of it. Well the next morning I had to open to shop at 6:30 and we get a call and sure enough it was Mr. Woodson. He was wondering if he said he could set up a tee time for Coach Rivers, himself, and Coach Cassell. I told him absolutely, and again figured they would come out, play, and leave. They get there and since they had three they asked if I was available or one of the other pro's were available to join them. I lied and said I was the only one (who could pass up that opportunity.) So I grabbed my sticks and went out and played 18 holes with them, and it was an unforgettable experience.

We go ahead and exchange numbers before they left and call it a day. Sadly because I was at work and out playing golf it totally skipped my mind to ask for a picture with them on 18, and after they left I turned to one of the other assistants and said, ""How the f**k does one forget to ask for a picture with those guys around?"" He laughed and called me a dumbass. Regardless, this was such an awesome opportunity to have and I enjoyed every second of it, and am now looking forward to Coaches tournament in the summer.Edit: Going to check the pro shop security camera to see if there is a candid shot of us headed to the first tee or anything!",http://reddit.com/r/nba/comments/4b1kbd/c/d15wlwz,1458413177,nba,Played golf with the Clippers Coaching Staff yesterday.,745,4b1kbd,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/4b1kbd,1458345600

6660,"The main thing I've seen from the Clippers defense this year is that they've been playing a more conservative defense scheme and been better at sticking to their assignments. The first two Doc years, we were hedging hard on the high screen and rolls to take advantage of DJ/Blake's speed (similar to Miami used to do with the Big 3 but less extreme) but they'd occasionally have problems communicating on the backline and rotations leading to some open shots and average overall defense.

This year, DJ has been staying back more and they're giving up fewer wide open looks when the ball gets moved around. I'd say of the perimeter defenders, CP3/Austin/Luc are well above average on ball defenders, and most of the rest are average or worse on ball (in the case of Jamal and Pierce, way below average) but they've been pretty good at not blowing assignments (except you Jeff Green I see you please get better). On top of that, DJ has become a steadier post and at the rim defender every year even if he's not quite KG-elite at that, and Aldrich is a nice off the bench sub for giving steady paint defense as well, especially compared to the last few years.

My two cents from seeing most Clipper games...",15,"Ok, so the Clippers have been an elite offensive team for the last 5 years, but their defense has been up-and-down. Last year in what was perhaps their best offensive season of the Blake-Paul regime, they had an average defense which propelled two of their players to All-Defensive teams. Whether or not they deserved those honors is beside the point as both are at least good defensive players. The other three starters for most of the season were Blake, Reddick, and Barnes. I've never been too hot on Blake's defense, but others say it's good. Reddick has poor physical tools, but he is no slouch and gives great effort. Barnes was a good defender in most situations. Obviously the bench consisting of Big Baby, Jamal, Hedo, Austin, Hawes, etc. was very bad on defense, but considering that the starters play a majority of the minutes and Doc is decent at staggering lineups, it's hard to see how their defense would be straight average when they start 5 at least good defenders. And then there's this year. Barnes is gone, Paul and Reddick are older, Blake's been out for like 40 (?) games, and the bench arguably got worse. AND YET, they are tied for the 6th best defense. How? How were they average last year with a purportedly great starting five? And how are they borderline top 5 this year with worse defensive players getting serious playing time?   inb4 (great starting 5 + terrible bench)/2 = average defense",http://reddit.com/r/nba/comments/4aj8te/c/d10sexf,1458060876,nba,ELI5: the Clippers defense?,7,4aj8te,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/4aj8te,1458000000

I think that will happen if Kyrie and Love prove they can carry the mail in big games. ",1,"Maybe the real ""problem"" with the Cavs isn't Kevin Love ""fitting in instead of fitting out"" or Kyrie Irving being ""unhappy and wanting out of Cleveland,"" but rather LeBron's (low-key) quest to catch/pass Kareem on the all-time scoring list. Perhaps the way the Cavs win is by LeBron switching from a primary scorer to THE primary facilitator. What if LeBron became more like Magic and less like MJ? If you think about it it makes a ton of sense:1.) With LeBron focused primarily on playmaking on the offensive end, Kyrie could move over to the role of primary scorer (adjusting to his strengths and allowing him to compete for scoring titles) and Love could shift over to the role of the secondary option (he's been, by far, at his best in Cleveland in that role).2.) LeBron is an ELITE passer and has the ability to lead the NBA in assists, while still putting up points as a third scorer (see Love's current rate of ~17-18pnts) and allowing him to still get his All Star, All NBA, MVP love. (He's always said he was more like/been most favorably compared to Magic.)3.) LeBron could focus more energy on D which, while no longer his strongest attribute, he remains more than capable playing D at a high level -- and he's still one of the most versatile defenders in the entire NBA. Plus, given that D is weakest area for both Love and Kyrie, more effort from LeBron could help get the Cavs back to their top 5 defensive from earlier this season.4.) Such a move would address the elephant in the room: LeBron is nearing the end of his prime and the incredible stress he's put on his body/continues to put on his body -- with the number of minutes he plays and, importantly, his style of play -- is catching up to him. Exerting less energy on the offensive end could prolong his career on the back end.5.) Even if LeBron doesn't ultimately catch Kareem (or MJ or Malone or Kobe) in scoring, he'd still get close. And neither MJ nor Kobe ever led the league in assists (or averaged double-digit assists, for that matter). And Magic never won a scoring title (which LeBron already did). In other words, his argument for GOAT would be as strong (arguably stronger) -- especially if the Cavs were to win 2-3 chips).Still don't think it makes sense? Go back and look at Magic's great Lakers teams of the 80's/early 90's. By way of examples: Magic was the #3/#4 scoring option on the '80 (18pnts) and '82 (18.6pnts) championship teams, and the #2/#3 scoring option on the '88 (19.6pnts) championship team. Because of his assists/playmaking, however, he still got All Star, All NBA, MVP, and Finals MVP love in some/all of those seasons. LeBron could easily average 18pnts (in his sleep) and, with all the offensive firepower at his disposal, could very likely lead the NBA in assists as well. Throw in improved D and he'd still be at/near the top of the MVP conversation while remaining a shoe-in for All Star and All NBA. Plus, like Magic, he could turn it on in the playoffs and during the Finals (as needed).Fun Fact(s): Magic won the last of his 5 chips in 1988. Byron Scott led that Lakers in scoring during the regular season (~22pnts) and James Worthy led that Lakers team in scoring during the playoffs (~21pnts). Magic still dropped ~20pnts and ~12assts a game that season, was an All Star and First Team All NBA, and almost won MVP (he finished 3rd) and Finals MVP (he, arguably, should have won).http://www.basketball-reference.com/teams/LAL/1988.html",http://reddit.com/r/nba/comments/48iz6v/c/d0jzdcl,1456873857,nba,LeBron needs to play more like Magic and less like MJ in order for the Cavs to win a Championship,0,48iz6v,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/48iz6v,1456790400

Only way that this would happen is having a superstar on a terrible team, where the coach doesn't care. AKA James Harden if he was on Philly)Wilt's 100 point game (Nope, hell no, never. Curry and Durant are the only 2 who would come close now, but I can't see them eclipsing 75, 80 would be nearly impossible for either, and I doubt someone would be able to play for pretty much 48 minutes and score a basket every minute)Chicago's 72 win season (About to get broken by GSW, even if they don't, just need a super team with a weak conference, why GSW can do it this year)Skiles 30 assist game (This too sounds nearly impossible as pointguards are deviating from playmaking like this, and when they do [Rondo] they are criticized for it bc they are chasing stats)Rasheed's 41 technicals (With the NBA and teams caring so much about public image now, they would not allow this. There would be some sort of long term suspension by the time they reach 35. Only way is if 3 seconds in the key was somehow considered a technical [I know its not] and then you get Eddy Curry to sit in the paint for a couple of games)Calderon's 98.1 free throw percentage (This is incredible too as the better shooters in the league will most likely never reach this since Calderon only took 154 FT's so he only needed to make 151, and for someon like Curry takes over double, and with that many, there is much larger deviation, so even though Curry is a better shooter, his best is only 93.4%)Tell me what you think",http://reddit.com/r/nba/comments/4cbbpd/c/d1hrllu,1459265635,nba,"Bill Simmons's Unbreakable Records, and will they be broken?",467,4cbbpd,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/4cbbpd,1459123200

Budgeting 6 fouls for 4 quarters is tough enough without having to worry about multiple overtime periods. To fix this, I propose every player be allowed only 2 fouls in all combined OT periods. That way you must still be mindful of your fouls, but you won't immediately be tossed for your first. This reduces the effects of poor calls in regulation and also puts everyone on equal ground if a player comes in with no or few prior fouls (who might consider hacking when a poor FT shooter has the ball).

When Karl got here, he wanted Cousins traded. That's why you had him saying all the players are expandable. Cuz demanded a trade because he didn't want to play for a coach who didn't even want him there. 

Karl was actively trying to trade him for Lawson+Faired+??? Why else on earth would Ty say he's going to Sacramento after Denver drafted Mudiay? Pretty sure he knew Karl was targeting him. 

Karl started beef with Cousins because Cousins didn't fit his fast paced offense. 

Your information is the other way around. I'm not excusing Cousins for his actions, but you act like Karl is the victim. 1. Karl wanted Cousins gone. 2. Karl TOLD THE MEDIA HE WANTED COUSINS GONE implicitly. Who started what again?

",2,"Under the current rules, if the game is tied at the end of the period, the players continue to play overtime periods until the game is decided. My idea: if the game is still tied after the first overtime, then each team will select five players who will then play one-on-one with the other team's players (similar in concept to the sudden death shoot-outs in other games). Rules: Use a coin-toss (or whoever won the first tip-off) to decide who gets posession of the ball first (call the winner team A, and the other team B). Team A sends out one of its five players to play offense, and in response, team B can select its defender based on who team A chooses. However, each player can only be selected to play offense or defense once during the shoot-out (unless both teams are tied after all five players play, I'll get to that later). The two players then go one-on-one against each other. Assume both teams are in the bonus, and each two counts for two, and three counts for three (I was considering a 1-2 scoring system, but think that would give three-point shooters too much of an edge). After the first game, alternate the order so that team B selects a player for offense, and team A selects their player for defense. After the five games are played (and each player has played once on offense and defense), if the game is still tied, then proceed to sudden death. Without knowing who the other team selects, each team selects one player who will play offense and defense in a series of one-on-ones until the game is decided. Example: if player A gets first posession and scores two points, player B must score two points as well to tie (alternatively, he can go for a 3 to win the game), otherwise team B loses. However, if player A misses, and player B scores anything then team B wins. After each tie, alternate which player goes first on offense, and then continue until a winner is decided.This idea came about after talking with a friend. Now, I know it will never happen, but I think it would be tons of fun if they ever implemented it. Most of the fans would love to see the star basketball players go one-on-one against each other, but there's no incentive for the stars to risk their reputation like that. With this system, the players will need to give it their all since the game is on the line, and it would be extremely exciting given its rarity (not sure how often double overtimes occur,  but its definitely infrequent).

Now this is far too harsh of a response from the refs, but draymond did the same thing. Ok. That's understandable, guys don't usually get T'd up for that. In the third quarter, he missed a free throw and hits the ball at the ref so hard it almost smacks him in the face. Not sure why he gets away with this, but maybe the ref didn't think it was intentional or egregious. A little later, he gets called for a foul trying to run through a Steven Adams' pick like he's Von Miller. Common foul, no issue with that. He proceeds to get in the refs face while repeating ""how is that a foul on me?"". The ref turns to walk away, and draymond just follows him.What I'm really asking is how many other guys could get away with all of this stuff?Edit: So this post has devolved into a lot of shit talking.

7109,always like Ed Davis since he was with the Raptors. hope he gets some good run/minutes in the future,2,"Edit: Behind. I was sitting behind the basket reddit. Super late post, but I just got a chance to upload some pics from the game. So I'm a lifelong Blazers fan and Portland area native that's lived in Dallas for the last decade plus. I try to make it to every game the Blazers play in Dallas, and with a few exceptions I've made it to most of them in the last 10 years. Yesterday the wifey and I scored some seats 5 rows back from the court near the basket and near the visitors Bench. I got lucky and saw someone on StubHub had wayyyy under priced their seats so I snagged them a couple hours before tipoff. I've included some (blurry) pics in an album that I've linked to below, but I thought I'd give some quick notes from the game. The NBA game is completely different when you're up that close so I'd like to give some details I noticed. -When he's not actually playing in the game, Dirk walks like an 86 year old that just got in a car accident. Then the clock starts and he drops 40 on us. WTF?? -Deron Williams is a bruising guy. A lot stockier in person than I thought. The Blazers guards were helpless against his strength. When Lillard was on him, D Will's eyes lit up and he just dropped that burly shoulder into Dame's chest and pushed him back 3-4 steps every time. Like Dirk, he just couldn't miss from outside. The Blazers desperately need some physical perimeter defenders. -Mason Plumlee is incredibly athletic around the basket, but it doesn't translate into great interior defense. When you see his arm length and jumping ability up close, you would think he'd get more blocks than he does. -After the starting lineups were introduced, I didn't notice Noah Vonleh at all. Wait I think he inbounded in front of us a couple times. -Wes Matthews is a talker. He probably should have been T'd up after a foul call in the first half, but the ref heard him out. A while later the ref called the ball out of bounds right in front of us and before the ref had even finished pointing in the Blazers direction, Wes was talking. ""Oh that's a bad call!!"". He turned and kept talking to the ref and I couldn't hear what was being said, but the ref was cracking up. What ever Wes is saying, is fairly personable I guess!-Damian Lillard is very tuned in to his guys. In the first half Crabbe screwed up on offense (turnover maybe? can't remember), and Stotts yanked him. Dame saw AC walking back to the bench with his head down and ran over to give him a fist bump. Crabbe came back in later and tore it up. Awesome to see that leadership. -Ed Davis has an incredibly quick jump. I mean it's the NBA, all the guys have a quick jump, but Davis is all fast twitch muscle. Even if he's not grabbing the rebound himself, he's in the mix. Very physical. I lost count of how many times he either got Mavs defenders out of position for a rebound, or at least was able to get a finger on it and tap it out to a teammate to maintain possession. -Stotts has a pretty commanding voice. I could hear him yell for the subs even when he was standing midcourt down by the scorers table. I could hear the play calls he was yelling. -The first F bomb award of the game goes to Dirk. About 2 minutes into the game there was a loose ball foul called underneath Portland's basket, and Dirk let off about 4-5 ""Fucks!!"" in a row right in front of us. So awesome to see a HOF that fiery right off the jump. He wants to win so badly. Celebrities or sports figures in attendance: Icecube was sitting courtside. Think he was promoting a movie.  Paul Allen(Blazers & Seahawks owner) and Jason Witten, Dallas Cowboys Tight End were both there and were talking before the game. Witten to Seahawks confirmed!All in all, a very fun game to watch in person. Congrats to the Mavs and Dirk who just couldn't fucking miss all game.

McClendon is accused of ""colluded with another oil and natural gas company over a five year period to avoid bidding against each other for leases in Oklahoma, with the pre-determined winner allocating part of the lease to the “loser.”If convicted, will the other owners of OKC distance themselves or punish McClendon? He supposedly has as recently as 2014, purchased additional shares of the team from other co-owner, Jefferey Records Jr. If the NBA chooses to discipline McClendon, it wouldn't be the first time. The NBA fined McClendon $250,000 in response to statements he made to the press shortly after they moved the Seattle SuperSonics to Oklahoma City, as his statements contradicted the organization's publicized intentions at the time. McClendon disclosed to the OKC Journal Record that the team had planned to move the team all along, despite their public stance that they'd wanted to keep the team in Seattle.
Here are McClendon's comments that resulted in a $250,000 fine:“We didn’t buy the team to keep it in Seattle, we hoped to come here. We know it’s a little more difficult financially here in Oklahoma City, but we think it’s great for the community and if we could break even we’d be thrilled.”“We started to look around and at that time the Sonics were going through some ownership challenges in Seattle,” McClendon told the Journal Record. “So Clay, very artfully and skillfully, put himself in the middle of those discussions and to the great amazement and surprise to everyone in Seattle, some rednecks from Oklahoma, which we’ve been called, made off with the team.”SourceSourceUPDATE: Won't face jail time; died today in a car accident.

My question is, am I an asshole? Coming into watching the NBA I didn't know who to watch, I just knew the huge names like Lebron, KD, etc. The player who really got me into watching the NBA more often instead of just random highlights in montages on YouTube was Derrick Rose.  Over time I decided to watch the Bulls play every game, then Rose got injured and I figured I'd skip that nights game. So I guess I'm not really a Bulls fan, but a fan of Derrick Rose instead. I watch other teams like the Cavaliers, Thunder, Spurs, Warriors play most of their games because I want to watch the best play, and I'm a fan of watching big time teams play the Sport well. So I'm a fan of the Cavaliers as well. On top of this, I'm from San Diego. So I suppose I should be a Clippers or maybe a Lakers fan?

So here we go!Round 1I mean, what more needs to be said? a brain fart of tremendous proportions. Considering the rest of the names available, AI, as amazing as he was, can't be considered higher than a round 4/5 pick at best. Chuck tries his hardest to alleviate the problem with his next two picks but the damage is done.Kevin is of course setting a challenge for himself by only picking ex-Celtics players, and I like the pick of Larry Legend, but the fact he didn't take Bill Russell here always perplexes me. Still, it's a great first round pick and sets up Kevin nicely going forward.History repeats itself as MJ drops to number 3 in the draft. An absolute coup for Reggie and obviously the best possible pick anyone could have made. This looks like a good pick in isolation; Wilt is without a doubt one of the most dominant regular season players ever, and his numbers are just unparalleled. Something tells me that Chris might regret this decision later down the line...How better to explain why this is the second best pick of the round than to quote the man himself? ""Bill Russell won't distort your offence or your defence. The way I play, my team wins."" Love it.A great pick, there is absolutely no one left on the board who Kenny could have taken instead and I rate it as the third best pick of the round, behind Reggie and Steve. Fantastic work for the last pick of the round.Rankings after Round 1Round 2Kenny Smith selects Magic JohnsonLove, love, love this pick. Not only has Kenny managed to pick two of the best players ever to play the game, but also two players who played together and will have excellent chemistry. The perfect compliment for his first round pick and Kenny shoots up the rankings.Steve Kerr selects Scottie PippenListen. I love Scottie Pippen as much as the next man, but taking Scottie as a second rounder is a head scratcher. There are a lot of HUGE names left on the board, and while I like the pairing of Scottie and Bill Russell a LOT, I can't help but feel Steve could have picked up a better player and still got Scottie later on. Chris Webber selects Oscar RobertsonI like the Big O a lot, and he is certainly drafted in the right round, but pairing him with Wilt is a recipe for disaster. I just don't see a scenario where you pair one of the most selfish, me-centred players ever in Wilt with a noted grump like Oscar working out at all. If they managed to put their heads together then they would be a force to be reckoned with, but history tells us that they can't. A calming, team-first presence like Tim Duncan would have worked wonders here.Reggie Miller selects Hakeem OlajuwonA fantastic pick once again, having Hakeem as his starting centre is a brilliant choice which gives him another scoring option and a terrific inside presence to go along with Jordans perimeter D. Reggie still the man to beat.Kevin McHale selects Shaquille O'NealeI like this pick for Kevin, with Shaq on the inside and Larry on the outside, Kevin has incredible versatility in his offence and a strong defensive identity. Not bad at all.Charles Barkley selects Moses MaloneIn a shock twist, the chuckster actually makes a good pick! Chuck needed a dominant centre badly, because if you look at the other teams, they all have a top, top tier centre. So Chuck gets his HOF centre, but is still playing catch up with the rest of the crew.Rankings after Round 2ReggieKennyKevinSteveChrisChuckRound 3Charles Barkley selects Tim DuncanYES, CHUCK. Chuck somehow manages to take one of the greatest players of all time to open up the third round. Timmy could realistically have been picked in the first round, so this is a real coup. I love this pick so much and If Chuck can build on this with smart picks for the rest of the draft, he could be in a great position.Kevin McHale selects Kevin GarnettFantastic. I LOVE the pairing of KG and Shaq up top, they would be the most intimidating front court ever, and with a sniper like Larry on the wings, I am absolutely crazy about this team so far. What a pick.Reggie Miller selects John StocktonReggie is on fire. With two players like Hakeem and MJ who are going to be taking a lot of shots, Reggie needed a player who was going to get them the ball and be the ultimate team mate. Inspired.Chris Webber selects Isiah Thomas""I'm gonna move Oscar to the two guard and let Stockton worry about Isiah""...EH???? Isiah is one of my favourite players ever, and I think he'd be a great choice for any of the other teams in this round, but I HATE him in this team. Not only is Oscar gonna be pissed as all hell that he's got to share the ball handling with Isiah, but this team has NO outside shooting. This is moving in to hot mess territory....Steve Kerr selects Kobe BryantLOVE IT. The biggest hole Steve's team had was that it had no go-to scorer, and short of getting MJ Steve got the best scorer available. Furthermore, Kobe's team-driven, unselfish team mates are going to be prefect facilitators. Kenny Smith selects Julius ErvingIn the words of The Jet: ""We scoring, baby!"" Kenny's team is looking absolutely fearsome on the offensive end, and the thought of a Magic/Dr. J fast break pretty much puts me at full mast. Questions are to be asked of the perimeter D, though.Rankings after Round 3Round 4Kenny Smith selects Jerry WestI like it! The Logo was 4 time First Team All Defense, a former scoring champ and assists leader. So Kenny gets his perimeter D and hasn't messed anything up, chemistry wise. Kenny has picked up an absolute steal in the 4th round and he shoots up the rankings once more.Steve Kerr selects Lebron JamesMULTIPLE FIRE EMOJIS. This more than makes up for taking Scottie in the second round. Steve gets the ball handler he needed, he gets more versatile, keeps the defensive identity and JUST LOOK HOW FREAKING ATHLETIC THIS TEAM IS. I am in love.Chris Webber selects Dominique WilkinsWelcome to Chris Webber's ""All-Moody-Ballhog Fantasy Draft!"" Sweet Jesus. This team would run through 8 coaches a season. Poor Isiah.Reggie Miller selects David RobinsonUpon this selection, Reggie says that he will ""move Hakeem to the power forward position, his true position."" Hmmmm. I'm not convinced. Not that The Admiral isn't a great player, but I think Reggie should have gone for a traditional PF here as there are still a couple of big names on the board who really would have improved his team without dragging Hakeem away from the basket. Disappointing considering the huge leaps made by Steve and Kenny this round.Kevin McHale selects John HavlicekI feel like Kevin really needs a primary ball handler at this point, but his self-imposed restrictions are hurting him. Hondo is a good choice, but with Bird already on the team and such a gaping hole at point guard, I think The Glove would've made this team scary as all hell.Charles Barkley selects Reggie MillerAs they say, you can never have too much scoring, but I don't like this pick for Chuck. He needs a distributor to get the ball to AI and inside to Dunc & Moses. Reggie is going to be demanding the ball a lot and there just aren't enough minutes to give both AI and Reggie. GP or Chuck himself would have been good choices here, I feel.Rankings after Round 4Round 5Charles Barkley selects James WorthyCharles needed a SF and Big Game James is a solid, if uninspiring choice. With Sir Charles himself still on the board its strange he wouldn't take himself with either of these last two picks.Kevin McHale selects Bob CousySo Kevin gets his ball handler, but i'm just not sure about this one. Cousy is an all time great for sure, and playing with Sam Jones and Bill Russell shows he knows how to get the ball out to the wing and in to the paint,  but his lack of a reliable jump shot and lax defence worry me slightly. Reggie Miller selects Charles BarkleyBack on track. I like this pick for Reggie a lot as it fills the hole at SF and also gives another PF option if he wanted to go a bit smaller and quicker. With Barkley, Jordan and Robinson on the team, they look tough as all hell.Chris Webber selects Kevin McHaleChris needed a PF and he got one of the best ever. But holy crap, the chemistry of this team is all out of whack. So now not only do you have Oscar and Isiah fighting for the ball in the back court, Nique wanting to get his 30 shots off on the wing, but you've got Wilt and Kevin up top dribbling the ball in the post for 22 seconds a possession. Good lord.Steve Kerr selects Karl MaloneA good pick. Steve, like Chris, was crying out for a PF and got his man. This team is just too athletic for words. If he can get hold of a point guard he's all set.Kenny Smith selects Clyde DrexlerOh, I hate this pick. Hate it. Kenny has scorers coming out of his ears, so i dont get this pick at all. Kobe, MJ, Larry, Scottie would shut. him. down.Rankings after Round 5Round 6Kenny Smith selects Gary PaytonI love it. Defense, playmaking, intensity, toughness, he has everything Kenny needs right now. Magic can play minutes at PF for sure, but I definitely feel Kenny needs to get one on his team before its too late...Steve Kerr selects Steve NashSteve absolutely smashes it out of the park with this one. He needs someone who can move the ball and keep the offense flowing while being able to hit shots himself when Kobe is off the floor or running cold. 10/10.Chris Webber selects Patrick EwingFunnily enough, I don't hate this one. Ewing is unselfish enough to really give them some help off the bench, and finally Isiah has a partner who can back him up and try and keep the other head-cases in check. Reggie Miller selects Ray AllenWith his first team all set, Reggie can start focusing on his bench, and I think Jesus Shuttlesworth is a perfect selection for his spot up shooting dearth. This team looks unstoppable!Kevin McHale selects Sam JonesI like the addition of Jones at SG, a 10x champion and a lethal shooter. I just worry that the other teams have got such dominant shooting guard talents (MJ, Kobe, West, AI) that Sam Jones might struggle. Kevin is starting to feel the pinch, Ray Allen would have been a great selection for him here.Charles Barkley selects Jerry LucasCapable back up for Timmy, but this point guard situation is getting out of hand, theres some big names still on the board and Charles is going to miss out if he's not careful.Rankings after Round 61.Reggie2.Steve3.Kenny4.Kevin5.Charles6.ChrisRound 7Charles selects Dave CowensSimilarly to his previous pick, Cowens is fine as back up for Moses but with 10 more picks until his next go, Charles is going to find getting a capable point guard incredibly difficult.Kevin McHale selects Tiny ArchibaldI think this is a good pick for Kevin, and i trust Tiny to do more against modern point guards than Cousy, but there are undeniably better PGS available, unfortunately for Kevin they never wore green!Reggie Miller selects Jason KiddCase in point. Kidd would have been a great selection for Kevin, but Reggie manages to pick up the pieces once again. Reggie's team going from strength to strength, but I still have questions about that front court pairing. When are we getting some cover at PF, Reggie?Chris Webber selects Alex EnglishI really, really like this pick. With such explosive and dominant personalities on the team already, Webber needs low-key, consistent scoring, and theres nobody better at that than the quiet, underrated former Gamecock.Steve Kerr selects Dwight HowardThis was 2011 after all. Dwight might raise a few eyebrows now, but i think he is a solid back up for Russell in this team and gives Steves team some more much needed rim protection.Kenny Smith selects Connie HawkinsKenny, Kenny, Kenny. I WARNED YOU. When you wait this long to choose a power forward this is what happens! Oh, I'd buy tickets to the game for sure, but the idea of The Hawk going up against someone like Kevin McHale or Karl Malone makes me nervous just thinking about it.Rankings after round 7Round 8Kenny Smith selects Elvin HayesUNDERRATED PICK ALERT. The Big E was one hell of a player, and I like him way more than Connie Hawkins for that PF position. Look up Elvin Hayes if you can!Steve Kerr selects Dirk NowitzkiWHAT A PICK! Dirk coming off the bench for this team would be a spacing nightmare for their opponents. With a front court rotation of Russell/Howard and Malone/Nowitzki and a back court of Nash, Kobe and Pippen, Steve has got one hell of a team.Chris Webber selects Chris MullinChris is doing his best to sort out this teams chemistry and outside shooting problems, and I think this is a good pick. Keep it going, Chris. A couple more like this and you might be on to something.Reggie Miller selects Alonzo MourningReggie, what if this Hakeem-at-PF experiment doesn't work? what are you going to do? I like Zo, but you're in danger of losing ground here if you don't pick up a PF sharpish.Kevin McHale selects Robert ParishParish is a great choice as a back up for Shaq daddy, his mobility will be a blessing against the other quick bigs on the other teams. Solid pick.Charles Barkley selects Deron WilliamsNO REALLY. CHECK THE VIDEO HE ACTUALLY DID.""And for my 9th pick, i select Andray Blatche!""Good lord.Rankings after round 8Round 9Charles Barkley selects Kevin DurantYou lucky fucker. This pick makes not much sense in 2011 but history has redeemed you, Sir Charles.Kevin McHale selects Paul PierceAnd Raptors fans shudder! Great pick by Kevin here, who has created quite a formidable team exclusively from ex-Celtics, which is super impressive.Reggie Miller selects Dwyane WadeYeah, yeah, I get it, back up for Jordan without losing anything, sure. But we all know MJ is playing 40 minutes at least so this is meaningless. If this last pick of his isn't a power forward I'm going to scream.Chris Webber selects George GervinAlright Chris, come on now, it's getting a bit overkill with the scoring now. Still, You can't go wrong with a 4x scoring champ. If we can put an end to that horrible Isiah/Oscar backcourt idea you had we might have the semblances of an actual team.Steve Kerr selects Dennis JohnsonSolid back up for Nash and Kobe in the backcourt, this team will be able to swing the ball around like its nobodys business.Kenny Smith selects Elgin BaylorSteal of the show!Elgin Baylor, who is without doubt one of the top 20 players of all time, falls to the 9th round and is snapped up by Kenny who was in desperate need of some more forwards. What a pick!Rankings after round 9SteveKennyReggieKevinChrisCharlesRound 10Kenny Smith selects Kenny SmithGod damn it Kenny, all you had to do was pick someone semi decent and you could have consolidated second place. You did this to yourself.Steve Kerr selects Grant HillAt least Steve is still taking it seriously, his first place position is safe, surely!Chris Webber selects Chris WebberThis team is super weird, and im not sure if its in a good way. Everything is there, you've got point guards and scorers, youve got rim protectors and rebounding, but the chemistry balance just seems way off. Still, I can't possibly rank this team below a team with Deron Williams starting at PG.Reggie Miller selects Steve KerrAAAAAAAAAAAAARRRRRRRRRRRRGHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHKevin McHale selects Tommy HeinsohnAnother solid pick, but i cant help but feel its a bit top heavy, i'm not jumping up and down about a backcourt of Cousy/Archibald and Sam Jones.Charles Barkley selects Bob LanierNot for me. Chuck already had cover at Centre and was in desperate need of another PG. Not a fan.Here they are in full:I've made my thoughts clear throughout.

In the NBA thanks to a variety of things - much more binding contracts, salary caps making transfer fees almost non-factors, the draft lottery as a safety cushion for bad teams compared to the relegation pressure on bad football teams etc., you have a much more variable top-flight and much less ability to buy your way into contention - even the Cavs only managed it because they managed to lure back one of the greatest players of this generation *and* got stupid lucky with the draft",3,,http://reddit.com/r/nba/comments/4bhrz6/c/d19han4,1458673199,nba,"[Yahoo] Scalabrine says superstars are underpaid, suggests allowing each team 1 'super-max' contract",413,4bhrz6,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/4bhrz6,1458604800

7310,Did not know it was for the onion lol thought it was a serious article!,1,"Though he single handedly murdered the Trailblazers last night, some may still be debating whether or not J.J. Redick should be a hall of famer. As a painfully biased J.J. fan, the choice is obvious, but to make the decision easier for you, I have hand-picked stats a la ESPN to make J.J. Redick look like what he truly is: the greatest player of all time.When it comes to discussions of who is the GOAT, two names are said most often: Michael Jordan and J.J. Redick. Though most would lean towards selecting MJ in this case, consider this fact: J.J. Redick’s teams have a 6-3 record when he shoots 100% from the field. Michael Jordan? 0-0. 
Jordan has not once shot 100% from the field, while Redick has done it 9 times. If that doesn’t make the case clear enough, how about this:J.J. Redick is the only player with 33 points, 7 3PM, 3 rebounds, 5 assists, 2 steals, and 1 turnover in under 32 minutes. Unprecedented. Many people are making the claim this season that Steph Curry is the greatest shooter of all time. That’s interesting, because J.J. Redick is the only player to score at least 40 points, while shooting 75% from 3 and 100% from the free throw line. Maybe Steph should hit the gym. Speaking of shooting perfect free throws, J.J. Redick has more career games in which he made all of his free throws (279) than Stephen Curry (261) and Kevin Durant (255). Thundersticks do not intimidate J.J. Redick.Many of the greats are praised for their ability to take their game to the next level on the road. Well J.J. is no different, as he is the last starter to score at least 26 points, make 5 threes, and record only 1 foul on 90% shooting on the road since Reggie Miller. No, I am not kidding you. Some NBA fans will agree that J.J. Redick is a great scorer, but cannot lead an offense like someone such as LeBron. Well these casuals better do their homework, because there are only two current NBA players to score at least 30 pts, on 90% 2pt shooting, with 8 FTA: J.J. Redick and LeBron James.Case closed. Doc Rivers should stop referring to the Clippers as having a “Big Three,” and instead should recognize he has an Enormous One.(This was part of an article I wrote for ChodeLeage.com.

7381,"&gt;and now we have Vujacic starting and Jerian Grant on the bench playing 3 mins.

Vujacic is getting starting nods once in a while because no other player on the Knicks roster knows the triangle and can make reads within it at the same level he does, and of course because Afflalo is recovering from injury. Grant also plays more minutes than him.

&gt;And we could've resigned Larkin, but $1 million was apparently way too expensive for a sophomore

So you could have another player to complain about not getting enough minutes? Grant and Galloway is enough young guard talent, after that you need veterans to help develop them. 

&gt;And let's not forget trading Tyson for Jose, who is untradeable and is still on contract for next season.

Tyson, an injury-prone player on an expiring contract, coming off an awful season both health and performance-wise, was traded for a starting PG, a solid backup C, two draft picks, and the opportunity to part with a bad contract in Felton. Chandler then proceeded to leave the team he was traded to for nothing, just like he would have done to the Knicks.

Especially early this season, it became kind of a basketball hipster argument to say Whiteside isn't even a good defender and he's overrated, which is just ridiculous if you watch him on a regular basis.

The reason they were ""better"" with him defensively off the court was because they staggered the minutes so Bosh would play with Winslow (their best perimeter defender) at the start of the 2nd and 4th quarters against backups and they would smother them.

Turner has played about 22 minutes per game while Jokic has played about 20 minutes per game. So as you can see they're pretty comparable when it comes to minutes.  However then we look at the the stats, if PER, TS%, and BPM (or any other advance stat really) mean anything to you it's not even close who's the better player. Jokic has a PER of 21.8 compared to Turners 16.1, Jokic has a TS% of 59% compared to Turners 54%, Jokic has a BPM of 4.7 compared to Turners -2.5.  If you're not about those advanced stats; per game Jokic averages more rebounds, assists, and steals. Per 36 he averages more everything except blocks.

7457,That isn't your basketball. That was what basketball used to be. Calling the NBA soft comparatively is just factually true. ,2,"I've been watching NBA games consistently for over a decade, and for a long time I've had this lingering belief that the quality of today's players are better than it's ever been. When I hear old-timers like Oscar Robertson dismiss today's players as ""soft"" and ""not understanding the game"".....I'm forced to actually go back and do research on how these old-school players played the game. And I have no doubt in my mind that the quality of today's NBA players is much much higher than it was in any time in history. Today's players can shoot better, pass better, dribble much better, are far more athletic, play offensive and defensive schemes which would leave any 1980's player absolutely flummoxed, and they play far better defense. With the advancement of zone defense, you now have multiple weak side defenders rotating to fill any gaps that exist between the player with the ball and the hoop, making it MUCH harder to score in today's league. Hence why NBA scoring levels are much lower today than the 1980's. Nowadays in today's NBA, you're considered an offensive liability if you can't shoot the 3-Pointer. Nowadays, you have stretch 4's and even stretch 5's who can not only aggressively rotate in guarding perimeter players, but are expected to have relatively deep range as well as being a low-post threat. Now I'm not disrespecting players like Moses Malone or Magic Johnson or any of these Hall-of-Famers. I'm just stating that there's no way that a player from that era would be as effective today as he was back then. We need to speak the blunt truth and look at the overall quality of today's offense and defense. And for those who think otherwise, I recommend that you search for 1980's NBA Finals games on YouTube. I just recently watched every game of the 1984 and 1987 NBA Finals (Bird vs Magic)....and I compared the quality of their play to the NBA of today. It isn't even close. Watch every single minute of every game of those series, the so-called ""golden era of NBA Basketball"" and the talent level does not scratch the surface of today's elite players. Ignore the hard fouls and the trash-talking and the near fights. Look at the actual gameplay and the difference is like night and day. Today's players have the benefit of advanced training, physical therapy, better nutrition, better coaching, and far better competition. And with the influx of International NBA stars, especially from Europe, you're going to have an overall much higher level of competition. Michael Jordan was being guarded by the likes of Craig Ehlo. Ehlo wouldn't even be able to start in today's league. And this is no disrespect to him, but we should acknowledge that comparing players across different eras is a futile exercise. I don't see any serious person arguing that a player like George Mikan or Bob Cousy could thrive in today's league. So why is the exception being made for 1980's NBA players? How could anyone not look at a player like LeBron James and not objectively conclude that he was far more talented (when it comes to pure skill) than the elite players of that era? Now obviously there are players who could transcend any era (ie. Jordan, Bird, Magic, Olajuwon, etc.), but if we are going to make comparisons between contemporary NBA players and players of the past, then we should at least put them in their context. If LeBron James or Russell Westbrook were put in a time machine and sent back to 1985, then they would be even MORE dominant than they are today. And I just can't see how this isn't obvious to more people.TODAY is the golden era of NBA Basketball. Be objective, and don't be misguided by your nostalgia.P.S. And to those people who will inevitably say ""Today's NBA is soft, LeBron could be manhandled by those Bad Boy Pistons"".....you have to acknowledge the fact that LeBron is far stronger and more imposing than any ""Bad Boy Piston"" and could hold his own in a physical match-up against any of them. But this is basketball, and I'm not buying tickets to watch NBA players beat each other up in the paint. That isn't good defense, that's not good basketball, and it just further proves my point that this era is far superior to any other era of basketball. And I'm not even saying this as a LeBron fan. I don't even like the guy, my favorite player has always been Tim Duncan, but I'm acknowledging talent when I see it.

7479,"Cause they'll get twice less money from tickets, TV and everything. Think about it before writhing a shit ton of text.",-1,"Just like all of us on here, I want to see some entertaining basketball, especially in the post-season and, although there were some entertaining series in last year playoffs, most of the series played were just okay. For example look at the first round. The only good series was Spurs v Clippers, which is considered one of the best series of all time, but other than that it resulted in 3 sweeps, 2 series where the losing team wins one game, and 2 series were the losing team wins two games. Other than Spurs v Clippers, there were only 3 other good series (in my opinion).  If the NBA adapts the top 16 teams format, there could have been at least 6 or MORE series ranging from entertaining to amazing. (Again, this is just my opinion).There are a few reasons that people point out on why it would not work, but if you actually think about it, they are not very significant. 
One of the biggest cons to the top 16 team format is with the time zones differences as it would be hard to schedule games where teams are three hours away, but this problem will only occur when Pacific Time Zone teams play Eastern Time Zone team (matches between the other time zones matches can happen in the current format). If we look at last year, where the top 16 teams were able to go to the playoffs, there would only be one significant time zone difference, which would be Warriors v Celtics, and let’s be honest here, that series would not have lasted very long. For the other series, the next biggest time zone differences are Trailblazers v Mavericks and Clippers v Pelicans, but those match ups could have happened in the current playoff setup as well. If you look at the previous years, the 3 hour time zone difference would have occurred 2 times in the 2013-2014 post season, 1 time in 2012-2013 post season, and 1 time in the 2011-2012 series (This is assuming that the top teams always win).  As these match-up only happening one or two times per post season, it would be stupid to let that from affecting the top 16 teams format. Another argument against having the top 16 teams going into the playoffs is that the eastern teams will not agree with it as less teams from that conference would not make the playoffs. Maybe for previous years that would have been the case, but as of right now, the Eastern teams would actually benefit from the top 16 teams going into the playoffs so right now is the perfect time to implement it for next season. Also, the way the playoffs are set up leads to undeserving teams playing in the post season where the deserving teams do not get in. In the long run, this hurts the undeserving teams as they are not eligible for the draft lottery and do have the chance of getting a good draft pick. Now let’s look at the pros of the top 16 team format. While last year there was only one amazing series and the rest being mediocre, there would be two good series and the rest being mediocre. The second round is where the talent really comes into play. The eastern conference finals from last year is now in the 2nd round and the Spurs make it to the next round where they would either play the Rockets or Thunder (both match-ups would be very entertaining). Both semifinals are final worthy series with Spurs v Cavaliers and Warriors v Clippers, which is WAY better than last year conference finals, and the winners then go on to play another entertaining series. Since Conferences will no longer be needed, I think the NBA should approach a five division format which mcfien has a good post about.  https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/3dvaip/realignment_a_5division_no_conference_format/TL;DR The top 16 teams going into the post season would be way better than the current format as it leads to more competitive playoff series. The time zone argument would on only happen once or twice and is not significant enough to be a big concern. It would also prevent unworthy team from going into the postseason to just be swept and they also are given the opportunity to gain more talent.

The Hawks, Celtics, Heat, and Hornets are all probably safe bets to make it in, but regardless, they'll still be fighting hard for home court in the first round.ProjectionsHere are the short breakdowns of their remaining games:*Projected wins are based on point spreads of remaining games, which take into account both home/away splits and remaining opponents.AtlantaLikely wins: at Bulls, vs Suns, vs CelticsLikely loss: at CavaliersTossups: at Raptors, vs Cavaliers, vs Raptors, at WizardsAtlanta has a tough finish, with 4 games left against the top two teams in the East, but I see them winning 4 or 5 out of 8.BostonLikely wins: at Lakers, vs Pelicans, vs Bucks, vs Hornets, vs HeatLikely losses: at Clippers, at Warriors, at HawksTossups: at Trail BlazersBoston has some winnable matchups at home, but a tough road schedule to finish the season - I expect them to come away with at least 4 and maybe 5 wins.MiamiLikely wins: vs Nets, at Lakers, vs Pistons, vs Bulls, vs MagicLikely losses: at Trail Blazers, at Pistons, at CelticsTossups: at Kings, at MagicLike Boston, Miami has 4 very winnable home games left, but should also pick up a couple wins on the road to finish the season strong.CharlotteLikely wins: at 76ers, vs 76ers, vs Nets, vs MagicLikely losses: at Cavaliers, at Raptors, at CelticsTossups: at Knicks, at WizardsShould have 3 easy home wins - and probably 2 or 3 close wins on the road.IndianaLikely wins: vs Bulls, vs Magic, at 76ers, vs Nets, vs KnicksLikely loss: at RaptorsTossups: at Knicks, vs Cavaliers, at BucksIndiana is the only team of these 8 that has more home than away games left - should help them hold onto their spot in the playoffs, but they aren't likely to catch up to Charlotte.DetroitLikely wins: vs Mavericks, vs Wizards, vs HeatLikely losses: at Heat, at CavaliersTossups: vs Thunder, at Bulls, at MagicDetroit is most at risk of losing their playoff spot - but they should stay at #8 and even make a play for #7 if they take care of business at home.ChicagoLikely wins: vs 76ersLikely losses: vs Hawks, at Pacers, at Rockets, at Grizzlies, at Heat, vs CavaliersTossups: vs Pistons, at Bucks, at PelicansChicago - ouch. I only see them being the favorite in two of their remaining games. They might be able to pick up a couple road wins, but unfortunately I see them missing the playoffs this year.WashingtonLikely wins: vs NetsLikely losses: at Warriors, at Clippers, at PistonsTossups: at Kings, at Suns, vs Hornets, vs HawksUnfavorable home/away split, and too much ground to make up - like the Bulls, the Wizards will likely be sitting out the playoffs.SummaryChicago and Washington will likely miss the playoffs, while Indiana and Detroit make it in as #7 and 8 in some order. Meanwhile, Atlanta, Boston, Miami, and Charlotte could still end up anywhere in #3-6.

the teams had split 1-1 in each of the five previous seasonsOnly one Hawk has ever topped 40+ against the Nuggets – that being John Drew with 50 on
12/30/78 in AtlantaOnly once since joining the NBA have the Nuggets failed to record a steal in a game, and that was at Atlanta on 10/21/78.Hawks assistant coach

37. etc......  Couple notes on the controversial placings
On Bledsoe - The guy is injured. He's obviously Tier 3 level, but we don't know what will happen when he comes back.
On Antetokounmpo - He's a monster at the moment, but if you watch the games, you see that it's still hard to run a team when the PG attracts to defender beyond 18 feet. He also hasn't played too many games at PG.
On Kyrie - The guy can score, but what else can he do? He's really bad at running a team, and horrible on defense. I think Kyrie is one of the most special and gifted player on the planet, but he hasn't developed since his rookie year. He might be the same player from Duke tbh.
On Rose - The guy has gotten a lot better since January. Overall, he has been pretty horrible though. The guy will probably end up moving up a lot next year granted he stays healthy.
On Rondo - He's really good skill wise, but he has a lot of flaws to his game and he doesn't try to win games. It's pretty embarrassing. Tier 3.5 caliber player.  Certain players that I believe to be better players are lower than other players based on limited minutes, role, and system they play in. For instance, I think Patty Mills is a much better player than Payton, yet he plays in a much better system and also has a easier role. He could move up a lot if I had a different measure.  I forgot to name some players such as Dcol, Douglas, and etc. Slot them in as you wish.  Tier 0/1 are superstars.
Tier 2 are stars.
Tier 3 are borderline stars/very good players. 
Tier 4 are players that can get all the way to Tier 2/3, but either are injured or playing below their usual levels.
Tier 5 are good players.
Tier 6 is when you seriously want an upgrade if they start for your team.
Tier 7 lord help you. Of course Mudiay and D'lo won't be in Tier 7 for that much longer, will probably both peak at Tier 2/3 level.
Thoughts? I watch all the teams a good bit, but I'm sure fans that watch all the games of a particular team might have different thoughts.  EDIT

7552,What the fuck did I just read,26,"We saw what he did last year. He put up crazy volume stats but was terribly inefficient at scoring if he doesn't have a top 3 player in the league to pass to.He averages over 10 assists, but he only gets the space to find passes because Durant gets so much attention on offense and spreads the floor. I think he's just a system player because he hasn't shown he can even lead a team to the playoffs. He needs a team to be built around him so he can do everything he does, like drive to the basket and dish out to shooters. His teammate is one of the best scorers in the league, shooting over 63% TS with 28 ppg, but Westbrook's usage rate is higher. Is there any player that can actually play with Westbrook who can be the 1st option? Honestly if Westbrook was on the same team as Michael Jordan in his prime, he would probably still be taking more shots than him. The dude thinks he's good enough to be a 1st option on a contender, but I don't think he is. He's just a system player who needs a team to be built around him to succeed, like Draymond Green.We saw in tonight's game that he shot 8-28 and played selfishly for most of the game. When he was out, the rest of the Thunder players made runs that got him back into the game. Then at the end of the game, he goes back to doing Westbrook things and loses the game for them in the last two minutes. I honestly don't think he's good enough as a 1st option, and just looks because of his volume stats, which he has the opportunity to put up because the coach is afraid to tell him to stop.",http://reddit.com/r/nba/comments/4civz5/c/d1ilgaw,1459305604,nba,Is Westbrook good enough to be the 1st option on a contender?

7593," I don't know if he's really confusing it, Stockton played hard *and* dirty.  He was a champ at throwing elbows where the ref couldn't see it while he was setting those screens.",4,"Let me preface this by saying that I haven't paid any attention to basketball for many years now. Football is now my sport.  But back in my day, John Stockton was the man. You may laugh at me. Be my guest. He is famous for his short shorts, after all. He is a white man who played in perhaps the ""whitest"" state ever: Utah. He was nowhere near as flashy as Jason ""White Chocolate"" Williams.   He wasn't a prolific scorer, because that wasn't his job. But with a career (19 seasons!) shooting percentage of .515, he scored seemingly at will. I remember he started off every game by driving for an easy deuce. He couldn't blaze passed most defenders. Rather, he used his body control masterfully to avoid the block while also jumping off his non-dominant leg on occasion.  He was clutch. Ice Man. Not just through scoring but also defending, passing, and rebounding. This clip illustrates this point perfectly. I also remember Stockton taking over games in the exciting Utah-Sacramento playoff series. Let's not forget Game 6 of the Western Conference Finals that sent the Jazz to their first ever NBA Finals. There were games where it seemed his point total came from the 4th quarter alone.  But it was his facilitation prowess that drew me to him. Stockton had the quickest, softest hands in the League. This served him well on both sides of the court. Combine this with elite court vision, you have a quietly lethal point guard. This point is seen in the above video where he snatches the rebound, dribbles once, then drops the ball nearly cross-court in The Mailman's bread basket in one smooth motion. Malone catches the ball in stride and over his shoulder as if it was a pass from Montana to Rice. Look at any Stockton highlight video, and you'll see him using the bounce pass masterfully. Often times, he was so quick with his passing that his nor his teammate's defender had any time to react.  So you may be wondering why I'm posting this. Well, friendo, it is John Stockton's birthday today. This is just my way of paying tribute to a man whom I had deep admiration and appreciation for in my young buck days. He was just a quiet man who did his job.

The 2nd and 4th have much lower differentials because the bench is playing about half the quarter. 4th quarter is lowered even more by blowout wins where the starters don't play.

7639,"In 1998, Michael Jordan was paid 30m by the Bulls.  He was, at that time, probably the best player in the NBA and certainly the biggest boxoffice draw in the NBA.

Lebron, Steph, and possibly KD would be the closest things we have today in terms of matching a star of that caliber.

According to a quick inflation calculation, that would equal (roughly) 45 million dollars in today's purchasing power.

That having been said, the TV market in the NBA is worth substantially more than it was back then, and ticket sale values are also substantially higher.

I think based on those numbers, it's safe to say Steph and Lebron probably have a market value (with no salary cap) of around 50 to 60 million per season.

And let's be real; if there were no salary cap, *there are certainly* a few teams who would gladly step up and pay those kind of numbers.  You think Dolan wouldn't pony up 55 million a year for Lebron?  You think Mark Cuban would say no to a 60 million a season deal for Steph?

7682,"&gt; His wins aren't impressive

Where did I say that? 

They had 33 games after the Anthony Davis 3. Losing those 7 of the last 11 games really hurt them as much as that 3, specially the 4 game losing streak. The wins are impressive, the triple doubles are always impressive, which leads people to expect more of him when he has the really bad nights. The teams record with him last year had some phenomenal performances, but when you look closer at the losses, they were some really ugly ones in there. Which is why I don't think your original statement is as strong. And that bad stretch to end January was with Ibaka &amp; Adams, and some with Durant as well. That 3-30 40pt game in the loss to the Knicks really stood out last year.

They're part of an incubator that is part of UC Berkeley, and are trying to solve difficult problems with technology and empower people.They showed me a demo video of how the transcription technology works - https://adagionode.herokuapp.com/?v=GvvH9gd1NjkThey also sent me a demo video for the BS Podcast, Ep. 74 - https://www.captiontree.com/?v=0B7YGByqif8The text is highlighted based on the dialogue at that particular time, so it really benefits millions of people with some type of hearing loss who can now just ""follow the bouncing ball"" and connect the text to the audio. This in turn helps them ""hear"" the dialogue clearly and makes it much easier for them to listen to and follow along on podcasts. For culturally Deaf people with no residual hearing, this technology still provides transcripts that they can just read without having to follow the dialogue at the same time. It's really cool stuff.
It seems like the software transcribes uploaded videos and podcasts, and then spits out a transcript. Volunteers would then go in and fix errors as needed, taking far less time needed than actually typing out the whole thing. So it would definitely be crowd sourced. I know I've said I'd much prefer the content producers felt obligated to provide the access to their readers/listeners/viewers, but this project could do wonders and allow podcasters a new audience of potentially millions more people with some degree of hearing loss who have difficulty with clearly hearing podcasts.Right now, I don't think anyone should go ahead and transcribe podcasts because I'm concerned about duplication efforts and all that. Once the project is up and about and fully in place, it would ensure no duplications occur and the work would be so much easier to complete. I'll be sure to update all of you when I learn more about the timeline.Thank you again for going ahead and typing the transcript. I greatly appreciated it and am touched!UPDATE 2 on 3-17-16 8:19 PM EST:A redditor contacted me and showed me a demo of a project that combines software with crowd sourcing for transcription, and I was floored. Having seen the idea in practice, I'm really excited for the potentials. I think millions of people with some degree of hearing loss will finally get to enjoy podcasts, good and crappy.  I'll be sure to update everyone after the project is finalized and ready for use. UPDATE on 3-17-16:Someone created a blogspot site at http://bstranscripts.blogspot.com/2016/03/bill-simmons-podcast-episode-76-chuck.html for the Klostermann transcript. Several other people also graciously sent me partial or full transcripts. I feel bad because I didn't update my post until two days later with this new information.However, I am asking that you guys not do this. I sincerely believe the onus is on the content producers to provide the transcripts, and it sends the wrong message to them that people not involved with the production can take care of the situation for the ones who SHOULD be involved with this work. Please don't do any of these, and thank you for the ones you did do!All I ask is you keep bugging Simmons, Lowe, Woj, and all the other prominent podcasters for them to provide transcripts for their podcasts. When they are getting these requests in response to every post they make on social media, I am hopeful that will be enough for the change I am hoping to see.And just on an aside, please don't feel the need to feel bad for me or pity me because I am Deaf. I LOVE BEING DEAF. If you gave me a pill tomorrow that would make me hearing again, I wouldn't take it. I repeat: I LOVE BEING DEAF. I have a wonderful job, an amazing wife, and twins that are due in early April. I don't know why I was given gold just for making an open letter to Bill Simmons. I'm not complaining, mind you, but I don't really want it if it's just because the people giving it to me felt bad for me. If this all comes off as being ungrateful, that's not my intention. I truly felt all of your warmth and compassion, and I'm thankful if you guys could do nothing more but constantly pester Simmons et al to provide transcripts for their podcasts.Dear Bill Simmons,You're my favorite sportswriter ever. I've been reading your content since before you joined ESPN. Then the podcast era began, and as a Deaf person, I had no way of accessing the auditory content. Almost 10 years ago, you included me in a mailbag when I asked for accessibility, and you apologized because ESPN would not be able to offer transcripts for your podcast, the BS Report. You explained that you did not have the power to change this at that time.When you broke off from ESPN, I sent you quite a few emails and comments on social media requesting that you look into a way to provide podcast transcripts for your millions and millions of Deaf and hard-of-hearing fans who cannot access your content. And still, nothing has happened.You're Bill freaking Simmons. If anyone can do it, it's you. When Bill Simmons starts providing transcripts for every podcast to his Deaf and hard-of-hearing fans, it's setting an example for everyone else to follow. This is basically my last resort. I know you glance at Reddit, so I'm gambling that you'll read this or someone close to you will send this to you. Or maybe Zach Lowe will see this, or somebody close to him in ESPN, who can get the ball rolling on this. I am an NBA die-hard, and it kills me every single time I see everyone talking about the latest Lowe podcast or the latest Simmons podcast, because the only way I can access the content is by looking through the comments on R/NBA related to those podcasts. It kills me. It's been almost 10 years since the podcast era began, and virtually nothing has been done regarding this accessibility issue. I'm begging for a response, Bill. Just give me something.

7880,"Well I think it depends on what exactly your claim is.  I mean, if you are talking about him having periods were he was a top 5 player in the league over the past 10 seasons, I don't think anyone that followed the NBA over that span could be stupid enough to disagree with you.

What he did in '08-'09 is enough to put a pretty clear end to that debate in the chance that anyone wants to disagree.

On the other hand, if you are talking about top 5 player overall for the past decade, then I think you run into the problem that most fans don't break it down that rigidly by years.

I mean, if you make a hard limit of just the past 10 years from today, I think that Wade prob makes the list of top 5, but I think this is due, in part to the fact that this is the absolute perfect time frame for him.  If you go with the last 8 years or you go with the last 15 years, I'm not sure he still makes the top 5.

Also, shouldn't have to say this, but I'm going to any way since I know people get defensive about Wade.

7958,Let's not pretend like he wasn't already disliked before this happened though. It just gave the haters another reason to continue hating him.,1,"Not trying to flamebait here, but here's the thing: LeBron has never done anything to my team that I'll hate him forever for. Sure he's beat us in the NBA Finals but we've lost in the Playoffs before. If anything I'll hate Ray Allen for that. LeBron isn't more arrogant than other superstars. Kobe and Jordan were worlds cockier and more open about it. All indicates point to LBJ being a good guy. Then why does he get more hate than other stars?But when LeBron does something I scrutinize him more than other stars. For example, if LeBron complains to the refs I'll get annoyed at him for always looking for calls but when Wade/CP3/Harden/Blake do it I really don't care or mind. Is it because of his looks? That he just naturally looks like a villain with his muscles/brawn and scowl? That he just naturally looks like a bully? I think this has a lot to do with why people hate him. If he was very skinny I don't think people would hate on him as much (but then he wouldn't be LeBron, yeah I know).What do you guys think? Does LeBron's resting angry face/scowl and his big muscles make him more of a 'villain' or 'bully' caricature than other stars, making him more susceptible to hate?",http://reddit.com/r/nba/comments/4b4nzo/c/d169cfa,1458436423,nba,[Serious] Is LeBron hated for his looks?,0,4b4nzo,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/4b4nzo,1458345600

Really was an all time individual performance",2,"Two I didn't like were 2007 and 2010.2007- I don't blame this sweep on the Spurs or the Cavs.The way the playoffs played out- Mavs/Warriors, no reseeding, the Suns/Spurs Horry/Nash/Amare controversy, a lot of interesting matchups going by the wayside- it was a major letdown from what I felt was a tremendous 2006 playoffs. Really, it would have taken a perfect storm to follow that up- and we got an imperfect storm.Also, I felt like that was honestly a lesser of two evils because trust me, damn near everybody was gonna revolt over another Spurs/Pistons series.More than anything, this series makes me wonder how the Pistons blew that series and why their series collapse isn't remembered more. I think it's the most underrated chokejob in NBA history. Given the rosters and head coaches, Detroit quite frankly got off the hook for that gagjob given all we heard about how awful those Finals were (And that's coming from someone who wanted the Cavs to win because I did NOT want Pistons-Spurs II- which by no means would have been a better series.) It is one of the biggest chokes in NBA playoff history. And yet had they won, the Finals wouldn't have been THAT much better.2010- The NBA Playoffs started with a lot of unique promise and potential. But as the playoffs went on, a lot of the interesting teams fell by the wayside. No Lebron/Kobe, no Melo/LeBron, no Lakers/Magic rematch, no 2010 Suns (a team that I found captivating). OKC and Portland got the wrong draws. No Orlando Finals redemption, no possible Finals for Nash/HillI HATED that Lakers/Celtics Finals so much, even moreso than the much maligned 2005 Spurs/Pistons Finals. I took absolutely no joy in that series. They had won before, so it didn't have any of that new car smell if you will. By that time, the Lakers/Kobe were basically the biggest thing in sports and I was essentially Lakered out.It was the least enjoyable seven-game series ever, so much so that I rooted for the Celtics to win game six just so I didn't have to see another game.Then, I just watched game seven so it could end. Basically the same final score as SAS/DET game 7, only it didn't even have a memorable game ala Horry in game 5.Thank goodness things picked up after that.

8076,"Terrible decisions aside, watching the wiz consistently be terrible on defense is why I want Wittman gone.",1,"During last nights game against the Warriors, Wizards coach Randy Wittman displayed, what I think, true genius that only the best of head coaches could pull off.To start the 4th quarter, Steph Curry and Draymond Green sat the bench. In fact, they sat until the 6:41 minute mark in that quarter. The Wizards were presented with a golden opportunity to claw back into the game against the Warriors, down by 7, 72-79, going into the 4th.Now, most would assume that a head coach would attempt to take advantage of Curry and Green sitting by running plays designed around Markieff Morris, John Wall, and Bradley Beal. And Wittman did, but after seeing Beal, Wall, and Morris miss a couple of unlucky shots, The mystical Playoff Wittman made a return. Wittman opted to instruct the Wizards to feed the ball to Nene in the post, and let who he must think is the reincarnation of Hakeem Olajuwon
go to work down low. The genius part of this move was Wittman knowing that Nene shoots an incredulous 58% from the free throw line, so GSW couldn't even hack him. Nene, it's safe to say, made the Warriors pay down low, making one shot out of four attempts, and missing five free throws out of eight. Out there against GSW, Nene looked like an MVP candidate, and had them running scared.The Golden State Warriors won 102-94.I, along with many other Wizards fans, feel blessed to have a basketball savant like Wittman as our coach, and so would many other teams in this league. Sarcasm aside... Yes, I know that the Wizards were not supposed to win this game. Yes, Steph and Klay had pretty average shooting games percentage wise. And yes, Wall, Beal, and Morris shot pretty bad percentages, so maybe a change of game plan was needed to come back into the game. However, is feeding the ball to the 33 year old, ghost of his former self Nene Hilario the answer when you have an All-Star like John Wall, a Maniac in Markieff, and Borderline All-Star when healthy and hopefully not Eric Gordon 2.0 Bradley Beal on the team? Maybe I'm alone on this, but I'd rather lose a game because my star players couldn't play like stars, rather than our bench Center's inability to carry us. Is what I'm saying crazy? Maybe. I don't know, I'm not a coach, I'm just some armchair analyst who happens to be a depressed Wizards fan. This is just some food for thought, and not good food either.

8234,Except Shump and JR were playing like scrubs in the finals...,2,"Lets dispel once and for all with this fiction that LeBron James is no longer an elite defender, and is not having a stellar defensive season this year. I know the more informed among us are already aware, but lately I’ve seen an alarming number of misguided NBA fans making this assertion after the narrative shift stemming from last year’s campaign and to an extent, from his final year with the Heat as well. I want to set the record straight. LeBron is currently the second most impactful SF defender in the league, after Kawhi Leonard.  It appears that LeBron has decided, whether due to health, mentality, coaching, or otherwise, to buckle down this season and get back to being an every night force on the defensive end. This isn’t to say he doesn’t take possessions off, but rather to say that his consistency and effectiveness is much improved from the last two seasons. Lets take a look at the numbers with Kawhi as a reference point, based on all the decent individual defensive statistics I could scrounge up across BBref, NBA.com, and ESPNs rpm chart. LeBron 8.3 DFGA, 37.5 DFG% for a -7.3 FG diff%, #1 for Forwards3pt DFGA: 1/3.2 (31.3%, -3.4 diff%) 2pt DFGA: 2.1/5.1 (41.2%, -7.7 diff%)DBPM: 2.1 #3 for SFsDRPM: 2.45 #2 for SFsD Win Shares: 3.6 #3 for SFs (team related)Kawhi9.4 DFGA 39.4 DFG% -5.3 diff% #4 for Forwards3pt:1/2.8 (34.8%, -.2 diff%)2pt:2.7/6.6 (41.4% -7.3 diff%)DBPM:2.7 #2 SFDRPM:4.60 #1 SFD Win Shares:5.2 #1 SF (team related)As you can see, LeBron’s individual defense is stellar. He forces his matchup to shoot over 7% worse than their average per game, including 10% worse from inside of 6 feet (not shown). As opposed to Kawhi, he won’t usually guard away from his position, but when it comes to opposing star SFs, we’ve seen him take the challenge multiple times this year vs. Melo, KD, Kawhi, and PG. His other metrics lag behind Kawhi by either 1 or two spots, and (trigger warning) I’d be personally interested to see what his DRPM would look like if the Cavs had a rim protector of Duncan’s caliber and/or didn’t play with Love and Kyrie most of the time.  I do think one thing is clear here, however: LeBron is no slouch, only lagging behind the reigning DPOY in defensive impact at the Small Forward position. In the playoffs, he’ll be tasked with toeing the fine line between playing more desperate defense (i.e. fouling more, blocking more shots, not taking possessions off) and conserving energy for the offensive burden he carries. Last year’s Finals were a case of him needing to do everything, which impacted his defense and his shooting percentages. As his quickness and stamina wane with age, it will be interesting to see how he maintains in the seasons to come, but for the moment, he remains elite in every interpretation of the word.

[EDIT: Tried to fix formatting. And for those who live in terrible places - take a joke!]When NBA players reach the rare points of their careers when they actually have the unfettered discretion to choose where they want to live and play basketball, they choose different places for different reasons. Where would he have the best opportunity to contend for a championship? Who can pay him the most money? Where can he be the number one option and play the way he wants to play? Who has the best coach and front office? Which city has the best weather? Which city has the best clubs? The best strip clubs? Proximity to models? Proximity to Kardashians? Where did he grow up?Recently, every slight compliment that Kevin Durant bestows on a team or a town leads to wild speculation of where he will play next season. As the biggest free agent since Lebron took his talents to South Beach in 2010 and since he took his somewhat fading talents back to Lake Erie in 2014, there is good reason to speculate about KD’s future. In all likelihood, his carefully crafted decision will lead to five years of playing for the Larry O’Brien trophy no matter which jersey he dons.The complexities of the Collective Bargaining Agreement, the increasing intelligence of most front offices in the league (sorry Sacramento), and the ability to be marketable from anywhere in a globalized economy have changed the way that players make decisions. It is no longer about forcing yourself to the biggest market, which historically, have been the places where a player was most likely to win. A monstrous television deal that will only increase in the next couple of years has leveled the playing field. As has a CBA where a team actually has to plan and make smart decisions to manage their salary cap situation.But let’s pretend that it’s just about the city and the history of the franchise (but not the active basketball operations, coach and players. So – for example – we can say Michael Jordan played there! But, we cannot factor in Fred Hoiberg, the general current management of the team or the fact that you can play with Jimmy Butler). All else being equal – which NBA locations/teams are the most attractive to NBA players? Remember, we are looking at this from the perspective of young millionaires.BIG CITY, BRIGHT LIGHTS:Los Angeles LakersIt used to be like the rap wars of the mid-1990s. East Coast or West Coast? Biggie or Pac? New York or L.A.? Los Angeles had Hollywood opportunities (What if I told you that you get play a 7 foot genie, star alongside Francis Capra and Da Brat and be directed by the genius behind The Cutting Edge and three episodes of Miami Vice?) Jack Nicholson watching courtside, young actresses (and aspiring ones) flooding the Forum Club and then Hyde at the Staples Center. You could have a mansion in Beverly Hills or on the Strand in Manhattan Beach. A player could enjoy the finest well-done steaks at Mastro’s.Or you could live in a Park Avenue penthouse. Give high-fives to Jay-Z. Get your boy a guest spot on Law & Order SVU. 4:00 a.m. nights with models in Tribeca and SOHO. And most importantly, being in the center of the media universe could make you as marketable as…Patrick Ewing?But times have changed. In the age of Twitter and Vine, League Pass, and nationally televised games, no matter where you are, players don’t needNew York. They don’t need L.A. But they still want L.A. The perfect weather and the pull of Hollywood, which remains the epicenter of the entertainment industry. A place where you can blend in and be afforded a little more privacy because residents are more excited by encounters with Jax fromVanderpump Rules.Los Angeles remains the place where you can play for one of the two most storied teams in the league, while being able to roll along Pacific Coast Highway in a convertible maroon Bentley on a 78 degree January afternoon.It is the Lakers history that puts L.A. at the top. Veterans grew up watching the late Magic years. Younger players grew up watching the Kobe-Shaq dynasty or the Kobe-Pau years. The games under the Showtime lighting, framed yellow jerseys and 16 championship banners just feel different. It is one thing to be an NBA player. It is a whole other to be a Laker.Miami HeatIt’s pretty much Los Angeles, but with the occasional hurricane, worse humidity, and Cuban telenovelas instead of big-budget motion pictures. Miami still has the beach and the clear and beautiful warm waters of South Florida. NBA players love neon lights and other bright shit, making South Beach a favorite. There are the palm trees and the waterfront mansions. A player can still date models. Prime 112 has tempura lobster (A Jalen Rose favorite).Alonzo Mourning and the late 1990s teams brought legitimacy to a new organization. Dwyane Wade and Pat Riley turned them into a premiere franchise and Lebron and the big-three era catapulted the Heat to arguably becoming the most marquee NBA franchise, other than the Lakers and Spurs, in the post-Jordan era.Also, in case you forgot every Cribs episode, never underestimate an NBA player’s adoration for Scarface.BIG CITY, NOT AS BRIGHT LIGHTS:Los Angeles ClippersBasically the Lakers, but with selfies hanging inside Staples instead of championship banners and nostalgia for Eric Piatkowski instead of Magic Johnson.The trash organization gained legitimacy when the NBA evicted their slumlord owner and brought in a tech billionaire whose products are not used by a single person in Los Angeles, most of whom are working on Broad City spec scripts at their local coffee shop.The marketability factor is still present with opportunities for players to be the king of insurance or mid-tier Korean family sedans.It’s still Los Angeles and a player can always go out on Sunset and pretend he is on the Lakers.New York KnicksWe pretend the Knicks are the unheralded kings of free agency. That everyone dreams of playing at the Garden and living in New York. But unless you grew up in the five boroughs - no one liked Ewing, Starks, Oak and Anthony Mason (RIP). Most NBA players would not know if Bernard King played on the Knicks between 1983-1987 or 1963-1967. The oldest active player in the NBA (the professor, Andre Miller) was born approximately three years AFTER the Knicks last won an NBA championship. Sorry, the Knicks aren’t a premiere NBA organization. And this is without even mentioning James Dolan.And - contrary to popular opinion - New York City is not the premiere place to live if you are an NBA superstar. A player would rather live in a sprawling 8,000 square foot mansion with a regulation sized basketball court, shark tank, nine-hole golf course, and a Ritz Carlton quality pool than pay $10 million for a 2,000 square foot apartment or brownstone.Your average NBA player would rather eat at The Cheesecake Factory than the awesome hole-in-the-wall Pho spot or David Chang’s latest Michelin rated restaurant.NBA players aren’t known to spend Saturday afternoons strolling the Museum of Modern Art or checking out trendy and provocative performance art projects in Bushwick warehouses.It isn’t 1981, so nearly every NBA city has some semblance of nightlife where a player can enjoy a bottle of Dom P, VIP area, and have a flock of jersey-chasers clamoring for attention.NBA players don’t fuck with the Subway.New York is really cold during approximately 80% of the NBA regular season.But even though I spent approximately 300 words shitting on New York, it’s still New York. Just ask JR Smith.[NOTE – THIS ABOVE PARAGRAPH DOES NOT APPLY TO YOU IF YOU ARE MARRIED TO LA LA].Brooklyn NetsThe team’s history is buried in a swamp in New Jersey. The legacy of the team since it has moved to Brooklyn centers around former stars who were collective decades removed from their primes.NBA players are not Lena Dunham.It’s still New York, but not quite.Basically the New York Clippers.Having a Russian Oligarch multi-billionaire for an owner is pretty cool.NOT L.A. OR MIAMI, BUT THE WEATHER IS NICEHouston RocketsIt’s hot. There is good food and lots of chain restaurants. Huge houses for cheap and no state taxes. Paul Wall, Mike Jones (who?) and Chamillionaire were at the height of their popularity when most of these guys were in junior high and high school.Hakeem might help you with your footwork.Allegedly, great strip clubs.Dallas MavericksIt’s hot. There are quality steakhouses and lots of chain restaurants. Huge houses for cheap and no state taxes. Unfortunately, no strong rap history.No one to help you with your footwork, but Cuban provides the best perks (remember when he put a Playstation 2 in every player’s locker back in 2002?)A lot of players are Dallas Cowboys fans because they are front-running assholes who grew up with the Irvin, Emmett and Aikman teams.Allegedly, great strip clubs.And if Chandler Parsons chose to play there you know it is a good time.Phoenix SunsIt’s really hot. There are lots of chain restaurants. Huge houses for cheap, but there are state taxes. Unfortunately, no strong rap history.NBA players treat Phoenix as if it is a distant suburb of Los Angeles.Few models, but plenty of surgically enhanced cleavage and Arizona State Coeds.More NBA players than you think golf.Pool parties where players can wear socks, rubber Nike sandals, and two pairs of oversized basketball shorts.The Steve Nash teams revolutionized basketball and rescued the NBA from the 84-79 point games era. Barkley took them to the Finals against Jordan and maybe a player can get invited to his poker game (hope he makes a max-level salary!)Orlando MagicPlayers have been known to live on lakes and jet-ski to each other’s houses to play Madden, which sounds like exactly the kind of life I would have liked to have led when I was 17.The weather is really nice and it’s almost tropical.It’s basically Miami, but rednecks instead of Latin people and New York retirees, lakes instead of the ocean, and strip malls and Disney World instead of any semblance of nightlife.
Those D12 teams were underrated (beat Lebron in his prime), but no one has ever said “Dwight Howard did it, so you know it is a good idea.” Some goodwill remains from the Penny-Shaq era. Everyone forgets that T-Mac and Grant Hill played here.THE CITIES THAT SHOULD BE HIGHERAtlanta HawksIt is a mystery why Atlanta is not a more popular NBA city. You would think Atlanta would be at the center of the Venn diagram of where rappers and NBA players want to live. But apparently, NBA players don’t care too much about fraternizing with 2 Chainz, Outkast, Ludacris, Jermaine Dupri, Gucci Mane, Lil Jon, and Young Jeezy.It isn’t San Diego, but the weather is nice. The food is good. You can buy a Southern estate for about the price of a condo in Inglewood. You might be able to get a cameo on The Real Housewives of Atlanta.Freaknik is in Atlanta, even though its heyday has long since passed.It’s at the top of the list of where traveling NBA players play like shit. Atlanta has arguably the best clubs of NBA cities that are not Los Angeles, New York, or Miami.Of course, I have to bring up The Gold Club, where you can feel free to hang around a little bit and talk to them, then leave.It’s one of the two major African-American metropoles in the country.Highlights of the Hawks history are basically limited to the 2015 team getting swept in the conference finals, that time Joe Johnson hit a three, and Dominique Wilkins almost (he should have) beating MJ in the 1988 dunk contest. Maybe that’s why guys don’t want to play here.Washington WizardsAffectionately nicknamed Chocolate City.But basketball has really never mattered in DC outside of Georgetown hoops.THEY ARE REALLY GOOD AT BASKETBALL, BUT THAT’S ABOUT IT:San Antonio SpursWhat would San Antonio be without the Spurs? The answer is El Paso. No one wants to live in El Paso.This is a good reminder that this list does not consider the strength of the present-day organization, but it does factor in the history of the organization.Therefore, the Spurs get a bump for having five titles, four of which no one cares much about. There’s a better chance of Fox News covering a Bernie Sanders rally than Hardwood Classics ever airing a game from the New Jersey Nets and San Antonio Spurs 2003 Finals.San Antonio is, in essence, Dallas or Houston, but they tend to fare worse in the most obese cities rankings, more residents speak Spanish, and the chain restaurants are next to a dirty river.I am not sure any NBA players remember the Alamo.REMEMBER THAT WE ARE NOT FACTORING IN STEPH CURRY:Golden State WarriorsTwo years ago you would probably agree with this placement. Now you probably think I am insane, stupid or both.But in my completely arbitrary and not very well contemplated rules for this exercise, you don’t get to factor in playing with Steph and company, but you do get to factor in the insane current popularity of the franchise, which has been propelled by Steph and company. So – ummm – make sense?Until this ongoing Warriors run, Golden State was akin to Milwaukee west.The years of Run TMC were all too brief and the most prominent superstar (before Steph) claimed by this franchise shot free throws underhand and is widely regarded as the most despised Top-50 player and champion in league history.And as much as tech-bros are popularizing Northern California, NBA players aren’t exactly swayed by the most European of NBA cities. Other than Boris Diaw and Tony Parker, not many NBA guys would enjoy a nice red at a sidewalk café on a foggy San Francisco afternoon and coordinate team day-trips to Napa.BIG CITIES, SHIT IT’S COLD:Chicago BullsThe greatest of all-time wore number 23. No NBA team’s identity is as much ingrained in the image of a single player. The Lakers are the Lakers even without one of Kareem, West, Wilt, Magic, Shaq, or Kobe. The Celtics are the Celtics even without one of Bill Russell, Bird, KG, or Pierce.The Bulls are the Timberwolves without Jordan. MJ has rewritten the history of the franchise so extensively that people forget that they were one of the league’s most dogshit franchises when they drafted Jordan out of North Carolina.To play in Chicago is to follow in Jordan’s footsteps, but unfortunately, the shadow he casts is so large that players are hesitant to fill those Air Jordan’s. Lebron – allegedly – scoffed when Chicago’s pitch to him in 2010 was exactly that. The Bulls sent him a pair of Jordans with an accompanying message: “Do you dare to fill these shoes?” We know how he answered. “Fuck no!” And that seems to be the attitude that modern superstars hold.Why would I go to a team where – no matter what I do and how many championships I win – I’ll never be Michael?Chicago is the pride of the prairie. It’s the grandest American city outside of L.A. or NYC. But it is also the windy city and the most frigid big city in the country, where gusts off of Lake Michigan will literally pain your bones. Unless you are an opera connoisseur, it doesn’t hold much appeal over many of the NBA’s mid-sized cities.There’s a reason in Kanye West’s Good Life, he raps: “The good life, it feel like Atlanta, it feel like L.A., it feel like Miami. It feel like N.Y., summertime Chi, ahhh, now throw your hands up in the sky.”Summertime Chi. As in – great place to play for the Cubs! But stay the fuck away during the NBA season.Boston CelticsHow can the team with the most championships in NBA history be as low as 15? Why are the Celtics ranked below the Bulls when they have 11 more titles?Because even though Boston has the richest basketball history in the NBA, it also has - well - Boston history. Just ask Bill Russell about that.Even if Boston is a more friendly city to African-Americans in 2016 than the city was in 1966, it still has never been a free agent destination. The recent Big 3 era was orchestrated via trades rather than free agency, even if KG ultimately agreed to join Pierce and Jesus Shuttlesworth to win his first and only ring. But he was apprehensive, even calling Bill Russell to seek advice. Boston is a tremendous place to live, to go to college or graduate school, to be Irish, and the optimal place to be if you’re a fan of the Dropkick Murphy’s, where bagpipe-punk ballads are bar staples on far more than just St. Patrick’s Day.Memories of the Garden and Bird and the other several hall-of-famers certainly serves as a strong recruiting factor.But when New England poet Robert Frost poses the question about two roads diverged in a yellow wood, the NBA millionaire is not going to choose either road that leads to the frigid Boston winters, no matter how pretty the foliage when the season begins.Toronto RaptorsIt is Canada. Which is not the United States. Which means it is a pain in the ass to deal with currency conversion. And you have to file taxes (which are higher in Canada) in two separate countries.Toronto is possibly the most metropolitan and lively large North American city outside of New York. Because I have not been to Toronto as an adult, I Googled the best clubs in the city to get a feel for how well those Canada nights complement the life of an NBA star. Number one as of July 2015 was Uniun, which sounds like a failing Vegas club at New York, New York, which not so successfully attempts to emulate some chic Manhattan spot. Here is the description: “Owned by the Ariana Grande of the Toronto club scene, Charles Khabouth…” So yeah, apparently a Lebanese Canadian club owner and hotelier in his fifties is the Ariana Grande of the Toronto club scene. Makes sense.Some other Union gems: BEERS ON TAP: None, but bottles of Heineken, Coors, Corona, and Molson Canadian.BAR SNACKS: None as of yet.WHO GOES THERE: Dressed-up fans of electronic music, beautiful people in their 20s and 30s.That place sounds TERRIBLE. I bet Jonas Valanciunas has a standing table reservation.In Toronto, English is still the primary language. While perhaps too similar to the Bratislava clubs in Eurotrip, there are numerous nightlife options. There is an abundance of diversity. Most importantly for NBA players, there is a Benihana!But it is cold. Really cold. Like colder than Boston, Chicago or New York cold. And if you’re learning anything from this list, it’s that NBA players do not like being in the cold. Which is a primary reason that the Western Conference has been dominant for two decades. Even if NBA players have a debaucherous time on the road when traveling up to The North - it’s hard to shake the perceptions that are formed in childhood. And nearly every NBA player grew up thinking of Canada, even places like Toronto, as an uninhabited frozen wasteland with the occasional igloo and Eskimo. Three years ago Toronto would be ten spots lower on this list, but it’s helpful to have your ambassador and biggest celebrity fan be the most popular rapper on the planet. Drake might be worth more to this franchise than Lebron is worth to Cleveland. MEMPHIS:Memphis GrizzliesIt’s a smaller town than the warmer cities listed above and the weather is less desirable. It’s one of the top cities for BBQ in the country, and perhaps, the best of any NBA city. Beale Street is apparently fun.It is more of a blue-collar city than NBA players typically prefer, but at least it is not in the Rust Belt.  It is rated higher than similarly sized and geographically located cities Charlotte and New Orleans because the grit & grind era gave Memphis a distinct basketball identity that resonates with fans. The three most exhilarating things currently in the NBA are Russell Westbrook attacking the rim at full speed, Steph Curry pulling up from 40 and the Memphis PA system bumping Whoop That Trick during a crucial fourth quarter playoffs timeout. If only NBA players were bigger fans of Elvis.THE GREAT OUTDOORS:Portland TrailblazersThe last remaining frontier of professional basketball in the Great American Northwest. Portland, as a city, has undergone a surge of popularity among America’s twenty-somethings, inspiring such articles as the Washington Post’s Why quirky Portland is winning the battle for young college grads.Oregon has lakes, streams, rivers, trees and picturesque mountains. It also has one of America’s most infamous foodie scenes and thousands of clones of young Bill Walton, albeit the political and socially-conscious new anti-yuppies of Portland lack The Big Redhead’s size and athletic ability. But riding a fixie bike does keep those quads strong.While natural scenic beauty and hiking have not historically been strong sellers to NBA free agents, Portland - or at least nearby Beaverton - does have one thing that turns the heads of young athletes…The Swoosh. The Blazers also boast an NBA title, one of the better logo/color scheme combinations in professional sports, a devoted cult-like local following, and hall-of-famers across multiple generations. If only it did not rain so fucking much.Denver Nuggets I’d personally rather live in Denver than any NBA city outside of Los Angeles, but I reckon I enjoy snowboarding, the mountains and IPAs more than your average professional basketball player. My team-building strategy for the Nuggets would be to target all Euro stars and convince them that living in the mile high city is like residing in an eighties ski movie, which it probably is for Gallinari. Vail and Aspen are surely suitable stand-ins for the Swiss Alps. I would also try to work on getting Kendrick Lamar a residency at Red Rocks. Unfortunately, among the most forgotten teams and players from the eighties were the really fun Fat Lever and Alex English led scoring machines. Fresh in the minds of most players is Melo’s slow and painful mid-season exit and there’s no other recent period in Nuggets history which serves as a draw for free agents.But once the NBA gets out of the weed regulation business and ceases testing for non-performance enhancing drugs and non-narcotics, you can go ahead and bump the Nugs up a spot or ten. THE PROCESS:Philadelphia 76ersThe city of brotherly love is the fifth largest United States city. But just because it is big doesn’t mean that there is anything notable about the town. No one talks about the restaurants or the bars or the museums or anything that has really happened since the 18th century. There is the liberty bell, so that’s cool? Most people only know about Philadelphia because of Ben Franklin book reports in fourth grade. Alllen Iverson was just interviewed by Complex Magazine and said his favorite thing to do in Philly was go to TGI Fridays. But people remember Dr. J and Moses Malone. And more recently, Allen Iverson had his best years in Philly and brought them to the Finals and I am not going to underestimate AI’s impact, as he is up there with Jordan as one of the most iconic and culturally transformative players to ever pick up an orange ball. Too bad Sam Hinkie has worked his hardest to demolish a once proud franchise’s reputation.At least Philadelphia is not Milwaukee or Detroit.NICE CLIMATE, TOO REGIONAL:New Orleans PelicansI don’t have a lot of history to go on here, since The Big Easy has been a permanent NBA town for about a decade. It seems like a pleasant enough place to live. It is inexpensive. The cuisine is excellent. You can hear the best Jazz of your life on an unassuming street corner. You can legally walk down the street with a drink in your hand. You can legally gamble. No one seems to mind if you urinate outside a bar in the French Quarter at five in the morning. There are Southern mansions and a quieter life available in the burbs. Cash Money records reps the 504, but unfortunately, I’m not sure Lil Wayne carries the same weight in 2016 as he did when he ruled the aughts. There’s an NCIS here now. The weather is mostly mild during the NBA season, but the worst natural disaster in United States history likely still looms large in player’s minds. Even if it is home to Mardi Gras and is essentially the Vegas of the American South, it’s still a very small town and that historically has not played well with NBA dudes. I just have the feeling it’s more likely for a player’s bachelor party than it is as a permanent residence. But New Orleans’ place on this list should be revisited in five or so years.Charlotte HornetsEveryone in Charlotte is a bank teller, financial analyst at a large commercial bank, works for the Federal Reserve or worships at the altar of Dale Earnhardt. I am surprised that the professional sports teams in the state don’t have a permanent 3 patched onto the breast of the team jerseys. Charlotte is where SEC and ACC grads end up if they didn’t get jobs in Atlanta.Other than middle-management at a regional office and NASCAR, when I think of Charlotte, one other thing comes to mind - college hoops. Jordan, Worthy, Stackhouse, Vince, Sheed and Dean Smith. Tar Heels versus Blue Devils. Pro basketball has already died once in Charlotte, but was singlehandedly resurrected by the greatest basketball player of all-time who just so happened to be from the state. If MJ was raised in Detroit, L.A. or Chicago, the Charlotte Hornets would be the Seattle Sonics 2.0 or the Kansas City Jayhawks. But every male between 30 and 35 years old, no matter where they grew up in the U.S., had a teal Hornets Starter Jacket. If the Hornets want to increase their free agency rankings, they need to go back to their early-to-mid 90s LJ and Zo throwback attire. They also need to make Grandmama the permanent mascot. And at least for the next five to seven years - the front office can lure free agents with 50 yard line seats to see Cam Newton. FACTORY TOWNS AND KIND OF A CALIFORNIA TOWN:Detroit PistonsThe epicenter of the desolate remains of once proud American manufacturing. If you sign with the Pistons, they may be able to hook you up with a good deal on a Ford Explorer. Living options are between a dilapidated warehouse in downtown Detroit or a 10,000 square foot mansion in a Pleasantville-esque suburb, which are similar to the Northside burbs of Chicago, but if Chicago itself no longer existed and it was even colder. But the Pistons do well with adopting the persona of Detroit toughness. From the Bad Boys to the Billups-Rip-Tayshaun-Sheed-Ben Wallace squad.So a player can feel good about being perceived as a badass, but will soon learn why everyone respects his toughness and resilience, he has to live in Detroit.Sacramento KingsIt sounds appealing to work and live in the capital of California, until you realize that the capital of California is Sacramento.The current Kings arena – Sleep Train (formerly Arco) – is located in a cow pasture.The best thing about Sacramento is the approximate 100 mile distance to Lake Tahoe and 90 mile distance to San Francisco. When your best selling point is being located not that far away from better places, it does not speak all that highly about your city. Sacramento…at least we’re not Barstow.The Maloof bros sold, so there is no longer access to free Vegas depravity.The Webber-Bibby-Peja-Vlade years were fun, but the franchise has since slowly slid into complete chaos and incompetence.They should just ditch the new digs and move to Orange County (which would immediately be a top three free agent destination), where players can live in Newport and Laguna Beach and not have to wait until retirement to hit on cougars at Javier’s.Indiana PacersReggie Miller scoring eight points in nine seconds and miming the choking sign to Spike Lee single-handedly keeps the Pacers out of the bottom of the barrel.Aside from Hoosiers, Bobby Knight, Peyton Manning before the neck, Andrew Luck, Parks and Recreation, the beginning of The Jackson 5 and the non-NASCAR kind of racing, I don’t know much about Indiana. I know Notre Dame is in South Bend, but the Irish pretty much exist independently of the State.Apparently you can fish there, which Roy Hibbert and Paul George taught us that a friendly team fishing expedition can heal deep wounds.So…here we are. Indiana!Cleveland CavaliersI’ll start with the obvious – if I was factoring in playing with Lebron, the Cavs would be near the top of these rankings. Although, Kevin Love and Kyrie Irving might argue differently.Before Lebron Round One, the most iconic Cavs moment was Jordan nailing the double-pump, buzzer beating jumper in the 1989 playoffs and sending Craig Ehlo crying to his knees.During the early Lebron years, the Cavs are most remembered for wilting twice in the playoffs and being subsequently deserted by The King for the number two squad on this list.Cleveland rests on the shores of water so disgusting and polluted, that Lake Erie has caught on fire MULTIPLE times, including the 1969 Cuyohoga fire that played a major role in inspiring the formation of the EPA and the Clean Water Act of 1972. That same fire even had a cameo in Dr. Seuss’ The Lorax.The stench of failure is so strong in Cleveland that the Indians were the franchise chosen to be featured in Major League. Other than Jim Brown, Otto Graham and Lebron, Roger Dorn is probably the city’s most treasured professional athlete.At least there is the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, which is basically a Hard Rock Café without the food.ONE DAY WE SHALL FIND OUT:Oklahoma City ThunderOne of my good friends and former college roommates is from Oklahoma City. His dad is an incredibly nice and smooth man who happens to own an oil and gas business and whose world view is equally shaped by attending college in Austin in the 1970s. If he were so inclined, I’d let him frack in my living room. Here is what he has to say about living in Oklahoma City: We may not have the beach and we may not have the mountains, but people sure smile and say hello when you pass them on the street.While it may have warmth and friendly strangers, I don’t know if that is enough for NBA free agents. And until Durant and Westbrook are no longer in the Sooner State, we will not find out. THAT KG FELLA WAS REAL TENACIOUS, DON’T YA KNOW?:Minnesota TimberwolvesIt is cold in Detroit. It is cold in Milwaukee. It is cold in Chicago. But only one United States city has an entire downtown system of enclosed pedestrian footbridges (Minneapolis Skyway System), so residents can walk in a climate-controlled environment year round. How fucking freezing does it have to be for a city to build an infrastructure so people never have to feel the outside air?Minneapolis is one of the more underrated American cities, but that designation mostly applies between Memorial and Labor Day. A July day on Lake Minnetonka is a Kenny Powers wet dream.But unless you’re an ice fishing enthusiast, there are better places for the young and absurdly rich to spend their winters.It does not help that the most notable retired former Timberwolf is Wally Szczerbiak.Light Beer and Sausages:Milwaukee BucksKareem played here, but after six seasons, forced a trade to the Lakers. In return, the Bucks received four guys I am certain you have never heard of. Oscar Robertson played here, but played the majority of his prime in Cincinnati. Ray Allen played here, but was traded after six and a half seasons along with a collection of spare parts for old Gary Payton (who left the next offseason) and Desmond Mason (who would play two more seasons for the Bucks). Expect to see the Bucks trade Giannis in three years for Deron Williams and Frank Kaminsky.The Bucks did have one of the better forgotten runs in NBA history between the 1970 and 1974 seasons, where they won an average of nearly 61 games per year. Their 1971 championship run led by Kareem and The Big O was among the most dominant in history, where they went 12-2 through the playoffs including a finals sweep.Most outside of Milwaukee forget that the Bucks’ success continued after Kareem and Oscar departed, when Sidney Moncrief led them to a decade of near excellence in the Reagan era. But their strong eighties teams have been greatly overshadowed by those great and better 76ers, Celtics and Pistons squads.  As for the rest of Wisconsin - it is shitty beer, the Packers, cheese, Madison and whatever the hell is going on in Manitowoc County.The New Orleans Jazz Moved to Utah, Where They don’t Allow Music:Utah JazzThe State of Utah is about 61% Mormon and 91% white. Approximately 1.27% of the population is African-American. No other U.S. state that has an NBA team has a smaller African-American population.If the Jazz could guarantee the NBA players/budding film producers that their projects would be admitted to Sundance, they might be able to field a dangerous team. A Baron Davis/Kobe/Lebron core could perhaps secure the 7th seed in the West.The Jazz do boast a rich history and a rabid fan base. But the very smart and talented front office knows that they operate in Utah, so they are better served building through the draft, where you can retain players against their will.",http://reddit.com/r/nba/comments/4cqo0y/c/d1kkbzi,1459440640,nba,NBA City Free Agency Power Rankings,0,4cqo0y,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/4cqo0y,1459382400

When we were last mostly healthy, even without MKG, we were the 2 seed.

8299,Good point.,6,"I have covered the NBA since the 2012-13 season, getting my start at ClipperBlog, a part of ESPN's TrueHoop Network, and later moving onto Bleacher Report and FOX Sports. I have also been published at ESPN and the Washington Post among others. I recently joined the Dime team at Uproxx and will be contributing there in the near future.I live in New York City and regularly cover Knicks and Nets games, but I still keep a close tab on the Clippers after growing up as the only Clips fan in the Tri State Area, thanks to Eric Piatkowski being amazing on Kobe Bryant NBA Courtside for N64. Feel free to ask about anything, though. I don't spend my nights watching random Bucks games for nothing. I'll be answering questions from 4 p.m. until a little after 6 p.m. ET.My work focuses on anything from personal features — like this fun one about watching a T'Wolves game with Karl-Anthony Towns' family — to more in-depth basketball analysis pieces — such as discussing Doc Rivers' sometimes questionable lineup decisions with Doc, himself.For more NBA analysis and seemingly out-of-nowhere rants, you can follow me on Twitter: @FredKatzUPDATE: I'm off for now, but will be back later and over the weekend to answer any other questions that any of you post in the coming hours or days. Had a great time, as always.
